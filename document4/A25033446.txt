REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1976 to June 1980.  

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in December 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims the Board is denying, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for periodontal disease; an acquired psychiatric disorder to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety; sleep apnea; and bleeding disorder; any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

New and Relevant Evidence

After February 19, 2019, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all the evidence of record.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).  A supplemental claim can be filed by a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.  Id. 

1. Whether new and relevant evidence was presented to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of service connection for anxiety

2. Whether new and relevant evidence was presented to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of service connection for depression

The Veteran asserts that his depression and anxiety are attributable to service.  See August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138).  

The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim in November 2018, which the AOJ denied in a February 2019 rating decision, finding that the Veteran's anxiety and depression were neither occurred in nor caused by service.  Although the Veteran submitted a statement with his claim indicating he took medication for his anxiety and depression, he did not offer a theory of entitlement to service connection for either disability. 

The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim in November 2022, which the VA found to be filed on an improper form.  See December 2022 Request for Application AMA Review Letter.  The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in June 2023.  In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  

Prior to the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran filed an August 2023 lay witness statement, asserting that his depression stems from a shipmate/friend being killed and buried at sea, and still has nightmares about his death.  The Veteran also stated that he endured discriminative and racial remarks, which caused his depression and anxiety.  Further, his severe depression stems from when he was informed that he would possibly be "exited" from service due to his complaints about discrimination issues.  It was strongly suggested by his executive officer that he not reenlist.  The Veteran also asserts that the death of his mother, dental trauma that was ongoing from dental surgery, and being singled out due to his dental state caused depression and anxiety.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 526EZ).  Additionally, the Veteran asserts that his depression is due to his service-connected right ankle condition, as he cannot run, jump, participate in activities, vacation, or play with his grandchildren.  See September 2019 Statement in Support of Claim.  As such, the Veteran raised a new theory of entitlement to service connection to depression secondary to service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  

In an August 2023 Private Examination Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) and Private treatment record, the Veteran was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD.    

The August 2023 statements, depression diagnosis, and secondary theory of entitlement are new, as such evidence was not previously part of the record before agency adjudicators.  The evidence is relevant as the statements and diagnosis tend to prove the current diagnosis, onset in service, and nexus elements at issue in the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).  Accordingly, new and relevant evidence has been received.  Therefore, adjudication is warranted, and, to that extent, the appeal is granted.  

3. Whether new and relevant evidence was presented to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of service connection for periodontal disease

The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim in November 2022, stating that while serving in Italy, he was hit in the mouth with a tool and his tooth was knocked out, requiring a false tooth.  He also alleged his records document his severe teeth issues.  After examining the Veteran and obtaining several opinions, the AOJ denied his claim for periodontal disease in a June 2023 rating decision, finding his preexisting condition was not permanently worsened as a result of service. The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in June 2023.  In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  

The Veteran asserts that his periodontal disease is related to service.  See July 2023 Lay Witness Statement (VA Form 21-10210).  Specifically, the Veteran contends that the Navy periodontal treatments were insufficient.  There should have been an established dental plan to treat his gingivitis before it developed into a more severe case of periodontal disease.  The Veteran also contends that his tooth was knocked out when he was struck in the mouth with a wrench, which caused his periodontal disease.  

The July 2023 statements are new, as such evidence was not previously part of the record before agency adjudicators.  The evidence is relevant as the statements tend to prove the onset in service element at issue in the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).  Accordingly, new and relevant evidence has been received.  Therefore, adjudication is warranted, and, to that extent, the appeal is granted.  

4. Whether new and relevant evidence was presented to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim of service connection for bleeding disorder

The Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim in November 2022, stating that while serving in Italy, he was hit in the mouth with a tool and his tooth was knocked out, requiring a false tooth.  He also alleged his records document his severe teeth issues and a bleeding disorder.  Without examining the Veteran, the AOJ denied his claim in a March 2023 rating decision, concluding the bleeding disorder neither occurred in nor was caused by service.  The March 2023 rating decision did not explicitly address whether the Veteran had a current disability for this condition.  

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in June 2023.  In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  

In statements received in August 2023, the Veteran and his wife asserted that his bleeding disorder is due to dental surgery during service with excessive bleeding issues.  See August 2023 Lay Witness Statement (VA Form 10210).  The statements explain that they contend the Veteran's in-service dental issues, including bleeding from his dental surgery, caused depression, anxiety and stress.  In another statement, the Veteran explained that the lack of treatment while in service for his periodontal disease will result in the continued loss of his teeth.  These statements do not, however, indicate he currently has a bleeding disorder.  

The August 2023 statements are new as such evidence was not part of the record before the agency adjudicators.  The evidence is relevant as the statements tend to prove the onset in service element at issue in the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). Further, as the Veteran and his wife's statements only discuss in-service bleeding of the Veteran's gums, this evidence also suggests the Veteran does not currently have a bleeding disorder of the mouth or gums.  As this evidence tends to disprove a matter at issue (i.e. whether the Veteran has a current bleeding disorder), it is also relevant.  Accordingly, new and relevant evidence has been received.  Therefore, adjudication is warranted, and, to that extent, the appeal is granted. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  The absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

A lay person is competent to report on the onset and reoccurrence of current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).? The Board must determine, on a?case-by-case?basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), the VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is due to service.  See January 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182); April 2024 Appellate Brief.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that serving on a ship and being around many loud machines caused his tinnitus.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ); December 2022, November 2023 VA Examination.   

Regarding the first element of service connection, in an August 2023 medical treatment record, a private ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physician diagnosed the Veteran with tinnitus of both ears.  See August 2023 Medical Treatment Record dated September 28, 2017; August 2023 Ear Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) dated August 10, 2023.  

Further, the Veteran reported recurrent ringing in his left ear to the ENT physician.  See August 2023 Medical Treatment Record dated September 28, 2017.  At the November 2023 and December 2022 VA examinations, the Veteran also reported having tinnitus in his left ear that has gradually become worse from when it first started.  See November 2023, December 2022 VA Examinations.  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as ringing or buzzing in his ears as this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 467-69 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).  In addition, the Veteran is competent to identify a disorder such as tinnitus for diagnostic purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 310; Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995).  The evidence shows that the Veteran has tinnitus in both ears.  Thus, the Veteran has a current bilateral tinnitus diagnosis, and the first element of service connection is met.  

The Board notes that the AOJ made the favorable finding in its December 2023 rating decision that the evidence shows a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset in service, due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Electricians Mate being consistent with acoustic trauma.  See December 2023 Rating Decision; DD-214.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  Thus, the second element of service connection is satisfied.  

As to the third element of service connection, nexus, the Board finds there is a causal connection between the in-service event and the Veteran's tinnitus.  The Board notes that the December 2022 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran reported tinnitus once every 3 months, lasting 3 hours at a time.  This is considered transient ear noise that occurs in the general population without auditory damage or pathology. According to a study by Dauman and Tyler (1992) cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler), tinnitus is defined as head or ear noise lasting at least 5 min and occurring more than once a week. The Veteran's description does not fit this definition. This transient ear noise is not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus and is less likely than not related to military noise exposure.  

In a November 2023 VA examination, the examiner provided a negative nexus opinion.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's description of symptoms does not meet the Dauman and Tyler (1992) definition of tinnitus cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler).  The Veteran reports transient ear noise that occurs in the general population without auditory damage or pathology.  This transient ear noise is not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus and is less likely than not related to military noise exposure.  Etiology of tinnitus is not warranted when symptomatology and clinical exam findings do not indicate a diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus.  

The Board finds that the December 2022 and the November 2023 VA examiners' opinions are inadequate as the examiners did not sufficiently address the Veteran's reported symptom onset and history.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 262 (2020) (holding that where the examiner failed to address the veteran's lay evidence and the Board fails to find the veteran not credible or not competent to offer that lay evidence, the proper remedy is for VA to obtain a new examination).  Further, the November 2023 VA examiner did not consider the Veteran's report of recurrent tinnitus or the diagnosis of bilateral tinnitus from the ENT physician.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007) (an opinion is inadequate when the examiner does not consider the Veteran's medical history).  

The Veteran reported that noise exposure on ships and his MOS caused his tinnitus.  See March 2023 VA Examination; January 2023 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ).   The Veteran stated that he has recurrent tinnitus, characterized as ringing in his left ear that has gradually worsened since its onset in service.  See August 2023 Medical Treatment Record dated September 28, 2017; November 2023, December 2022 VA Examinations.  

The Veteran has competently and credibly indicated that he experienced symptoms of tinnitus, which has progressively worsened, and was caused by his MOS.  As mentioned in the analysis above, the Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as ringing or buzzing in his ears as this requires only personal knowledge, as it comes through senses.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 467-69; Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 309.  In addition, the Veteran is competent to identify a disorder such as tinnitus for diagnostic purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 310; Charles, 16 Vet. App. at 374 (2002); Falzone, 8 Vet. App. at 405. The Veteran has competently and credibly reported his experiences of tinnitus symptoms that have gradually worsened since service.  Thus, there is a causal connection between the in-service event and the Veteran's tinnitus.  As such, the third element of service connection is met.  

For the above reasons, the probative evidence of the record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's current tinnitus disability is attributable to service.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine therefore does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017).  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss

The Veteran contends that his right ear hearing loss is due to service.  See January 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182); April 2024 Appellate Brief.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his MOS, machinery on the ship, missiles, and loud engine noises from the ship caused his right ear hearing loss.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ); December 2022, November 2023 VA Examination; November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim (VA 21-4138).  

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a "disability" when the auditory thresholds in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Hearing loss for VA purposes does not constitute a "disability" if it does not meet these threshold requirements.  Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 179-80 (2007).

When the AOJ makes a favorable finding in the AMA review system, it cannot be reversed except on a showing of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c), any prior favorable finding is binding on all subsequent adjudicators unless rebutted by evidence that the finding was CUE.

In order to find clear and unmistakable error in a prior adjudication, the following three-prong test must be proved: (1) either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the adjudicator (i.e., there must be more than a simple disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated) or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the error must be undebatable and of the sort which, had it not been made, would manifestly have changed the outcome at the time it was made; and (3) a determination that there was clear and unmistakable error must be based upon the record and law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question.  Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242 (1992); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310 (1992).  

Here, the Veteran has not established a current right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  The Board notes that the AOJ made the favorable finding in the December 2023 rating decision that the Veteran was diagnosed with right ear hearing loss.  See December 2023 Rating Decision; August 2023 DBQ dated August 10, 2023.  However, the Board finds this finding was a clear and unmistakable error.

The Veteran underwent a VA audiological examination in December 2022.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with right ear sensorineural hearing loss in frequency range of 6000 Hz or higher frequencies.  Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 94 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear.  The examiner assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 12/2022	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 25	15 	15	25 	25

LEFT	 15	15 	15 	40 	30 

Notably, the results indicate that the Veteran does not have auditory thresholds in the 500, 1000, 20000, 3000 and 4000 hertz frequencies greater than 40 decibels in the right ear.  The results also indicate that the Veteran's auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are not 26 decibels or greater in the right ear.  Further, the Veteran scored a 94 percent in the speech recognition score in his right ear.  Therefore, the December 2022 VA examination unequivocally establishes that the Veteran did not have right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.      

The Veteran underwent a second VA audiological examination in November 2023.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with right ear sensorineural hearing loss in frequency range of 6000 Hz or higher frequencies.  Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear.  The examiner assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 11/2023	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 25	20 	20	25 	25

LEFT	 15	20 	20 	35 	30 

Notably, the results indicate that the Veteran does not have auditory thresholds in the 500, 1000, 20000, 3000 and 4000 hertz frequencies greater than 40 decibels in the right ear.  The results also indicate that the Veteran's auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are not 26 decibels or greater in the right ear.  Further, the Veteran scored a 94 percent in the speech recognition score in his right ear.  Based on the audiological findings, the Veteran was found to not have right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.    

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a private treatment record containing multiple audiological examinations, where the clinician diagnosed the Veteran with noise-induced hearing loss, bilateral.  See August 2023 DBQ; August 2023 Private Treatment Records.  In an August 2016 evaluation, the clinician assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 08/2016	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	10 	5	10 	15

LEFT	 20	10 	5 	10 	15 

See August 2023 Private Treatment Records dated August 2016.  

Another audiological examination was conducted in August 2017.  The clinician assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 08/2017	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	15 	10	15 	20

LEFT	-		- 	30 	25 	25 

Another audiological examination was conducted in August 2018.  The clinician assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 08/2018	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	15 	10	15 	20

LEFT	 25	30 	15 	15 	20 

Another audiological examination was conducted in September 2019.  The clinician assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 09/2019	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 25	20 	15	25 	30

LEFT	 30	30 	20 	25 	30 

Another audiological examination was conducted in September 2020.  The clinician assessed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 09/2020	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 20	15 	15	20 	30

LEFT	 25	20 	15 	25 	35 

Notably, the results from each of the private audiological evaluations from August 2018 through September 2020 indicate that the Veteran does not have auditory thresholds in the 500, 1000, 20000, 3000 and 4000 hertz frequencies greater than 40 decibels in the right ear.  The results also indicate that the Veteran's auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are not 26 decibels or greater in the right ear.  The Board is also not permitted to use speech recognition scoring from these private evaluations, as the private clinician did not use Maryland CNC testing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.      

The Board finds that there is CUE to rebut the favorable finding of a current right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  As noted above, even though the Veteran was diagnosed with right ear hearing loss at higher frequencies, he does not meet any of the criteria for right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  It is undebatable that at no point did he have auditory thresholds in the 500, 1000, 20000, 3000 and 4000 hertz frequencies greater than 40 decibels in the right ear.  The results also indicate that the Veteran's auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz are not 26 decibels or greater in the right ear.  At no point did the Veteran score below a 94 percent for the competent speech recognition scores using Maryland CNC testing.  

Therefore, the weight of the evidence does not show that the Veteran has a right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes. Without a showing of a current right ear hearing loss disability that meets the standards of the applicable regulation set forth by Congress, service connection cannot be established for a right ear hearing loss disability.  Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (The absence of any one element will result in the denial of service connection).  The level of right ear hearing loss shown by the Veteran does not constitute a disability for VA purposes.  

For the above reasons, the probative evidence of the record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is attributable to service.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine therefore does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017).  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is not warranted, and the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; 3.303; 3.385.

Increased Rating

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for service-connected left ear hearing loss  

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for his service-connected left ear hearing loss.  See June 2023 Supplemental Claim.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that his hearing damage has progressed, due to his MOS, machinery on the ship, missiles, and loud engine noises from the ship.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ); December 2022, November 2023 VA Examination; November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim (VA 21-4138).  

When a Veteran seeks an increased evaluation, it will generally be presumed that the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation is sought, and it follows that such a claim remains in controversy where less than the maximum benefit available is awarded.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where the question to consider is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged" rating are required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).  

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.   

Although the Veteran's symptomatology is the primary consideration, the Veteran's level of impairment must be in "most areas" applicable to the relevant percentage rating criteria.  See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).  

In a March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for left ear hearing loss and assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective August 25, 2022.  See March 2023 Rating Decision.  

The Veteran's left ear hearing loss is rated under DC 6100.  

Disability ratings for hearing loss are assigned based on the results of controlled speech discrimination tests combined with the results of pure tone audiometry tests.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.85-4.86.  An examination for VA rating purposes must be conducted by a state-licensed audiologist and must include a controlled speech discrimination test, specifically, the Maryland CNC test, and a pure tone audiometry test.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a).  Further, disability ratings for hearing impairment are assigned through a structured formula, i.e., a mechanical application of the rating schedule to numeric designations that are assigned after audiometric evaluations have been rendered.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  

First, a Roman numeral designation of I through XI is assigned for the level of hearing impairment in each ear.  Table VI is used to determine a Roman numeral designation based on a combination of the speech discrimination percentage and the average pure tone threshold, or the sum of the pure tone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, divided by four.  After a Roman numeral designation has been assigned for each ear, Table VII is used to determine the compensation rate by combining such designations for hearing impairment in both ears.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

When the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  When the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).  

If, as here, impaired hearing of only one ear is service-connected, and hearing impairment in the other ear (the non-service connected ear) does not meet the definition of "hearing loss" for VA purpose, the non-service-connected ear will be assigned a Roman Numeral designation for hearing impairment of Level I. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.383(a), 4.85(f).

After reviewing the relevant medical and lay evidence and applying the above laws and regulations, the Board finds that Veteran is not entitled to an initial compensable evaluation for left ear hearing loss.  

On the VA audiological evaluation in December 2022, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:   

12/2022	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg

RIGHT	15	15	25	25	20

LEFT	15	15	40	30	25

The Maryland CNC speech discrimination score was 94 percent in the left ear.  Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation Level I in the left ear.  As the VA audiological testing shows that the nonservice connected right ear does not have hearing loss for VA purposes, the right ear will be assigned Level I.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level I for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable disability rating under DC 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

On the VA audiological evaluation in November 2023, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:   

11/2023	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg

RIGHT	20	20	25	25	23

LEFT	20	20	35	30	27

The Maryland CNC speech discrimination score was 94 percent in the left ear.  Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation Level I in the left ear.  As the VA audiological testing shows that the nonservice connected right ear does not have hearing loss for VA purposes, the right ear will be assigned Level I.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level I for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable disability rating under DC 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, an initial compensable evaluation for the Veteran's hearing loss is not warranted.  

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including that his hearing damage has progressed, due to his MOS, machinery on the ship, missiles, and loud engine noises from the ship.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ); December 2022, November 2023 VA Examination; November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim (VA 21-4138).  The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Although the Board has considered his relevant lay statements of record, audiometric testing conducted by a state-licensed audiologist is required to evaluate the severity of his hearing impairment for VA compensation purposes.  As there is no evidence of record establishing that the Veteran is a state-licensed audiologist, he is not competent to provide evidence regarding the severity of his left ear hearing loss disability in terms of puretone thresholds and speech discrimination percentage.  Therefore, the Board must rely on the competent and credible medical evidence of record.

Further, the Board notes the Veteran contends that the severity of his left ear hearing loss warrants a higher rating.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reported hearing loss symptoms and need for hearing aids related to his hearing loss disability; however, schedular disability ratings for hearing loss are based on the results of the objective audiological studies of record. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  Moreover, the rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact that the Veteran describes, is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Given the above, the Board finds that the December 2022 and November 2023 VA examinations are the most probative, competent evidence of record bearing on the severity of the Veteran's hearing impairment throughout the appeal period.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for left ear hearing loss.  As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against an initial compensable evaluation, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The Board notes that no other issues were raised by the Veteran or the representative, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  Therefore, the Veteran's claim is denied.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for periodontal disease is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his periodontal disease is related to service.  See July 2023 Lay Witness Statement (VA Form 21-10210).  Specifically, the Veteran contends that the Navy periodontal treatments were insufficient.  There should have been an established dental plan to treat his gingivitis before it developed into a more severe case of periodontal disease.  The Veteran also contends that his tooth was knocked out when he was struck in the mouth with a wrench, which caused his periodontal disease.  

In the June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made several findings related to the Veteran's periodontal disease.  First, the AOJ determined that the Veteran's periodontal disease existed prior to military service, stating the Veteran was diagnosed with periodontal disease upon entering the military in 1976.  The AOJ also determined the Veteran was treated for periodontal disease during military service, based on dental service treatment records in 1980, prior to Veterans separation from the military.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2023.  The Veteran reported that he could not remember if his gum disease was present prior to joining the military but he remembers at his entrance exam, he was lined up during boot camp and they did an oral exam. They told him he had periodontal disease upon entering the military.  The examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran was initially diagnosed with periodontal disease upon his entrance exam into the military. He subsequently has had issues with his teeth ever since and has had to get some teeth removed due to bone loss related to the periodontal disease.  His periodontal disease is still active today.  Periodontal disease is a type of gum disease that can erode the bone supporting the teeth.  It can happen to anyone who has poor oral hygiene and some people are more genetically prone to the disease than others.  According to Veterans files, he was first diagnosed with severe periodontal disease in August 1976, right after he joined the military.  It is less likely than not that his periodontal disease was caused by an in-service event, injury or illness, since periodontal disease is mainly caused by poor oral hygiene.  He more likely than not had periodontal disease prior to joining the military and was only aware of his diagnosis upon joining.  His periodontal disease has progressed since his exit from the military, but not to an abnormal extent.  

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in June 2023.  The examiner opined that the claimed condition, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran was initially diagnosed with periodontal disease upon entering the military in 1976.  Notes in dental service treatment records (STRs) indicate a diagnosis of severe localized periodontal disease in 1976, with a continued diagnosis of periodontal disease noted in dental STRs in 1980, prior to the Veteran's separation from the military.  The Veteran's records indicate active periodontal disease in 1987, 1995, 2011, and 2022.  Periodontal disease is defined as an infection of the tissues that hold your teeth in place, and is typically caused by poor brushing and flossing habits that allow plaque to build up on the teeth and harden.  It was noted in the Veteran's files that he had plaque and calculus build up on his teeth in 1979, 1995, 1998, 2011, and 2022.  He received dental treatment while in service, which included cleanings and deep pocket scaling in 1976, 1978, 1979, and 1980. While his periodontal disease did not improve while in service, measures were taken by dental to monitor and help the disease from progressing.  It is likely the Veterans pre-existing periodontal disease was not aggravated beyond its natural progression by his time in service, and more likely the disease was progressing at a natural rate, given the history of the Veterans poor oral hygiene.  

Contrary to the AOJ's finding, the Board finds the Veteran was presumed sound upon entry to service.  The Veteran's report of medical examination upon his enlistment in June 1976 is not in the claims file, so it is unclear what conditions, if any, were noted upon the Veteran's entrance to active duty.  Therefore, the Veteran was presumed sound upon his entry to active duty.  The presumption of soundness can only be rebutted by clear and unmistakable (undebatable) evidence that the Veteran's periodontal disease existed prior to this entry into active duty in June 1976 and if so, undebatable evidence that his periodontal disease was not aggravated by service.  

The Veteran started active-duty service in June 1976 and the first indication of periodontal disease was in August 1976, where severe localized periodontitis was diagnosed.  See January 2016 STRs dated August 10, 1976; DD-214.  Even so, neither the AOJ nor the VA examiners identify the clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's periodontal disease preexisted his entry to service and was not aggravated by service.  Both the AOJ and VA examiners applied the wrong legal standard in evaluating the Veteran's claim.  Further, the examiners did not provide sufficient rationale.  They did not explain if the Veteran had poor dental hygiene during service and how that may have caused or aggravated the Veteran's periodontal disease.  To be adequate, a medical opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 256 (2019).  

Given the foregoing, a remand is warranted to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion regarding the Veteran's periodontal disease.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).  The failure to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, thus a remand is appropriate.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his acquired psychiatric disorder is attributable to service.  See August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138).  Specifically, the Veteran contends that a shipmate/friend being killed and buried at sea and discrimination during service caused his depression and anxiety.  See August 2023 Lay Witness Statement.  The Veteran also contends that the death of his mother, dental trauma that was ongoing from dental surgery, and being singled out due to his dental state caused his depression.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 526EZ).  Further, the Veteran contends that his depression is secondary to his service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  See September 2019 Statement in Support of Claim.  Finally, in a statement received in August 2023, the Veteran's wife contends that the Veteran was diagnosed with depression in 1989 at a military base.

The Veteran submitted a November 2022 DBQ, in which he was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  See November 2022 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).  

The Board acknowledges that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any psychiatric disability that may reasonably be encompassed by a veteran's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). In light of the Court's holding in Clemons, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  

The Board notes that the Veteran was never afforded a VA examination for his acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  

A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary in a claim for service connection when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-86 (2006).  See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).

The third prong of the analysis sets a "low threshold."  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  As the Court explained in McLendon, evidence that might indicate a potential association between a current disability and service may include "medical evidence that suggests a nexus but is too equivocal or lacking in specificity to support a decision on the merits, or credible evidence of continuity of symptomatology such as pain or other symptoms capable of lay observation."  Id. 

The low threshold requires that the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a causal nexus between the disability or persistent symptoms of a disability and military service.  Id.  

The McLendon elements are satisfied with regard to the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  Regarding the first element, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  See November 2022 DBQ.  Regarding the second element, the Veteran asserts that his depression and anxiety stem from a shipmate/friend being killed and buried at sea, in which he still has nightmares about his death.  See August 2023 Lay Witness Statement.  The Veteran also stated that he endured discriminative and racial remarks, which caused his depression and anxiety.  Further, his severe depression stems from when he was informed that he would possibly be "exited" from service due to his complaints about discrimination issues.  It was strongly suggested by his executive officer that he not reenlist.  The Veteran also asserts that the death of his mother, dental issues that were ongoing from dental surgery, and being singled out due to his dental state caused his depression and anxiety.  See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 526EZ).  The Veteran's statements show an in-service event.  Regarding the third and fourth elements, there is an indication that the acquired psychiatric disorder could be related to the Veteran's statements regarding in-service events, but there is insufficient evidence of record by which the Board can decide the appeal.  As the four McLendon elements are satisfied, the Veteran is entitled to a VA medical examination and opinion.  

Additionally, as noted above, the Veteran contends that his depression is secondary to his service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  See September 2019 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Board finds the AOJ erred when it failed to develop and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety as secondary to service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  

Moreover, remand for development is also required as the AOJ erred by not attempting to confirm the Veteran's stressors of a shipmate/friend being killed and buried at sea, and discrimination in service.  

Therefore, the Board finds remand for development, and a VA medical examination and opinion is needed to determine whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety is attributable to service; and acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety as secondary to service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

3. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his sleep apnea is due to service.  See August 2017 Fully Developed Claim.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that exposure to military elements contributed to sleep apnea.  See August 2023 Lay Statement.  The Veteran reported that he burned feces on the USS Inflict in 1980, and that exposure to military contaminants contributed to sleep apnea.  See August 2023 Lay Statement; November 2022 Buddy/Lay Statement.  

In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from a sleep study completed by the Virginia Neurology Sleep Centers in September 2016.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023, where the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of OSA.  The examiner opined that the OSA is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner reasoned that there is no STR evidence that provides support of a diagnosis of OSA. Medical records show that the Veteran had symptoms that began around 2010 and he was discharged from the military in 1980, which is a significant lapse in time.  Thus, a nexus cannot be established.

The Board finds that a remand for a new VA medical opinion is warranted as the December 2023 VA examiner did not provide adequate rationale for the opinion, only relying on the lack of evidence in the service treatment records to support the conclusion.  To be adequate, a medical opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 256 (2019).  Further, the examiner did not consider the Veteran's lay statements that exposure to military contaminants and burning feces on the USS Inflict in 1980 caused sleep apnea.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 262 (2020) (holding that where the examiner failed to address the veteran's lay evidence and the Board fails to find the veteran not credible or not competent to offer that lay evidence, the proper remedy is for VA to obtain a new examination).  

Additionally, remand for development is also required as the Veteran stated he was diagnosed with OSA in December 2014, with symptoms beginning in 2010.  See November 2022 Sleep Apnea DBQ; December 2023 VA Examination.  The Veteran reported that he served in the Reserves from June 1981 to December 1998.  See August 2017, November 2018 Fully Developed Claim.  The Individual Exposure Summary Information (ILER) shows that the Veteran was in the Reserves as late as August 2017.  See April 2023 ILER.  The Veteran also stated that he travelled overseas, to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean.  See November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.  However, there are few military personnel files of record regarding the Veteran's Reserve service, any periods of active duty for training (ADT) or inactive duty training (IDT), and any periods of service overseas during such time.  The Veteran stated he was diagnosed with OSA in December 2014, with symptoms beginning in 2010, which may have been caused by a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) relating to periods of this service.  The evidence is insufficient for the Board to make this determination.  The Board finds the AOJ erred in not attempting to obtain the Veteran's complete military personnel records, including any Reserve records.  

Given the foregoing, a remand is warranted for development and to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion regarding the Veteran's sleep apnea.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).  The failure to develop and to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, thus a remand is appropriate.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

4. Entitlement to service connection for bleeding disorder is remanded.

As discussed above, the Veteran claimed service connection for a bleeding disorder of his mouth/gums caused by dental surgery during service.  Id.  

As the Board has found that new and relevant evidence has been submitted and readjudication is proper, remand is necessary for the AOJ to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for bleeding disorder on the merits in the first instance.  See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010) (reflecting that, when the Board reopens a claim after the AOJ has denied reopening that same claim, the matter generally must be returned to the AOJ for consideration on the merits so as to preserve for the claimant the one review on appeal as provided by 38 U.S.C. § 7104); see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  

When readjudicating the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a bleeding disorder of the gums or teeth, the AOJ should clearly indicate in its future rating decision whether the Veteran has a current bleeding disorder of the mouth/gums, to include residuals from bleeding associated with in-service dental surgery.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Attempt to obtain the Veteran's complete military personnel file, including all Reserve records.  If any records or information sought are unavailable, the AOJ should issue a formal finding documenting such fact and the reason for such unavailability.  The AOJ should also clearly document the dates of the Veteran's Reserve service, to include any period of ADT and IDT.

2. Obtain a medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's periodontal disease. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand and any evidence obtained by this remand, must be reviewed by the clinician and such review should be noted in the examination report. Schedule the Veteran for an examination if deemed necessary by the clinician.  The clinician is asked to respond to the following:

(a)	Does the evidence of record clearly and unmistakably show that the Veteran's periodontal disease existed prior to his entry into active duty in June 1986? If yes, please state why and identify the clear and unmistakable evidence?  If no, why not?

(b)	If yes, does the evidence of record clearly and unmistakably show that the preexisting periodontal disease was not aggravated by service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progression of the disease?  Please identify any such evidence to support this conclusion with specificity

(b) If the answer to (b) is no, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's periodontal disease is related to, or developed during, the Veteran's active duty service, to include the loss of his tooth.  

The clinician should address the Veteran's statements in the July 2023 Lay Witness Statement (VA Form 21-10210) that the Navy periodontal treatments were insufficient, there should have been an established dental plan to treat the gingivitis, and that his tooth being knocked out by a wrench caused his periodontal disease. 

The clinician is reminded that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, treatment, and injuries, and that such reports must be considered in formulating the requested opinion. If the clinician rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide a rationale for doing so.

In answering questions (a) and (b), the clinician is advised that the evidentiary standard for whether a condition existed prior to service is "clear and unmistakable," which is a formidable evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the non-aggravation result be "undebatable."

A complete rationale should be provided.

3. Attempt to verify the Veteran's alleged in-service stressors, including the death of his shipmate/friend and discrimination in service.  

4. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, depression, and anxiety.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand and any evidence obtained from this remand, must be reviewed by the clinician and such review should be noted in the examination report.  The clinician is asked to respond to the following: 

(a) Clearly identify all psychiatric disorders, which have existed since approximately November 2022, the date of the Veteran's claim.

(b)  If the examiner finds that the Veteran meets the criteria for PTSD, the examiner must identify the specific stressor(s) underlying any PTSD diagnosis and comment upon the link between the current symptomatology and the Veteran's stressor(s)

(c) Then, as to any psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, the examiner should indicate whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that a current acquired psychiatric disorder, had its onset in or is related to service.  

(d) If not, whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was caused by his service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  

(e) If no, whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was aggravated (worsened) by his service-connected right ankle tendonitis status post ankle fracture.  

The clinician should address the Veterans depression and anxiety diagnosis in the November 2022 DBQ; the Veteran's lay statements regarding the death and burial of his friend at sea in the August 2023 Lay Witness Statement; the statements regarding discrimination in the August 2023 Lay Witness Statement; and the statements regarding his right ankle condition causing depression in his September 2019 Statement in Support of Claim.  

The clinician is reminded that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, treatment, and injuries, and that such reports must be considered in formulating the requested opinion. If the clinician rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide a rationale for doing so.

A complete rationale for each opinion and conclusion should be provided.

5. Obtain a medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand and any evidence obtained by this remand, must be reviewed by the clinician and such review should be noted in the examination report. Schedule the Veteran for an examination if deemed necessary by the clinician.  The clinician is asked to respond to the following:

(a) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in or is related to service.  

The clinician should address the Veteran's statements that he was exposed to burning feces on board the USS Inflict in 1980 from the November 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.  

The clinician is reminded that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, treatment, and injuries, and that such reports must be considered in formulating the requested opinion. If the clinician rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide a rationale for doing so.

6. Readjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for a bleeding disorder.  

7. Ensure that the VA medical opinions obtained includes a complete rationale for the conclusions reached. The medical opinions must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
