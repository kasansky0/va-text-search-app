ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected right ankle degenerative arthritis, other than post traumatic with tendinopathy status post (s/p) complete rupture posterior tibial tendon and triple arthrodesis, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. No appealable rating decision concerning entitlement to an increased rating for a right ankle disability was issued after February 2023.

2. To the extent the Veteran may have sought to appeal the prior denial of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to October 24, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter, for a service-connected right ankle disability in the February 2023 rating decision, his January 2, 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), was received more than one year after the February 2023 rating decision; therefore, the notice of disagreement is untimely.  No good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the filing period, and the Board did not waive (implicitly or explicitly) the timeliness of a VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected right ankle degenerative arthritis, other than post traumatic with tendinopathy status post (s/p) complete rupture posterior tibial tendon and triple arthrodesis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1966 to October 1971 and from September 1974 to September 1989, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Veteran is in receipt of a Combat Infantryman Badge and a Bronze Star Medal with "V" Device and Oak Leaf Cluster.

By way of background, in January 2021 VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for service connection "ankle sprain," related to a 1967 ankle fracture.

On March 9, 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision that granted the Veteran service connection for left and right lateral collateral ligament sprain, each with an initial 10 percent evaluation, effective January 21, 2021.  A March 11, 2021, notification letter informed the Veteran of the March 2021 rating decision and that he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option in order to protect his initial filing date for effective date purposes.  See March 11, 2021, Notification Letter.

In October 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application wherein he sought review of the March 2021 rating decision as to the ratings assigned for his bilateral ankle disability.

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ noting "pain and decreased range of motion of right ankle after surgery."

In a February 2023 supplemental claim decision, the AOJ recharacterized the Veteran's service-connected right lateral collateral ligament sprain to degenerative arthritis, other than posttraumatic tendinopathy s/p complete rupture posterior tibial tendon and triple arthrodesis, and increased his rating from 10 percent to 20 percent, effective the date of receipt of the Veteran's October 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on February 13, 2023.

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-526EZ which was specific to the left ankle and silent concerning the right ankle.

An August 9, 2024, rating decision continued the Veteran's 10 percent rating for his service-connected left lateral collateral ligament sprain with degenerative arthritis.

Later in August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking review of the August 2024 rating decision concerning the right ankle (which was not adjudicated in the August 2024 rating decision).  A December 2024 notice informed the Veteran that his HLR request was ineligible as there had been no decision issued concerning the right ankle in the past year.  See December 13, 2024, Request for Application AMA Review Letter

On January 2, 2025, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) wherein he identified the August 2024 rating decision, elected the Direct Review option, and wrote in part, "fracture of right ankle during physical training." No mention of the left ankle was included on the Notice of Disagreement.

On January 10, 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a notice of disagreement clarification letter.

On January 31, 2025, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 10182, this time electing the Evidence Submission option and identifying the August 2024 rating decision.  On his 10182, the Veteran wrote again about fracturing his right ankle in-service but made no statements concerning his left ankle.

On February 4, 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a letter acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's January 2, 2025, VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the Evidence Submission Docket.

Entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected right ankle degenerative arthritis, other than post traumatic with tendinopathy status post (s/p) complete rupture posterior tibial tendon and triple arthrodesis, is dismissed.  

The Veteran's claim falls under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). VA regulations, under the AMA, require that a properly completed notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) must be received within one year from the date that the AOJ mailed the notice of the decision being appealed.  The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).

Here, the Veteran's notification letter for the February 10, 2023, rating decision was dated February 13, 2023.  The letter notified the Veteran that if he did not agree with the decision, he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option in order to protect the initial filing date for effective date purposes.  The AOJ specifically wrote, "You must file your request on the required application form for the review option desired." The notification letter provided the Veteran with the available review options and the respective required application forms. See VA Notification Letter, February 13, 2023.

The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or initiate a Board appeal concerning the right ankle, within one year of the February 13, 2023, rating decision notification letter.  Therefore, the February 2023 rating decision became final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

The January 2, 2025, VA Form 10182 addressed the single issue of "fracture of right ankle during physical training while in US Army." The Veteran identified the date of the decision he disagreed with as August 22, 2024.  However, the only issue concerning the ankle in the August 2024 rating decision was related to an increased rating for the Veteran's already service-connected left ankle.  The last rating decision addressing the right ankle was the February 2023 rating decision.  As such, this notice of disagreement was received more than one year after the notification of the February 2023 rating decision, and is, therefore, untimely.

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024); Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2021) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).  The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension and has not provided good cause to extend the filing period, and no other arguable waiver is applicable here.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c) (permitting an extension of the deadline to file a notice of disagreement for good cause shown).

The Board has also considered whether it waived any procedural defects by virtue of docketing the AMA appeal.  See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (finding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal" for over five years).  The Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 on January 2, 2025. The Board sent a letter in February 2025 acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the Evidence Submission Docket.  The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of procedural defects.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the January 2, 2025, VA Form 10182, the Board finds the January 2, 2025 VA Form 10182 was, and remains, untimely.

There was no appealable decision within one year prior to the January 2, 2025, VA Form 10182 related to the right ankle, and the appeal must be dismissed for failure to comply with the claims processing rules.

The Board notes that the Veteran is free to file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) along with new and relevant evidence should he wish to further pursue his claim for an increased rating for his service-connected right ankle disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.
