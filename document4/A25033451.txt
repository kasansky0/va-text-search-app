DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, to include jungle rot, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had an onset during service, and he has had chronic and continuous symptoms since that time.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1972 to August 1976.  

This matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In June 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 and requested a Board hearing.  A Board hearing was provided in April 2025.  Accordingly, the Board can consider the evidence of record as of June 5, 2024-which is the record before the AOJ as of the rating decision on appeal-as well as any additional evidence submitted as of the date of the hearing and within 90 days following receipt of that the hearing.  38?C.F.R. § 20.303.

Although the Veteran's timeframe for switching dockets has not expired, seeking waiver of that right prior to adjudication at this time is not necessary as this decision represents a full award of benefits sought by the Veteran regarding the tinnitus claim, as well as a remand for further development of the skin disorder claim and does not constitute a final decision on that matter.  Therefore, the Veteran is not prejudiced by the adjudication of these claims.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Tinnitus is considered by VA to be an organic disease of the nervous system, which is a "chronic disease" listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service.  For the showing of "chronic disease" in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of "continuity of symptoms" after service is required for service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Where a veteran served 90 days or more of active service, and those certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.  Id.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that the AOJ made a favorable finding of a current disability for tinnitus based on the May 2024 VA examination report.  See June 2024 rating decision.  It also made a favorable finding regarding an in-service event, specifically exposure to noise during military service and the onset of tinnitus during service.

A September 2011 VA examination report reflects the Veteran's report of recurrent tinnitus, which he first noticed around radios and televisions while in the military.  The examiner stated that she could not provide a medical opinion regarding etiology of tinnitus without resorting to speculation.

A May 2024 VA examination report reflects review of the claims file and the Veteran's report of recurrent tinnitus, specifically an intermittent high-pitch ringing in both ears since being discharged.  The examiner opined that it was less likely than not a symptom associated with the Veteran's hearing loss.  His tinnitus was reported as longstanding and beginning in service.  Service treatment records (STRs) documented the absence of hearing loss and standard threshold shift during service.  The examiner also opined that it was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure as his reported symptoms claimed as tinnitus did not meet the definition of tinnitus as outlined in the Tinnitus Handbook.  His statements of subjective changes to his hearing could best be described as transient ear noise, which was not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus.

The Board acknowledges that the May 2024 VA examiner found that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of in-service noise exposure.  Regardless, tinnitus is a chronic disease that may be presumptively linked to military service.  The September 2011 VA examination report reflects that he reported first noticing tinnitus during service, and the May 2024 VA examination report reflects his report of recurrent tinnitus since being discharged.

At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he had ringing in his ears off and on since discharge from military service in 1976.  He stated that it began during service, although he did not pay too much attention to it because it was not that bad, but really started to notice it after separation from service.  His spouse testified that she remembered the Veteran complaining about ringing in his ears since they've been married and going together, which was approximately 1980-ish.

The lay evidence regarding an onset during service is probative, as the Board finds that it is both competent and credible.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's tinnitus was incurred in active service; thus, the criteria for direct service connection are met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, if the Board identifies a duty to assist error that existed at the time of the AOJ's decision on the claim under review, the claim must be returned for correction of the error and readjudication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(g).  As the Board has identified duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal, the issue discussed below must be remanded.

In June 2024, the AOJ conceded participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) based on the Veteran's service in Vietnam and offshore eligible waters.  It also made a favorable finding of a current disability based on a January 2024 assessment of tinea ungium.  However, he was never provided a VA examination.

Based on the favorable findings of a current skin diagnosis and conceded in-service TERA, a VA examination is warranted and must be obtained on remand.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).

The Board notes that the Veteran also raised other theories of entitlement at his April 2025 Board hearing, which must be addressed on remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate qualified examiner to determine the nature and etiology of his claimed skin disorder.  The claims file, and a copy of this remand, will be available to the examiner.  All tests deemed necessary should be performed and the results reported in detail.

After review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, the examiner must confirm any and all skin diagnoses, specifically involving the feet, groin, and back, to include fungal infection of the toenail, erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica, plantar keratoderma, nub lesion of the mid upper back, skin tags, onychomycosis, tinea pedis, tinea ungium, and xerosis cutis, and if possible the onset of each.

For each diagnosis found, the examiner must opine whether it either began during service or is otherwise the result of military service, to include having to walk and live in humid, muggy weather when serving in the Republic of Vietnam.

The examiner must also opine whether the skin disorder is caused by or related to Camp Lejeune water contamination and exposure to herbicide agents.  See June 2024, February 2025 VA memoranda.

In providing this opinion, the examiner is asked to consider total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.

The examiner should consider the Veteran's lay statements about the onset of his symptomatology, his statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since onset and/or since discharge from service, and any supporting lay statements.

If a direct relationship to service cannot be found, then the examiner must opine whether the Veteran's skin disorder is (1) caused by, or (2) aggravated (i.e., worsened) by his service-connected disabilities, to specifically include his diabetes mellitus type II.

The examiner must provide thorough explanations and support for any opinions expressed.  The examiner is reminded that separate and distinct opinions with supporting rationales must be provided for all theories of entitlement, including secondary causation and secondary aggravation.
