DOCKET NO. 220512-245897
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

A disability rating of 100 percent for major depressive disorder with anxiety from April 1, 2020, but no earlier, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Since April 1, 2020, the nature, frequency, and severity of the Veteran's symptoms of her service-connected depression have caused total occupational and social impairment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Since April 1, 2020, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 100 percent for depression have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 2009 to April 2018, including service in Iraq. The Board recognizes her service to our country, and the sacrifices it necessarily entailed.

This matter is on appeal to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a September 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is also the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In December 2020, the Veteran sought an increased rating for her service-connected depression. In March 2021, the AOJ granted an increased rating to 70 percent, effective December 10, 2020. 

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), seeking review of the March 2021 decision. The AOJ treated the HLR as a Supplemental Claim, to address additional evidence the Veteran had submitted with the HLR. In September 2021, the AOJ readjudicated the Veteran's claim considering the new and relevant evidence and denied the increased rating.

In the May 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement or NOD), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. In April 2025, the Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge, and waived her right to post-hearing evidence submission. 

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 decision, as well as any evidence submitted during the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301 and?20.302.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.900 (c). 

1. A disability rating of 100 percent for major depressive disorder with anxiety from A, 2020 is granted.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in?38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity due to service-connected disability, and separate DCs identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.?38 U.S.C. § 1155;?38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

If the criteria and the facts are such that two different ratings are potentially applicable to the disability in question, the lower of those ratings must be assigned unless the veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

When determining the appropriate disability rating to assign, the Board must consider the Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment. Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the listed symptoms are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating-rather, the Board must find the symptoms and impairments the Veteran is experiencing as a result of the disability in question are of a comparable level of severity. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442-43 (2006) (holding that symptoms listed are not an "exhaustive list," but rather "examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating," and so the Board should consider all symptoms of a veteran's disability when assessing severity of impairment) and Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (a veteran may qualify for a given rating "by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration.").

All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran.?38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  See also, Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to a 100 percent rating for her service-connected depression.  The rating criteria relevant to this appeal, DC 9434, provide compensation for major depressive disorder under the General Formula for Rating Mental Disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

Under that code, a 70 percent rating is assigned when there is occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130 

In contrast, a 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximate a 100 percent impairment.

In the September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ summarily determined that the Veteran's depression did not manifest in any of the symptoms that reflect a 100% disabling impairment, and that because there is a likelihood of improvement, denied the increased rating. See September 2021 rating decision.

These findings are not consistent with the findings of a private examination the Veteran underwent in December 2000. During that examination, the Veteran reported that she experiences severely depressed mood most days and anxiety on a level that makes her not want to get out of bed and apathetic about any activity, including attending to important household matters, phone calls and emails. She has severe anxiety, panic attacks bi-weekly and is suspicious that others are planning against her, leading her to self-isolate. She is unable to communicate feelings and, due to her inability to focus, cannot convey basic important information. Stress magnifies these limitations, impairing her judgment and thought processes. Given the frequency and severity of the depression, anxiety and panic attacks in particular, the Veteran cannot complete a full shift at a workplace and has been unable to go to work for weeks at a time. See December 2000 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided.

The limitations noted in the December 2000 examination are consistent with the Veteran's testimony during the April 2025 hearing describing her symptoms and their impact on her ability to function. Furthermore, the Veteran's demeanor and comportment were on display for more than an hour during the hearing, and she gave the appearance of struggling with extreme anxiety and having difficulty coping with daily living activities. Additionally, the Veteran displayed a high level of personal strength, determination and resilience in attempting to manage her symptoms and continue being a productive person by working when she is able as a freelance ad hoc artisan. The fact that a person making such an obvious effort to overcome her impairment has been unable to do so is indicative of the true severity of her disability. 

After a holistic review of all the evidence, particularly the private DBQ, the Veteran's own reports of her ongoing symptoms, and her presentation during the hearing, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine applies to the factual question of whether the Veteran's symptoms qualify for a 100% rating.

As for the effective date of the increase, the Board notes the March 2021 Rating Decision awarding the increase to 70 percent determined December 10, 2020, was the correct date based on the date of the private DBQ revealing the increase in the severity of her symptoms and impairments. However, this ignores the rules governing effective dates for increased ratings. 

Specifically, the VA provides a one-year "grace period" for veterans to file a claim for an increased rating-that is, if the veteran files a claim within the one-year window after an increase in the severity of their disability becomes evident, the effective date of the increased rating will be the date the increase in severity became "factually ascertainable."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  See also, Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet.App. 219, 224 (2015) ("the effective date for...staged ratings[] is predicated on when the increase in the level of [disability] can be ascertained."); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet.App. 28, 35 (2000) (holding that the date of manifestation, not the date the evidence is submitted or received, is what is relevant when considering the effective date of an award).

Here, the DBQ in question specifically references April 2020 as when the Veteran's condition reached the point she could no longer continue working. This closely corresponds to the Veteran's VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability that says she last worked May 1, 2020. The Board finds this is evidence of a factually ascertainable increase in the severity of her depression at some point in April 2020. Because the specific date is not clear, the Board finds April 1, 2020, is the appropriate date to affix to the increase.

Because this is less than one year before the Veteran's December 2020 claim, the Board finds it is the correct effective date for the increase. Therefore, a 100 percent rating effective April 1, 2020 is warranted, and to that extent, this appeal is granted.
