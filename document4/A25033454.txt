ORDER

Entitlement to additional benefits based on parental dependency for the Veteran's mother, O.J., is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. O.J. is the biological mother of the Veteran.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record indicates that while O.J.'s income exceeds $400 per month, she does not have sufficient income to provide herself reasonable maintenance. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for additional compensation based upon recognition of the Veteran's biological mother, O.J., as his dependent parent for VA purposes are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 102, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.59, 3.250, 3.262, 3.263.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to July 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating action of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to additional benefits based on parental dependency for the Veteran's mother.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to additional dependency benefits based on recognition of his mother, O.J., as his dependent parent under 38 C.F.R. § 3.250.

A veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115. The Veteran in this case has been in receipt of a disability rating of at least 30 percent throughout the period on appeal.

The term "parent" means a natural mother or father (including the mother of an illegitimate child or the father of an illegitimate child if the usual family relationship existed), mother or father through adoption, or a person who for a period of not less than one year stood in the relationship of a parent to a veteran at any time before his or her entry into active service. 38 U.S.C. § 101(5); 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.59(a).

After a careful review of the record, the Board finds that recognition of O.J. as the Veteran's dependent parent for VA purposes is warranted. In this case, the evidence reflects that O.J. is the Veteran's biological mother. The Veteran's certificate of birth lists O.J. as the biological mother of the Veteran. See September 2023 Birth Certificate.

Accordingly, the Board finds that O.J. is recognized as Veteran's biological mother for the purpose of establishing entitlement to additional dependency compensation.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.250 govern whether a parent can be classified as a dependent parent. This regulation provides that conclusive dependency of a parent (other than one who is residing in a foreign country) will be held to exist where the monthly income does not exceed, in pertinent part, $400 (US dollars) for a mother or father not living together. 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(a)(1).

Further, where the income exceeds the monthly amounts stated in 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.250(a)(1), dependency will be determined on the facts in the individual case under the principles outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b).

If a veteran's parent's income is found to exceed the monthly amounts stated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(a)(1), dependency will be determined on the facts of the case pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b). Dependency of a parent will be held to exist if the parent does not have an income sufficient to provide for her reasonable maintenance. "Reasonable maintenance" includes housing, food, clothing, medical care, as well as items beyond the bare necessities. "Reasonable maintenance" also includes other requirements reasonably necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living suitable to and consistent with the parent's reasonable mode of life.

Retirement benefits, including an annuity or endowment, paid under a Federal, State, municipal, or private business or industrial plan are considered income. Where the payments received consist of part principal and part interest, interest will not be counted separately. In determining dependency of a parent for compensation purposes, all payments will be considered income as received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.262(e). Old age and survivor's insurance and disability insurance under Title II of the Social Security Act will be considered income as a retirement benefit under the rules as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.262(e).

Turning to the evidence, the Board first finds that O.J.'s income exceeded $400 per month during the claim period. Specifically, the Veteran reported in a VA Form 21-509, Statement of Dependency of Parents, that O.J. receives $896.00 per month in income from Social Security, which exceeds the $400 limit in 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.250(a)(1)(ii). See May 2023 VA Form 21-509. As such, entitlement to conclusive dependency is not warranted in this case and the only avenue to add the Veteran's mother as a dependent parent to his compensation award would be pursuant to the "basic rule" described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b).

The Veteran indicated the following monthly expenses for his mother: $600.00 per month for rent; $100.00 per month for utilities; $100 for medical needs; $100 per month for groceries; and $96.00 per month for personal needs. See May 2023 VA Form 21-509. She did not own property. Based on the information provided, O.J.'s total reported expenses of $996 exceeds her monthly income of $896 by $100. Further, the Veteran indicated that he paid further additional expenses for his mother as her needs exceeded her income.

In light of the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that O.J. does not have sufficient income to provide reasonable maintenance for herself. Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to recognition of O.J. as the Veteran's dependent parent for purposes of entitlement to additional benefits based on parental dependency is warranted pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b). As such, the appeal is granted.
