REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1982 to May 1989.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in August 2024 by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Notably, the August 2024 rating decision was a higher-level review of a rating decision issued in April 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a knee disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case.  Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until the end of the period in which to request a docket change, i.e., one-year from notification of the August 2024 rating decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

Although the Board regrets the delay, upon review of the claims file, the Board believes that remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error in failing to provide an adequate examination prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The law provides that VA shall make reasonable efforts to notify a claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim and requires the VA to assist a claimant in obtaining that evidence.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Such assistance includes providing the claimant a medical examination or obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Moreover, when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

In this case, the Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral knee arthritis pain as secondary to his service-connected back condition.  See December 2023 VA Form 21-4138; December 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim application.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024.  The VA examiner diagnosed degenerative arthritis of both knees.  The examiner opined the Veteran's degenerative knee arthritis is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of his service connected disabilities - lumbosacral strain, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  As to rationale, the examiner noted the Veteran's history of knee arthritis "is confirmed during today's exam and is a result of wear and tear over time," opining that a thorough review of literature "does not support a causal relationship between a lumbosacral strain with radiculopathy resulting in knee arthritis."  However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's bilateral knee arthritis is caused or aggravated by his service connected disabilities as the examiner did not address aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023); El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). 

Accordingly, on remand, addendum opinions must be obtained.  The Board also notes that the Veteran, through his representative, also requests remand of this appeal for a new VA medical examination/opinion for similar reasons noted.  See Appellate Brief, 09/17/2024.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right and/or left knee arthritis is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to and/or aggravated by his service connected lumbosacral strain with radiculopathy.

The examiner is reminded that "aggravation" does not require a permanent worsening of the condition; rather, it is any incremental increase in a disability attributable to the service-connected disability.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all proffered opinions. If the requested opinions cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why speculation is required.

In formation of the opinion, the examiner should consider the Veteran's contentions that his service-connected back issues altered his gait for years and resulted in additional pain and walking difficulties. See, e.g., December 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.
