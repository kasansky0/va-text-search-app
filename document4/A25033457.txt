ORDER

1. The appeal challenging the propriety of the reduction in the rating for the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, from 10 percent to 0 percent, from April 1, 2024, is granted; restoration of a 10 percent rating from the effective date of the reduction is granted.

2. The appeal challenging the propriety of the reduction in the rating for the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve, from 10 percent to 0 percent, from April 1, 2024, is granted; restoration of a 10 percent rating from the effective date of the reduction is granted.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent, for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy, is denied.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent, for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The reduction of the rating for the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve was based on two examinations, suggesting some improvement from when the disabilities were initially rated; it is not shown that the improvements reflect improvement in ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work.

2. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy are not shown to have been manifested in moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerves.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The reduction of the rating for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve from 10 percent to 0 percent was not in compliance with regulatory provisions governing such actions and was not proper; restoration of a 10 percent rating from the date of reduction is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (Code) 8520.

2. The reduction of the rating for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve from 10 percent to 0 percent was not in compliance with regulatory provisions governing such actions and was not proper; restoration of a 10 percent rating from the date of reduction is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.3, 4.124a, Code 8520.

3. A rating in excess of 10 percent for the left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.1, 4.7, 4.124, 4.124a, Code 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1997 to March 2001. 

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a January 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision (which reduced the ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective April 1, 2024) and a March 2024 rating decision (which, in notable part, continued the noncompensable ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves). The Veteran timely appealed these rating decisions as they related to the ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves to the Board and requested the Board direct review lane option. 

Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the January 5, 2024 rating decision (as related to the propriety of the reduced ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy) and at the time of the March 7, 2024 rating decision (as related to whether increased ratings for right and left extremity radiculopathy are warranted).

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the claims of the propriety of the reduced ratings and whether increased ratings are warranted, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Propriety of Reductions

1. Restoration of a 10 percent rating for the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is granted.

2. Restoration of a 10 percent rating for the right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is granted.

As a general rule, when the rating for a service-connected disability is reduced, VA must abide by specific procedural protections that apply. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). 

Where a reduction in an evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance must be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons, and the Regional Office (RO) must notify the veteran that he has 60 days to present additional evidence showing that compensation should be continued at the present level. If no additional evidence is received within the 60-day period and no hearing is requested, final rating action will be taken, and the award will be reduced or discontinued effective the last day of the month in which the 60-day period from the date of notice to the veteran expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). 

Here, the rating reduction of the ratings for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves did not violate the due process provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) because a July 2023 rating decision (with July 2023 VA notification letter) proposed that the ratings for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves be reduced to 0 percent, each; the July 28, 2023 notification letter also advised him that he had 60 days to submit additional evidence or request an RO predetermination hearing.

On August 1, 2023, VA received an invalid VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review, where he argued that his bilateral lower extremity disability has gotten worse. 

While VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ on October 23, 2023, seeking in part an increased rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves, he did not request a predetermination hearing before the RO. Accordingly, the January 2024 rating decision implemented the reduction of the rating to 10 percent each for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves, effective April 1, 2024 (prospectively). 

A January  2021 rating decision awarded an initial 10 percent rating for both left and right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves under Code 8520, both effective February 28, 2020. Since the 10 percent ratings for the lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves were in effect for less than 5 years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 do not apply. Accordingly, the analysis proceeds to whether the reduction was warranted by the factual record. 

The critical question in this matter is whether the rating reduction was warranting by a showing of improvement of the service-connected disability. VA regulations require that each disability be viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 establish that it is the responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 4.13 provides that the rating agency should assure itself that there has been an actual change in the condition, for better or worse, and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in use of descriptive terms. 

In any rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but that such improvement reflects improvement in ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work. See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-421 (1993). Further, a rating reduction must be supported by evidence on file at the time of the reduction, although pertinent post-reduction evidence favorable to restoring the rating also must be considered. Dofflemeyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1992).

Under Code 8520, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis; a 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis; a 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy; and an (maximum) 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, where the foot dangles and drops, and there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened, or very rarely, lost. 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Code 8520.

The terms "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

A May 2023 VA treatment record notes complaints of numbness, tingling, burning of both legs and bilateral leg weakness with symptoms manifesting as fatigued muscles. 

In a June 2023 VA back examination, lumbar radiculopathy was not diagnosed. The examiner stated the 2019 reference to "lumbar; radiculopathy, left lower extremity, sciatic nerve; radiculopathy, right lower extremity, sciatic nerve" had no explanation of how this was supported anatomically and/or neuroanatomically. The examiner opined that "clinical differentiation and/or apportionment of what structural change contributes to his reported symptoms without making arbitrary distinctions, fictional characterizations, devoid of any anatomical, neuroanatomical and/or clinical/scientific foundation and entirely speculative." While the examiner stated that the Veteran had not "voiced symptoms and/or physical and neurological exam findings" of radiculopathy in the examination, Veteran reported his pain was getting worse and that he sometimes gets sciatica.

Muscle strength was normal (5/5), reflex testing was normal (2+), sensory testing was normal, and there was no muscle atrophy. Straight leg testing was negative in both limbs. There were no signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy and there was no involvement of the sciatic nerves.

An August 2023 VA acupuncture treatment record notes the Veteran reported bilateral sciatica pain. In an August 2023 Request for higher level review, the Veteran argued that his sciatic pain still existed and is worse on both sides. 

In an October 2023 VA back examination, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve was diagnosed. The Veteran reported experiencing worsening sciatica with the right side worse than the left. Muscle strength was normal (5/5), reflex testing was normal (2+), sensory testing was normal, and there was no muscle atrophy. Straight leg testing was positive in both limbs. The symptoms of bilateral lower extremity nerve radiculopathy were noted to be moderate intermittent pain. There was no constant pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, or numbness in either lower extremity. The examiner noted the bilateral sciatic nerves were involved.

Upon longitudinal review of the record, the Board finds that the reductions in the ratings for the right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves from 10 percent to 0 percent was improper because the June 2023 and October 2023 VA examinations (on which the reductions were based) did not demonstrate improvement that reflects an improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work and appears to be based on a difference in the thoroughness of the examination. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). While the Veteran reported sciatic pain at the June 2023 VA examination, the examiner appeared to dismiss such complaints as there was a lack of objective medical evidence of radiculopathy at the time of the examination. Notably, the Veteran reported sciatic pain to his treating provider prior to the June 2023 VA examination as well as after the VA examinations. In addition, the October 2023 VA examiner observed signs and symptoms of intermittent radicular pain in both lower extremities. While the Veteran exhibited slight improvement at the 2023 VA examinations, such examinations did not demonstrate an improvement that actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

Therefore, the Board finds that the reductions in the ratings for his right and left lower extremity radiculopathy from 10 to 0 percent was improper. Restoration of a 10 percent rating for both right and left lower extremity radiculopathy from the effective date of the reductions are warranted.

Increased Ratings

3. An increased rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is denied.

4. An increased rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is denied.

As the 10 percent ratings for the right and left lower extremity radiculopathy are restored herein, remaining for consideration is whether a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted for either his left or right lower extremity radiculopathy.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of rating, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Separate ratings for distinct periods when varying degrees of disability were shown can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be assigned, the higher criteria will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

To avoid repetition, the Board will not repeat the majority medical evidence of record for this case for the sake of brevity as the period on appeal overlaps with the medical evidence of record related to the propriety of the rating reductions, addressed above.

The Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves are each rated 10 percent. The next higher rating (20 percent under Code 8520) requires moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The record does not show impairments of such severity. 

On the June 2023 and October 2023 VA examinations, the Veteran's muscle strength, reflex, and sensory testing were normal; only moderate intermittent pain was noted as a sign or symptom of radiculopathy on the October 2023 VA examination. Such objective examination findings weigh against a finding of more than mild incomplete bilateral lower extremity nerve paralysis, which is currently awarded. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's own reports at the October 2023 VA examination of moderate intermittent pain as well his occasional reports to treating providers of pain, numbness, and tingling. Such complaints are consistent with the criteria for the 10 percent rating criteria and do not support that there is more than mild incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic nerves (so as to warrant ratings in excess of 10 percent for left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124A.

Consequently, the evidence is persuasively against the claims. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply; the appeals seeking a rating in excess of 10 percent, each, for left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy must be denied.
