ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shin splints is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has bilateral shin splints, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The Veteran does not have hearing loss for VA purposes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral shin splints have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 106, 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 2012 to May 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from December 2023 and April 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, the Board has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from injury or disease that was incurred in, or aggravated by, military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after a veteran's discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377.

The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible or worthy of belief. Barr, supra. Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination about the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno, supra. 

The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence considering the entirety of the record. In this regard, the Board may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, bias, self-interest, internal consistency, and consistency with other evidence of record submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995); Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 355 (2016).

Therefore, in rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral shin splints is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral shin splints that are the result of his military service. July 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997). The current disability requirement is satisfied when a claimant "has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim," McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); or "when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to... filing a claim for benefits based on that disability." Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

A careful and thorough review of the Veteran's post-service medical records reflect that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of any shin splint conditions, nor did he have any such diagnosis at any time during the period on appeal. There is also no evidence of record that reflects complaints or treatment of symptoms related to any shin condition. An August 2023 VA knee and lower leg examination did not show any shin condition. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that he has such condition. Nevertheless, while he is competent to report the observable physical symptoms of these disabilities, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis or medical opinion. See Barr, supra. These issues are medically complex and require specialized medical education and knowledge of the interaction between multiple systems in the body as well as the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4; 38 U.S.C. § 1110. 

In denying the Veteran's claim, the Board acknowledges that no medical opinion was obtained regarding the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral shin splints. However, the Veteran has not provided evidence that he has a diagnosis of any shin condition. Accordingly, the Board finds that an additional VA examination and opinion are not necessary to decide the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Therefore, as there are no current diagnoses of any shin condition at any time during the pendency of the appeal, the medical evidence does not support service connection for the claim and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.

Finally, the Board recognizes in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity." In this instance, the Board finds the weight of both the medical and lay evidence is against a finding the Veteran's shin pain causes functional impairment.  The Veteran has not presented any evidence, including his statements, that his pain has resulted in diminished function or impairment of earning capacity.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has hearing loss as a result of his military service. July 2024 VA Form 10182.

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain enumerated chronic disabilities (to include sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus as organic diseases of the nervous system) if manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year of discharge from active service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (the term "chronic disease" refers to chronic diseases enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a)). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id. There is no nexus requirement for these disabilities so long as there is an absence of an intercurrent cause. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39. 

Chronic diseases may also be service connected based on a theory of continuity of symptomatology under § 3.303(b). Hearing loss is a "chronic disease" listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) as other organic disease of the nervous system. Therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) apply. Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination in November 2023. The VA examiner reported pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

 	HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20	15	15	25	30

LEFT	15	15	20	30	30

							

The VA examiner also reported speech discrimination scores of 100 percent for both ears. 

Based upon this testing, no frequency between 500-4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater, the auditory thresholds for at least three frequencies between 500-4000 Hertz are not 26 decibels or greater, and the speech discrimination scores are not less than 94 percent. As such, the Veteran does not have hearing loss for VA purposes.

The Board finds that a current hearing loss disability has not been demonstrated. There is no medical evidence in the file, either service or civilian, that the Veteran has been diagnosed with any type of hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As a hearing loss disability requires specific testing, the Veteran's lay statements of record are not sufficient to establish a hearing loss disability. Absent sufficient evidence of hearing loss for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the first element of service connection has not been established with regard to the hearing loss claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (holding that in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim).

The Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim and does not show that the Veteran has hearing loss for VA purposes. Therefore, as the evidence is not at least in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
