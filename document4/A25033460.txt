REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1999 to July 2001.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran presented sworn testimony at a hearing before the undersigned in April 2025. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on April 3, 2025

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran during the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). The Veteran expressly and affirmatively waived the 90-day post-hearing evidence submission period.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's disease is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's. Specifically, the Veteran claims that he was exposed to jet fuel while working as a tactical aircraft maintenance apprentice during his service which thereafter caused his Parkinson's. 

The Board finds that service connection for Parkinson's is warranted. The March 2024 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The Veteran reported the onset of his left pinky started to twitch, he thereafter developed hypertension in 2003 with noted weakness to arm muscles. In 2005 he was diagnosed with dysphagia and abnormal movement disorder. The Veteran was not diagnosed with Parkinson's until July 2023 where he was seen in the Emergency Room for slurred speech, fatigue, and voice changes. 

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and recurrence of his symptoms, and the Board finds his testimony to be credible. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). 

The Veteran submitted a private nexus letter from neurologist Dr. A. D., who opined that the Veteran's exposure to hydrocarbons was the likely cause of the Veteran's Parkinson's disease. The letter discussed supporting literature and the Veteran's exposure to hydrocarbons in the form of JP-8 fuel during his military career. See Atrium Health Correspondence dated October 6, 2023, identified in the claim file as "Photographs - Veteran Provided." 

The Board finds the examiner's opinion highly probative as it contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). "The probative value of evidence is its tendency to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove. Evidence has probative value if it tends to prove the issue in dispute." McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 254 (2019) (quoting Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); United States v. Welsh, 774 F.2d 670, 672 (4th Cir. 1985)).

Thus, all three elements necessary to establish service connection have been met. See 38 C.F.R. §?3.303. The Board notes the negative nexus opinion of record; however, the opinion did not address the onset of the Veteran's diagnosis of Parkinson's or whether it was related to the exposure of jet fuel he had in service. Instead, the examiner provided a negative opinion with an inadequate reasoning stating, "in order to render a secondary opinion a service-connected condition must exist and in this case a service-connected condition of Parkinson's disease does not exist." See March 13, 2024, Medical Opinion- Disability Benefits Questionnaire. This is, essentially, a tautology rather than a conclusion based on evidence, and, as a result of Dr. A.D.'s opinion, it is no longer relevant or instructive.

Here, the evidence shows that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease was caused by in service exposure to jet fuel, therefore, service connection is warranted. Concluding, entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's is granted. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for depression, anxiety, and insomnia as secondary to his now, from this decision, service-connected Parkinson's disease. See August 24, 2023, Fully Developed Claim. When a Veteran files a claim for a mental health disorder, the claim includes any mental health disorder that may be reasonably encompassed by the Veteran's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and other information of record. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). Therefore, since the Veteran's mental disorder has been characterized under more than one diagnosis, the Board will recharacterize his claim as an acquired psychiatric disorder as secondary to Parkinson's disease.

The Board finds service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected Parkinson's.

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability resulting from a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability results from the service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that section 1110 "requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability"). The but-for causation standard in a secondary service-connected case is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links, including action and inaction. Id.

Looking at the evidence of record, it is established that the Veteran has been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression. Thus, the first requirement for a finding that a current disability exists, has been met. Now, the Board must determine, based on the evidence available, whether the Veteran's diagnosed conditions were caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected Parkinson's disease.

In September 2023, an in-person examination and review of the Veteran's records was conducted by a VA examiner. In the report, the VA medical examiner noted the Veteran's depressive disorder diagnosis was due to a known medical condition of Parkinson's. 

Additionally, the VA examiner noted that according to the medical doctor who diagnosed the Veteran with Parkinson's the Veteran's Parkinson's disease causes moderate sleep disturbances, moderate depression, and cognitive impairment. The examiner also marked depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short- and long-term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances as symptoms the Veteran experienced from his diagnosed general anxiety disorder and depression. 

Further in support of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection he submitted a Statement in Support of Claim in October 2023 wherein he details multiple secondary symptoms due to having Parkinson's disease to include, but not limited to, depression, anxiety, and fatigue. The Veteran described the secondary symptoms were determined to be due to Parkinson's after his appointment with a Neurologist. The Veteran is competent to report the onset and recurrence of his symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Board may not deem lay evidence categorically incompetent. King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Furthermore, Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Veteran was competently reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis of secondary symptoms he was noted in having due to Parkinson's disease and as documented by a Neurologist. 

The Veteran also submitted a private Parkinson's disease disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ). The medical doctor documented moderate depression and anxiety. See September 25, 2023, DBQ.

As such, the evidence of record on the issue of whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric condition show that it is caused and aggravated by his service-connected Parkinson's disease. Thus, the second requirement for a finding of service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, as secondary to Parkinson's disease, has been met.

The Board notes the negative nexus opinions of record; however, the opinions did not address the onset of the Veteran's diagnosis of Parkinson's or whether it was related to the Veteran's depression or anxiety. Instead, the opinion provided a negative opinion as it relates to whether the Veteran's diagnosed depression and anxiety were incurred in or caused by trouble sleep during service. See April 4, 2024, Medical Opinion- Disability Benefits Questionnaire. 

Here, the evidence shows at a minimum the Veteran's depression and anxiety were caused by his service-connected Parkinson's disease, therefore, service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition is warranted. Concluding, entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for cognitive issues and executive functioning as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted.

4. Entitlement to service connection for left hand tremors as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted.

5. Entitlement to service connection for tingling in feet as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet as secondary to his now, from this decision, service-connected Parkinson's disease. See August 24, 2023, Fully Developed Claim. The Board finds service connection is warranted for cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected Parkinson's.

Again, the Board notes service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a claimed disability if a service-connected disease or injury is a substantially contributing cause of the claimed disability. 

Looking at the evidence of record, it is established that the Veteran has symptoms of cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet. Thus, the first requirement for a finding that a current disability exists, has been met. Now, the Board must determine, based on the evidence available, whether the Veteran's diagnosed conditions were caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected Parkinson's disease.

In August 2024, a Neurology Clinic Note documented Parkinson's symptoms of tremors intermittent, balance problem, fatigue swelling of hands, muscle spasm, increase sweating, whisper voice, swallowing difficulty, erectile dysfunction issues, slow body movements. The Veteran also had noted cognitive issues of short-term memory issues, forgetful with appointments, conversation, misplace things and not recall, drives and misses exits, and forgets to make turns despite using GPS. The Veteran also had noted migraines, left thigh - anterior thigh numbness, and cognitive impairment with early dementia. 

The Veteran also submitted in November 2023 a private Parkinson's Disease DBQ which documented mild stooped posture, balance impairment, and bradykinesia or slowed motion. The Veteran had noted tremors and muscle rigidity and stiffness on his left upper extremity. The Veteran also had moderate depression and cognitive impairment or dementia. Additional complications noted were moderate sleep disturbance and difficulty chewing/swallowing, mild constipation, and severe sexual dysfunction. Under functional impact, executive dysfunction, spatial recognition, communication, urinary, and anxiety were also noted. 

Moreover, the Board again notes the Statement in Support of Claim received in October 2023 wherein the Veteran details multiple secondary symptoms due to having Parkinson's disease to include, but not limited to, muscle cramps, fatigue, loss of visuospatial function, and loss of executive function. The Veteran described the secondary symptoms were determined to be due to Parkinson's after his appointment with a Neurologist. The Veteran is competent to report the onset and recurrence of his symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Board may not deem lay evidence categorically incompetent. King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Furthermore, Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Veteran was competently reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis of secondary symptoms he was noted in having due to Parkinson's disease and as documented by a Neurologist. 

Additionally, during his hearing testimony, the Veteran verified multiple times his providers have expressly attributed each of these claimed disabilities as arising from his Parkinson's disease.

As such, the evidence of record on the issues of whether the Veteran's cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet show that they are caused and aggravated by his service-connected Parkinson's disease. Thus, the second requirement for a finding of service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, as secondary to Parkinson's disease, has been met.

The Board notes the negative nexus opinion of record; however, the opinion did not address the onset of the Veteran's diagnosis of Parkinson's or whether it was related to the Veteran's cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet. Instead, the opinion provided a negative opinion solely based upon Parkinson's not yet having been found to be service connected. 

Here, the evidence shows at a minimum the Veteran's cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet were caused by his service-connected Parkinson's disease, therefore, service connection for cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet is warranted. Concluding, entitlement to service connection for a cognitive issues and executive functioning; left hand tremors; and tingling in feet as secondary to Parkinson's disease is granted. 

The Board observes it frequently is difficult to determine whether a claimed disability should be rated on its own or treated as a symptom or component of the primary disability. The Board notes the law does not preclude providing separate evaluations under multiple diagnostic codes for different manifestations of a single disease or injury.  See Walleman v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 294 (2022). 

Thus, given the nature of the Veteran's claim, the AOJ rating decision, and the Veteran's appeal, the Board has determined to the extent these disabilities would better be addressed as symptoms of Parkinson's disease, thereby potentially implicating the 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibition on "pyramiding" disabilities, is best treated as a downstream rating issue when the Board is resolving questions of service connection. See Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993) (pyramiding is improper when it results in overcompensation); Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (disability rating and effective date are issues separate from service connection).

6. Entitlement to Sleep Apnea Syndromes (sleep apnea) as secondary to acquired psychiatric disorder is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran underwent a sleep study in September 2023. See March 2024, Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire. The study is not included in the claims file, nor was the Veteran asked to complete a VA Form 21-4142 to allow VA to obtain these records in support of the Veteran's claim. Failure to attempt to obtain the record is a pre-decisional duty to assist error warranting remand. 

The Board will not remand an appeal, however, when the evidence as it stands is sufficient to resolve the ultimate issue before the Board, even if a remand could provide greater clarity or certainty, because to do so would not only unquestionably prolong the adjudication process, but it may also arguably run afoul of the prohibition on remanding an appeal in order to obtain evidence against the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c). Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021).  See also, Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (acknowledging a veteran's interests are often better served by providing an immediate and final resolution of their claims versus remanding to cure errors not necessarily affecting the final resolution).

When evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence to decide the appeal, the Board is sensitive to the need to "stay in its lane," so to speak, and avoid invading the province of scientific or medical experts by exercising independent judgment on matters requiring specialized knowledge. See, e.g., Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991). Accordingly, the Board eschews engaging in medical diagnosis. The existence of service connection for a given disability is not a medical diagnosis, however-it is a question of fact. See, e.g., Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 191 (1991). 

Though the Board carefully considers input from medical professionals and other experts when deciding questions of fact, it does not "outsource" to them its role as the finder of fact.; See, e.g., Sizemore v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 264 (2004); Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 242 (2019); Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 259 (2020). As a result, when the question of whether a disability is service-connected is on appeal, providing the ultimate answer is the exclusive province of the Board. See, e.g., Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). 

When making factual findings, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  

Specifically, the Board gives veterans the benefit of the doubt on any material issue when the positive and negative evidence concerning that issue are approximately balanced or nearly equal.  38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, unless the totality of the evidence persuasively weighs against them, the Board finds in favor of the veteran.  Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364-1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-1379 (2023).

Here, there is ample evidence in the record that the Veteran has sleep apnea. See, e.g., September 2023 Community Care-Consult Result Note listing sleep apnea among diagnosed conditions.

As to the cause of the Veteran's sleep apnea, the Veteran testified his providers have told him it is related to Parkinson's disease. The Board finds this is plausible, but it is more likely the result of his acquired psychiatric disorder and the medications prescribed for it, including vilazodone, known to cause sleep disturbances. Notably, the Veteran's medical records indicate he was prescribed both vilazodone to treat his depression and zolpidem (also known as Ambien) to overcome the side effects of vilazodone and induce sleep. See, e.g., October 2023 Medication Reconciliation Note.

The Board finds this is sufficient to trigger the benefit of the doubt doctrine and support a finding in favor of the Veteran.  Secondary service connection for sleep apnea is warranted. This appeal is granted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
