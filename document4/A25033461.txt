REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1996 to June 1996 and from September 1998 to November 2004. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued October 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA is remanded.

The Veteran generally asserts that his diagnosis of OSA was caused by his active duty service. See April 2023 VA Form 526-EZ.

The Veteran participated in a toxic risk exposure activity (TERA). His military personnel record confirms that he served in Kuwait from July 2003 through January 2004. See December 2022 VA Memorandum. 

He is currently diagnosed with OSA.  See April 13, 2023 Private Medical Treatment Record.

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). In July 2023, a VA examiner provided negative nexus opinion for the Veteran's OSA, finding that it was not caused by his TERA, stating that, "Sleep apnea is caused by upper airway obstruction. Toxic exposure does not cause sleep apnea." However, this opinion is inadequate because the examiner did not provide a rationale to support this conclusion.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim without obtaining an addendum to address the above-noted deficiencies in the July VA 2023 nexus opinion. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. A remand is necessary to correct it.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's OSA. After reviewing the claims file, the examiner is asked to address the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness?  Please explain why or why not, specifically considering and discussing the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure throughout his military service and the synergistic, combined effect of all the Veteran's TERAs.  

Please include a complete rationale for the opinion provided.  If you cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why it is so.
