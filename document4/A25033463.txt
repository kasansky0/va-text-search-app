DOCKET NO. 240914-474241
DATE:  April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), from July 13, 2022, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of a combined rating of at least 70 percent, with disabilities combinable to 40 percent or higher, and the combined service-connected disabilities have precluded his substantial and gainful employment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an award of TDIU on a schedular basis from July 13, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a) (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1990 to May 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision, which followed the Veteran's supplemental claim for TDIU, filed in March 2023. See August 2022, Rating Decision (granting service connection for disabilities related to the cervical spine); March 2023 VA Form 21-8940 and 21-526EZ; see also Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims 336. In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision, which found that a duty-to-assist (DTA) error had occurred during the previous adjudication of the claim at hand. Following additional development, the August 2024 rating decision was issued. 

In the September 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024, AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that the time for filing a request to change the elected AMA docket has not yet elapsed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, in filing the September 2024 NOD, the Veteran also submitted a thorough appellate brief that included argument and consideration of the evidence of record, reiterating their election of the Direct Review Docket, and seeking specific appellate relief. Considering the argument presented, along with the favorable findings outlined herein which allow for the benefit sought (entitlement to TDIU) to be granted in full, the Board finds that any procedural error in proceeding with a decision at this time is harmless and non-prejudicial to the Veteran. 

Entitlement to a TDIU 

The Veteran asserts that he has been unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. 

As of July 13, 2022, the schedular criteria for a TDIU rating, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), have been met. As of that date, the Veteran is service-connected for the following disabilities and corresponding disability ratings: bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy, each side rated at 20 percent; degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the cervical spine with intervertebral disc syndrome and spondylosis (hereafter, "cervical spine disability"), 20 percent; patellofemoral stress syndrome with secondary degenerative arthritis of the left knee (hereafter, "left knee disability"), 10 percent; impairment of the right knee with limitation of flexion (hereafter, "right knee disability"), 10 percent; tinnitus, 10 percent; and residual scar of the cervical spine, 0 percent . The combined disability rating for the aforenoted disabilities is 70 percent. 

The Board finds that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1), the ratings assigned for the bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy disabilities, including the bilateral factor, combine to meet the 40 percent requirement for one disability, with additional disabilities combined therewith bringing the overall total rating to 70 percent. Thus, the schedular criteria for a TDIU have been met. 

The Board also finds that the severity of the Veteran's disabilities, confirmed by the record through ongoing VA examinations and treatment notes, render the Veteran unable to work in positions involving prolonged physical activity or even engaging in physical work which requires standing, walking, lifting, bending, and carrying heavy objects; or work which requires extensive driving due to limited peripheral vision. See April 2023, VA Examination Reports. 

In the April 2023, VA examination related to the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities, it was reported that the Veteran experiences weekly flare-ups of increased pain which causes further limitations in range of motion. Such flare-ups typically occur after over-use of the knee joints. The examiner opined that the Veteran's knee disabilities cause difficulty with weight-bearing activity, including the simple act of standing, along with walking or lifting. Id.

The cervical spine and upper extremity radiculopathy disabilities were found to cause the Veteran limited range of motion in the neck, making it difficult to see peripheral images without turning the body. The April 2023 examiner further noted that driving would be problematic due to safety concerns with peripheral visibility as well as due to decreased grip strength in the right hand. Id.

The Board has also considered the Veteran's experience, training, and education in addition to the physical limitations presented by his service-connected disabilities. The record demonstrates that the Veteran worked as a mechanic from April 1999 to April 2022 and has been unemployed since leaving his career of 23 years. See March 2023, VA Form 21-8940. The Veteran also reports completing two years of college but otherwise not receiving any additional training or education beyond the training received as a mechanic. Id. 

During the informal conference before the AOJ in November 2023, it was again confirmed that the Veteran has no training or skill sets transferable to sedentary employment as his entire career consisted of physical employment as a mechanic. The Veteran also asserted that the only reason he left his position was because of the physical limitations he was experiencing due to his now-service-connected disabilities. See November 2023, Informal Conference Worksheet. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's VA treatment records also confirm the limitations presented by his service-connected disabilities. In February 2021, the Veteran underwent a cervical spine laminoplasty and foraminotomy. His records also depict historical knee procedures with reports of pain as limiting his physical activity outside of work. See 2020-2023, VA Treatment Records. 

Given the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence for and against a finding that the Veteran's combined service-connected disabilities have precluded him from obtaining and maintaining any form of substantially gainful employment, from July 13, 2022, is in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to a TDIU beginning July 13, 2022, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
