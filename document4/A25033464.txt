ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee meniscal tear is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for multiple sclerosis is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's left knee meniscal tear was incurred during active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left knee meniscal tear have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2008 to October 2011. These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Regarding multiple sclerosis, because the Board is remanding that claim any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran did not waive the remainder of his window to request a change of dockets pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Regarding the left knee, the current decision constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought. Regarding multiple sclerosis, the current decision is not a final determination on the benefit sought. For those reasons, the current lack of a waiver represents only harmless error by the Board.

Service connection 

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible. See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency, "a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered;" and credibility, "a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"). The Board is also charged with the duty to assess the probative weight given to all evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee meniscal tear is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his left knee disability was incurred during active service. After careful review of the evidence, the Board agrees. 

As above, the first required element of service connection is a current disability. See Shedden, supra. In the decision on appeal (August 2024), the RO conceded that the Veteran has a "confirm[ed] diagnosis of knee meniscal tear." See also C&P Exam, May 2024. The Board will not disturb that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Veteran has met the first element of service connection by establishing a current disability.

The second element is an in-service incurrence or aggravation of injury or disease. See Shedden, supra. In the decision on appeal (August 2024), the RO conceded that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) "show a complaint of left knee pain on October 5, 2011." The Board will not disturb that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Veteran has met the second element by establishing an in-service incurrence or aggravation.

The third and final element of service connection generally requires medical evidence showing a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service incurrence. See Shedden, supra. 

To determine the nature and cause of the Veteran's left knee disability, he was afforded a VA examination in October 2022. The examiner authored a negative opinion that cuts against a grant of service connection: 

"Based on review of the available evidence, it is less likely than not that the claimed condition is due to sharp pain during service as there is scant data supporting a   nexus between the current diagnosis of Left Knee Meniscal Tear repaired (2015) and military service."

In March 2023, the RO issued a VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return, finding that the examiner's "[r]ationale is inconsistent with the evidentiary record [and] therefore is insufficient for rating purposes." See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion obtains probative weight from "factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion"). The Board will not disturb that favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the examiner's negative opinion carries no probative weight for resolving the Veteran's knee claim.

The Veteran was afforded a second examination in May 2024 with a different examiner. Importantly, the examiner noted the Veteran's in-service report of left knee pain: 

"A Report of Medical History dated 10/05/2011 shows [V]eteran reporting intermittent left knee pain. A Report of Medical Assessment dated 10/05/2011 shows [V]eteran with pain in bilateral knees for the past 3.5 years, left worse than right, and shows [V]eteran never sought medical treatment."

However, the examiner authored a negative opinion that cuts against a grant of service connection:

"Veteran's medical records are then silent regarding any complaints of left knee pain until 2015, and it is clearly documented that [V]eteran's left knee pain in March 2015 started 3-5 months prior (several years after separation). Furthermore, [V]eteran's left knee McMurray test on 10/05/2011 was negative for evidence of a meniscal tear or injury. There is no medical nexus to support a link between [V]eteran's reported left knee pain on 10/05/2011 to the currently diagnosed left knee meniscal tear. [] Therefore, [V]eteran's medical records support that the currently diagnosed left knee meniscal tear, related to the [V]eteran's claimed left knee meniscus tear, was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the in-service injury during service."

Upon review, the Veteran's VA treatment records include an internal medicine note from January 2014, where he treated for: "Knee issues: B/l, sometimes buckels [sic] & gives away. No pain chronically. Constnatly he has duck walked servicing the aircraft. Mild pain last[s] for 15 mins after bucking [sic] down. Happens [c]ouple of times a week." CAPRI Records, September 2022.

Because the 2024 examiner did not consider the Veteran's reports of knee pain in January 2014, the Board finds that the examiner's opinion carries no probative weight. C&P Exam, May 2024 ("Veteran's medical records are then silent regarding any complaints of left knee pain until 2015"): Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake.

As shown, the Veteran described ongoing symptoms of left knee pain in October 2011 during his separation examination. STR - Medical, October 2011. The Veteran reported "sharp pain at times in left knee[.] Have not been seen, pain is manageable by myself." From the examiner's summary: "Pain in Bilat knees L > R, x 3.5 years. Hit [left] knee on hatch, no swelling. [Increased] pain [with] squatting."  

As above, the Veteran treated for ongoing "Knee issues" in January 2014. CAPRI Records, September 2022. During that treatment, the Veteran attributed his knee pain with "duck walk[ing while] servicing the aircraft." Upon review, the Veteran served in the Navy as a maintenance technician for a fighter jet squadron. DD 214, October 2011. 

In March 2015, the Veteran returned for treatment of left knee pain. CAPRI Records, September 2022. During those treatments, the Veteran reported an onset of symptoms during the previous 3-5 months. See Telephone Encounter Note, March 10, 2015 ("Duration of Complaint: 3 Months"); Internal Medicine Attending Note, March 17, 2015 ("Left Knee Pain - started giving trouble for last 4-5 months"). However, a private orthopedic note from May 2015 shows the Veteran "describ[ing] pain within the left knee that has become progressively worse over the last 5 years." Medical Treatment Records - Nongovernment, May 2024. 

After considering the Veteran's 2015 treatment records, the Board finds that his reports of onset during the previous 3-5 months represents a report of worsening acute symptoms related to a persistent knee condition that began five years earlier-i.e., during active service. The Veteran's testimony regarding this timeline is highly credible because he made those statements approximately seven years before raising a claim for VA benefits. See Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999) (although the Board must take into consideration a claimant's statements, it may consider whether self-interest may be a factor in making such statements). 

Upon review, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report his ongoing knee pain, but he is not competent to diagnose himself with a meniscal tear. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1)-(2) (defining competent medical evidence and competent lay evidence); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002) (finding the claimant competent to testify to symptomatology capable of lay observation). Such opinions require specific medical training and are beyond the competency of a lay person, such as the Veteran. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Under certain circumstances, however, lay statements may be sufficient to support a claim by showing the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability, or symptoms of disability, that are capable of lay observation. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376; Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (finding that lay evidence is competent if provided by a person with knowledge of the facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed by a person without specialized knowledge or training). 

When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine on a case by case basis whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

A determination as to whether medical evidence is needed to demonstrate that a Veteran presently has the same condition he had in service or during a presumptive period, or whether lay evidence will suffice, depends on the nature of the Veteran's present condition (e.g., whether the Veteran's present condition is of a type that requires medical expertise to identify it as the same condition as that in service or during a presumption period, or whether it can be so identified by lay observation). See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310 (2007). Thus, medical evidence is not always or categorically required when the determinative issue involves either medical diagnosis or etiology, but rather such may, depending on the facts of the particular case, be established by competent and credible lay evidence under 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Here, the Board finds that knee pain is a symptom which the Veteran can assess by lay observation. Moreover, the Board finds that the Veteran has given credible symptom testimony that he has experienced knee pain since active service. As shown, the Veteran discussed those symptoms with medical care providers. See C&P Exam, October 2022 ("In May 2015 he had arthroscopic left knee surgery for meniscal tear"). As above, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of an onset of knee symptoms during active service are highly credible.

Therefore, the Board finds that (1) knee pain is a symptom which the Veteran is capable of assessing via lay testimony and (2) the Veteran's testimony is highly credible. By extension, the Board must conclude that the Veteran's meniscal tear is causally related to active duty service, which includes "duck walk[ing while] servicing the aircraft." Internal Medicine Note, January 2014.

Accordingly, the Board is resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor. See Lynch, supra. Therefore, service connection for a left knee meniscal tear must be granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran asserts that his multiple sclerosis should be service connected based on toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs) during active duty. 

In April 2024, VA received a Form 21-4142a, General Release for Medical Provider Information to the Department of Veterans Affairs. Therein, the Veteran described relevant treatment records from "Kaiser." He specified that these records were generated by "My MS neurologist office." He reported treatment at that office from August 13, 2020, to May 18, 2024. 

To the RO's credit, they pursued those private treatment records numerous times during the review period. See e.g. Report of General Information, April 2024; Medical Records Request, May 17, 2024; Report of General Information, July 2024. 

Upon review, however, those Kaiser records were never associated with the Veteran's file. 

On August 27, 2024, the RO issued a Report of General Information with the following statement: "PHP has been contacted several times to request PMR.  Closing out request as non-response." The Board notes that this statement of unavailability was not issued until nearly one month after the decision on appeal (August 2, 2024). 

Consequently, the Board must find that the Veteran's claim for multiple sclerosis was not yet ripe for adjudication. Moreover, the RO's failure to issue a statement of unavailability during the appeal period constitutes a pre-decisional due process error which must be corrected upon remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Issue a Memorandum of Formal Finding of Unavailability documenting the previous attempts to obtain private treatment records from the Veteran's neurologist at Kaiser Permanente from August 13, 2020, to May 18, 2024.
