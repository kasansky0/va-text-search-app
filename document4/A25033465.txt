Entitlement to service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress from February 10, 2021, but no earlier, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was denied entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and tinnitus in a September 2022 rating decision; New and relevant evidence, to include a COVID-19 impact statement, has been added to the record since the last prior denial.

2. The Veteran filed his claim with Board for Corrections of Naval Records (BCNR) on November 5, 2020; his previously disallowed claim seeking service connection for a depressive disorder and tinnitus was readjudicated February 10, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. New and relevant evidence has been added to the record since the prior final denial and the claims seeking entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for the grants of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and tinnitus may be readjudicated.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and tinnitus from February 10, 2021, but no earlier, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 5110, 7105;?38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1992 to February 1995.  He appeals a January 2023 rating decision denying entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for the grants of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and tinnitus.  

New and Relevant Evidence

Generally, a claim which has been denied in an unappealed Board decision or an unappealed AOJ decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(b), 7105(c).  VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). 

New evidence is defined as evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is defined as information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

Procedural History

The Veteran submitted an initial claim seeking entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and tinnitus in November 2018.  In an April 2019 decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. § chapter 17 due to an Other Than Honorable discharge from active service.  In April 2021, the Veteran submitted a discharge upgrade request to the BCNR.  He was granted a discharge upgrade in September 2021.  In January 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim seeking to reopen the service connection claims for compensation purposes.  In a February 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for compensation purposes for his psychiatric disorder and tinnitus, effective the date he filed his January 2022 claim.  The Veteran filed a May 2022 Supplemental Claim seeking earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection.  He was denied in a September 2022 rating decision.  After another Supplemental Claim in November 2022, the Veteran was denied reopening of the claim due to a failure to submit new and relevant evidence.  This appeal followed. 

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to reopen the previously denied claim seeking an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. 

2. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to reopen the previously denied claim seeking an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for tinnitus.

The Appeals Modernization Act introduces the new standard of new and relevant evidence.  The statute defines relevant evidence as "evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue."  Pub. L. No. 115-55 § 2(a).  This is a change from the previous standard of material evidence, which required "evidence that... relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

As noted above, the claim seeking entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for depressive disorder and tinnitus was denied in a February 2022 rating decision.  Thereafter, in May 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim, which was denied in a September 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran filed another Supplemental Claim in November 2022, including a report from the Congressional Research Service detailing the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the access to military records.  After a review of the evidence submitted since the September 2022 rating decision, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been added to the record sufficient to readjudicate the claim.  The evidence added to the record raises the possibility that the Veteran was prevented from filing timely claims with sufficient evidence.  As such, the Board finds that readjudication of the claim is warranted.

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection based on an original claim or claim reopened after a final disallowance is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Whenever any disallowed claim is readjudicated and thereafter allowed on the basis of new and relevant evidence resulting from the correction of the military records of the proper service department under section 1552 of title 10, or the change, correction, or modification of a discharge or dismissal under section 1553 of title 10, or from other corrective action by competent authority, the effective date of commencement of the benefits so awarded shall be the date on which an application was filed for correction of the military record or for the change, modification, or correction of a discharge or dismissal, as the case may be, or the date such disallowed claim was filed, whichever date is the later, but in no event shall such award of benefits be retroactive for more than one year from the date of readjudication of such disallowed claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(i).

Under the implementing regulation, where entitlement is established because of the correction, change or modification of a military record, or of a discharge or dismissal, by a Board established under 10 U.S.C. 1552 or 1553, or because of other corrective action by competent military naval, or air authority, the award will be effective from the latest of these dates: (1) Date application for change, correction, or modification was filed with the service department, in either an original or a disallowed claim; (2) Date of receipt of claim if claim was disallowed; or (3) One year prior to date of reopening of disallowed claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(g)(3).

In effect, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5110(i) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(g), where there is a final disallowed claim and a subsequent correction of the military records, the proper effective date is the latest of three dates: (1) the date on which an application was filed for the change, modification, or correction of a discharge; (2) the date the disallowed claim was filed, and (3) one year prior to readjudication.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. 

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran seeks an earlier service connection effective date for his psychiatric disorder and tinnitus.  After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for both conditions from February 10, 2021, but no earlier.

The Veteran's discharge upgrade was effectuated in September 2021 based on an April 2021 claim.  Normally this would represent the date on which an application was filed for the change, modification, or correction of a discharge. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(g)(1).  However, the record shows that the Veteran had previously filed the exact same claim with BCNR on November 5, 2020, but the claim had dismissed when the BCNR office shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Based on this extraordinary factor, the Board finds the proper date for consideration is November 5, 2020.  

The date of receipt of the previously disallowed claim is November 19, 2018.  This date cannot serve as the proper effective date for the claims on appeal as it is earlier than November 5, 2020.  The previously disallowed claim was readjudicated in a February 10, 2022, rating decision.  Thus, February 10, 2021, one year prior to readjudication of the disallowed claim, is the earliest effective date available under the law. 

In summation, the evidence shows that an effective date of February 10, 2021, but no earlier, is warranted for the grants of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and tinnitus.  To that extent, the claim is granted.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
