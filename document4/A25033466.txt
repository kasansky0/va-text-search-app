FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States from February 1961 to February 1965. Initially, on March 26, 2014, the Veteran filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Ultimately, on February 16, 2024, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision pertinent to the issues on appeal. On February 19, 2025, the Veteran noted a timely appeal of the rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board). 

The appeal was prosecuted pursuant to the modernized review system.   

REASONS FOR REMAND

The AMA abrogated the Secretary's duty to assist for cases on appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(e)(2).  But the duty to assist remains in full force when a claim is before the RO for adjudication. Id. § 5103A(e)(1). And if the Board identifies a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal, it must remand the matter to the RO to cure the error. Id. § 5103A(f)(2)(A). 

As discussed below, the Board finds that there is pre-decisional error in this case, and an addendum VA medical opinion is required on remand to cure the error. 

The Veteran submitted argument in April 2023, prior to the rating decision on appeal, in which he asserted that his PVD was shown in an October 2014 VA examination because he reported swelling in his ankles. Moreover, it was argued that the PVD was shown in a July 2015 VA treatment record because he reported poor circulation to the right leg, thigh discomfort, and right calf cramps. 

The October 2014 examination showed that the Veteran reported swelling in his ankles that occurred every once in a while. A July 2015 VA treatment record showed that the Veteran reported that he was told in the past that he seemed to have poor circulation to right leg; the examiner noted no redness or swelling nor any color change to the feet. A subsequent opinion was not obtained to reconcile these inconsistencies prior to adjudication of the claim in the first instance. 

So, the question for the Board is whether deciding the claim without obtaining an addendum VA opinion, and in this case a retrospective opinion, constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, for which the Board must remand the claim to cure.  Accordingly, the locus of the inquiry is on what was before the RO at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

For the reasons set forth above, based only on the evidence of the record at the time the RO issued the rating decision on appeal, the Board concludes that an addendum VA retrospective opinion should have been obtained prior to a decision being made on this claim that addressed the Veteran's PVD symptoms and the onset of the PVD. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA has provided a VA examination or obtained a medical opinion, it is required to provide or obtain one that is adequate for the purpose sought). 

The Board concludes that the error must be cured, on remand, by obtaining an addendum VA opinion, as outlined below. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

Finally, the issue of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent prior to February 8, 2020, and in excess of 60 percent thereafter, for CAD with atherosclerosis is intertwined with the remanded issue on appeal. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991), overruled on other grounds, Tyrues v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 166, 178 (2009) (en banc)  (issues are "inextricably intertwined" when a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" on a claim for the second issue). And, so, adjudication of this issue is deferred.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain a retrospective opinion regarding the Veteran's service-connected PVD. 

The claims file should be made available to the examiner and review of the file should be noted in the requested report. 

The examiner should record the full history of the PVD, specifically noting the Veteran's symptoms and the date of the onset of the PVD. 

If an examination is required, one should be scheduled.

A rationale for any opinions expressed should be set forth. 

If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion cannot be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that might enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 328 (2010).
