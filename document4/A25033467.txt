REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty training (ADT) from May 1967 to November 1967 and from June 1968 to August 1968, with additional periods of National Guard service.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In this decision the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate the claims on appeal. On the notice of disagreement (NOD) (VA Form 10182) received in July 2024, the Veteran elected the hearing docket. Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in December 2024 and a transcript of the hearing is of record. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period when new evidence was not allowed. In this regard, medical records were added to the claims file between the date of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal and the December 2024 Board hearing. As the Board is deciding these claims, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

New and Relevant Evidence

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R.§ 3.156(d). New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim and includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim on VA Form 21-526EZ claiming service connection for various disabilities including cervical strain, multiple myeloma and sinusitis. The AOJ denied these claims in September 2022, and the Veteran appealed this decision by filing a NOD in September 2022, electing the hearing docket. A Board virtual hearing was held in January 2023. In an August 2023 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that it was unable to produce a complete transcript of the January 2023 hearing and offered the Veteran the opportunity to testify at another Board hearing. The Veteran informed the Board in September 2023 that he did not wish to have another Board hearing and requested that a decision be made based on the evidence of record. Thereafter, in October 2023, the Board remanded the appeal to the AOJ for additional development. In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for sinusitis and cervical strain and deferred the issue of entitlement to service connection for myeloma. In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for myeloma and denied service connection for melanoma. The Veteran filed a higher-level review request of the March 2024 rating decision, and later in March 2024, the AOJ denied service connection for all four claimed disabilities. In April 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim with respect to the March 2024 rating decision. In the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate the claims for service connection for melanoma, cervical strain, sinusitis and myeloma. 

A. Melanoma

Contrary to the AOJ's determination in the July 2024 rating decision that new and relevant evidence was not received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for melanoma, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence was received. The evidence on file at the time of the March 2024 rating decision includes a February 2024 VA contract skin examination report diagnosing the Veteran as having scar, nose melanoma, status post-surgery. The evidence also shows that the Veteran participated in a non-deployment related toxic exposure risk activity. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168; SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 ("PACT Act")). In addition, the evidence shows that in addition to claiming service connection based on the Veteran's toxic exposure, the Veteran also claimed service connection based on his sun exposure while on active duty, to include service in California. See January 2023 Board hearing transcript, pages 6 & 7; see also February 2024 VA contract skin examination report showing the Veteran clarified that he was seeking service connection for melanoma, not myeloma.

Evidence that the Veteran submitted with his April 2024 supplemental claim includes medical information from the Mayo Clinic showing that chronic sun exposure is a risk factor for developing basal cell carcinoma and that there is an increased threat when living in sunny or high-altitude locations. It also includes a private pathological report showing that a biopsy of the Veteran's left nose performed in January 2007 revealed basal cell carcinoma.

The evidence is new because it was not considered at the time of the prior final rating decision in March 2024. It is also relevant, as it tends to prove or disprove a matter of issue. That is, it is relevant to the issue of establishing a nexus between the Veteran's melanoma and service; namely, to sun exposure. Consequently, the Board finds that the evidence is new and relevant thus warranting readjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. To this extent, the appeal is granted. Service connection for melanoma is addressed in the remand section below.

B. Cervical Strain & Sinusitis

The basis of the AOJ's denial of entitlement to service connection for cervical strain and sinusitis in March 2024 is that the evidence did not establish a nexus between these disabilities and the Veteran's active service. Evidence on file at that time includes statements from the Veteran that his neck disability was caused by a pugil stick injury in service that caused him to lose consciousness, and his sinusitis was caused by his exposure to toxic chemicals during service at Camp Pendleton. It also includes the Veteran's service treatment records which are devoid of complaints or treatment related to his neck and show that while serving in the National Guard he was treated for nasal pharyngitis (viral) in July 1981, and for nasal/sinus congestion in June 1988 related to complaints of allergies and sneezing and seasonal problems. 

The evidence on file in March 2024 additionally includes VA contract examination reports in January 2024 diagnosing the Veteran as having cervical strain and sinusitis and containing medical opinions negating a nexus between these diagnoses and the Veteran's service, to include as due to conceded toxic exposure. These examination reports reflect the Veteran's report of being knocked out in service and developing severe headaches which worsened over the years with current complaints of neck pain. They further reflect the Veteran's report that he was exposed to toxic substances in service and has had ongoing sinus problems since service. As noted, the Board conceded in the March 2024 rating decision that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity. 

Evidence on file after the March 2024 decision includes the Veteran's December 2024 Board hearing testimony and additional treatment records that were received within 90 days of the hearing. 

The Veteran's representative asserted at the Board hearing that the hearing testimony constituted new and relevant evidence. However, neither the hearing transcript nor the treatment records constitute evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in these claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). The Veteran testified that he injured his neck in service when he was repeatedly hit in the face with a pugil stick during a fighting exercise causing him to lose consciousness for two minutes. He also testified that his sinusitis is related to his exposure to toxic substances during active service. However, as noted, these reports were already on file and considered by the AOJ in the March 2024 rating decision and are cumulative. The Veteran further testified he would be sending in a medical nexus letter and additional treatment records, but no such medical nexus letter has been received. 

With respect to the additional treatment records that were received within 90 days of the December 2024 hearing, the records include complaints and treatment for neck pain in January 2020, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in January 2023 revealing polysinusitis; however, these conditions were already established by the medical evidence of record in March 2024. Thus, the records do not tend to prove or disprove a matter at issue; namely, a nexus between these claimed disabilities and active service. 

For the reasons laid out above, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has not been received to readjudicate the claims of entitlement to service connection for cervical strain and for sinusitis, and the application to have these claims readjudicated is denied.

Myeloma

The basis of the AOJ's denial of service connection for myeloma in March 2024 is that the evidence did not establish a current diagnosis of myeloma. Evidence on file at that time included a VA contract Hematologic and Lymphatic examination report in February 2024 showing that the Veteran did not have myeloma. This examination report, and a January 2024 VA contract skin examination report, contain the Veteran's remarks that he was not claiming service connection for myeloma, but rather for melanoma. He denied having a history or diagnosis of myeloma. 

Since the March 2024 rating decision, no evidence has been received showing that the Veteran has myeloma and thus no evidence has been received that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

Accordingly, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has not been received to readjudicate the claim for service connection for myeloma, and the application to have this claims readjudicated is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Generally, where the Board finds readjudication of a claim is warranted, but the AOJ did not, the case must be remanded for AOJ adjudication with consideration of the merits of the claim in the first instance unless there is a waiver from the Veteran, or no prejudice would result from the readjudication of the claim. See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010). As the AOJ did not consider the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for melanoma on the merits in July 2024, and the Veteran has not waived his right to AOJ initial consideration, the Board finds that a remand for the AOJ to adjudicate the Veteran's claim in the first instance is necessary.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Undertake appropriate development and adjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for melanoma, to include as due to sun exposure while on active duty.
