DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to increased Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was considered totally disabled from service-connected disabilities for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding his death.

2. The Veteran and the Appellant were legally married in September 2015 and remained married until the Veteran's death in April 2018.

3. Prior to the September 2015 marriage and for well over the continuous eight-year period prior to the Veteran's death, the Appellant and the Veteran cohabitated and were in a marital relationship.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to increased DIC benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 103, 1311; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.10, 3.50, 3.53.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1978 to April 1979.  The Veteran died in April 2018.  The Appellant is his surviving spouse.  

In the April 2019 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on November 18, 2024.  A copy of the transcript has been associated with the record.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Entitlement to increased DIC benefits

As a general rule, a surviving spouse is a person (1) who was validly married to the veteran under 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j) at the time of the veteran's death; (2) "who lived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of the veteran's death (except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the veteran without the fault of the spouse);" and (3) "who has not remarried or...lived with another person and held himself or herself out openly to the public to be the spouse of such other person."  38 U.S.C. § 101(3); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b).

"Marriage" means a marriage valid under the law of the place where the parties resided at the time of the marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j).  If the couple did not continuously cohabitate or was estranged or separated at death, VA must determine whether the separation was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the veteran without the fault of the spouse.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.53.

Additionally, 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2) provides for increased DIC benefits, which are informally known as "8x8" benefits.  These benefits are payable to the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran, who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive compensation for service-connected disability that was rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death.  38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.10(c).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 3.10(f)(1) provides that the surviving spouse must have been married to the veteran for the entire eight-year period to qualify for the 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2) increase.  Thus, the term "8x8 benefits" is used because the veteran must have been totally disabled for eight years and the surviving spouse must have been married to the veteran for those eight years.

The Board has reviewed the evidence and finds that entitlement to increased DIC benefits is warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2).

In the April 2019 decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that the earliest date that the Appellant could be established as the Veteran's VA-defined spouse was September 4, 2013, the date in which the U.S. Attorney General announced that the President had directed the Executive Branch to cease enforcement of 38 U.S.C. 101(3) and (31) to the extent it prevented government agencies from paying benefits based on the marriage of two individuals of the same sex.  Therefore, as the Veteran passed away in April 2018, the AOJ determined that the Appellant and the Veteran were not married for eight years prior to the Veteran's death and the Appellant was not entitled to increased DIC benefits.

By an August 2018 correspondence, the Appellant asserted that he and the Veteran "agreed to be married on September [REDACTED], 1994" and lived together from that day forward as a married couple.  He and the Veteran purchased and lived together in their permanent residence in Texas.  He further indicated he and the Veteran held themselves out as a married couple to their families and Texas government agencies until they were formally married in the state of Colorado in September 2015 until the Veteran's death in April 2018. 

During his August 2024 Board hearing, the Appellant testified to being possession of the Veteran's Bible which included an entry from June 1994, the date in which he asked the Veteran to be his spouse.  He also had a June 1997 letter from the Veteran where he discussed his family's acceptance of their union, despite their religious beliefs.  The Appellant testified that they lived as common law spouses in the state of Texas from 1994 until they were allowed to be officially married in Colorado in September 2015.  The Appellant stated that the Veteran's sister served as a witness.  

The Board notes that while VA statutes and regulations defining the terms "spouse" and "surviving spouse" still include the requirement that a person be a member of the opposite sex in order to qualify as a "surviving spouse," that portion of the definition is no longer enforced to the extent that it would deny DIC or other benefits to lawful same-sex marriages.  VAOPGCPREC 3-2014 (June 17, 2014); VAOPGCPREC 4-2014 (June 17, 2014); see also Cardona v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 472, 481 (2014) (dismissing the case as moot due to the Secretary's official change in policy with regard to 38 U.S.C. § 101(31)).  The General Counsel Opinion directed that "VA will administer spousal benefits to same-sex married couples, provided their marriages meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 103(c)."

Both General Counsel Opinions are based on the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013), and the then-administration's directive that the Executive Branch cease enforcement of definitions of surviving spouse in Title 38 to the extent that they would limit recognition of marital status to opposite sex couples.  Further guidance in the form of federal legislation and regulation has not been provided following the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. 644 (2015) (holding that state laws excluding same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples violate the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment).

However, the Secretary of VA issued pertinent guidance in October 2022.  The subject of this VA Memorandum is "Instructions for Determining Whether Same-Sex Surviving Spouses Satisfy Duration of Marriage Requirements."  The purpose of the memorandum is to issue instructions for determining whether same-sex couples satisfy the duration of marriage requirement to qualify for DIC benefits.  The Secretary recognized that the legal impediment precluding DIC benefits to certain same-sex couples existed under laws now recognized as unconstitutional and that Congress did not intend VA to apply unconstitutional laws to veterans' detriment.  The Secretary, therefore, has instructed that for all claims that are pending and nonfinal as of October 11, 2022, VA will consider a marriage duration requirement to be satisfied when there is satisfactory evidence that a same-sex surviving spouse was effectively in a marital relationship for the requisite period.  In applying this standard, VA generally will follow the same evidentiary rules applicable in establishing any marital relationship: that the surviving spouse was legally married to the veteran at the time of the veteran's death; that they held themselves out to the public as being in a committed relationship akin to that of marriage; and that they cohabitated.  Additionally, the memorandum provides that the instruction will similarly be applied for awarding 8x8 benefits if the surviving spouse is able to provide the same verification for a period of eight consecutive years prior to the veteran's death.

VA acknowledges that it may have been impracticable for same-sex couples to have entered a marriage immediately after Obergefell was decided.  As such, the Secretary directed that this Instruction apply in the case of any same-sex surviving spouse who married a veteran up through two years after Obergefell i.e., June 26, 2017.  To permit consistent and equal application and avoid a disparate result, the Instruction applies to all same-sex couples who married on or before June 26, 2017, regardless of state of residence, as U.S. states and territories maintained varying same-sex marriage provisions at the time Obergefell was issued.

The Board find that the evidence supports a finding of entitlement to increased DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2).  The evidence establishes that the Veteran was in receipt of a total disability rating for over eight years prior to his death and that the Veteran and Appellant were legally married at the time of the Veteran's death.  Further, pursuant to the October 2022 VA Memorandum, the probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran and Appellant were in a marital relationship and cohabitated for at least the continuous eight year period prior to the Veteran's death.  Notably, a statement provided by T.A. indicates that she is the Veteran's sister, and her family was aware that the Appellant and her brother "got married" in September 1994 on the beach at Galveston, Texas.  She also acknowledged serving as a witness when they were officially married in September 2015.  See Buddy/Lay Statement, received August 29, 2018.  The record also includes a monthly mortgage statement addressed to both the Appellant and the Veteran, which supports a finding that they cohabitated since, at least, 2003.  See Pension Bank Statement, received August 29, 2018, pp. 6-7.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim of entitlement to increased DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1311(a)(2).  Therefore, the appeal is granted.
