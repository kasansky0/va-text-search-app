ORDER

Service connection for nerve condition, left lower extremity is denied.

Service connection for nerve condition, right lower extremity is denied.

Service connection for nerve condition, right upper extremity is denied.

Service connection for neck condition is denied.

Service connection for right ankle condition is denied.

Service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. No current nerve condition of the left lower extremity, right lower extremity, or right upper extremity was shown during the pendency of the Veteran's claims for service connection or recent to the filing of the claims.

2. No neck condition, right ankle condition, or right ear hearing loss was shown during service or for many years thereafter, and the most probative evidence is against finding that the Veteran's current neck condition, right ankle condition, or right ear hearing loss is related to his service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for nerve condition, left lower extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for nerve condition, right lower extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for nerve condition, right upper extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

4. The criteria for service connection for neck condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

5. The criteria for service connection for right ankle condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

6. The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1972 to April 1979 and from July 1983 to February 1985.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In September 2024, the Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, electing the Direct Review docket. The Board notes that the Veteran's VA Form 10182 was accompanied by additional evidence. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023) (holding that the Board has a duty to seek clarification of a veteran's intention to elect the Direct Review docket when additional evidence is submitted with a Form 10182 electing direct review). Accordingly, the Board's September 2024 docketing letter informed the Veteran that the Board cannot consider any evidence submitted with his Form 10182 electing the Direct Review docket. The letter further informed the Veteran that if he wanted to have the evidence submitted with his Form 10182 considered in conjunction with this appeal, he would need to request a docket switch. As the Veteran has not since requested a docket switch, the Board will proceed with adjudication of the case on the Direct Review docket.

Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision. See 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the September 2023 rating decision was not considered. If the Veteran would like any such evidence to be considered, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

In November 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted an appeal brief 1) challenging the competency of the June 2023 VA neck and ankle conditions examiner and 2) requesting a copy of the examiner's curriculum vitae (CV) and other information about her qualifications. 

Regarding the Veteran's request for the examiner's CV, the Board notes that in Francway v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that VA's duty to assist under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A required VA to produce evidence of the competency of an examiner when requested by a Veteran. 940 F.3d 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2019). However, Francway was an interpretation of the legacy version of 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, whereas the present case has been adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  As the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has noted, the AMA is a "whole new world" for adjudicating Veteran's benefits. Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, 156-157 (2021). 

Under the AMA, VA's duty to assist was modified. The AMA version of 38 U.S.C. § 5103A specifically states that the duty to assist shall not apply to review on appeal by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(e)(2).  Under the AMA, remand is warranted only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). Therefore, in an AMA appeal, unless the request for the examiner's CV was received prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, there would be no duty to assist error on VA's part in not fulfilling the request, and a remand would not be proper on this basis. 

Here, the Veteran's request for the VA examiner's CV was not received until November 2024. VA's duty to assist here ended with the September 2023 rating decision. If the Veteran had wanted to request the VA examiner's qualifications after September 2023, he had the option of filing a supplemental claim (to which VA's duty to assist would apply). Instead, the Veteran chose to appeal the September 2023 rating decision, which foreclosed any additional duty to assist by VA. In sum, as the Veteran's request for the examiner's curriculum vitae was received after the rating decision on appeal, there is no duty to assist error on VA's part in not fulfilling the request, and remand for any such development would not be proper as the Board does not have the statutory authority to remand an appeal on such basis.

To the extent the Veteran questions the competency of the June 2023 VA examiner, the Board notes that VA regulations state that competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). The Veteran's representative states that the June 2023 examiner is a "general medicine nurse practitioner" with "no special training, education, or experience that would qualify her to make assessments on the complex, long-standing and degenerative" conditions of the Veteran. However, nurse practitioners have been deemed to have sufficient qualifications to conduct VA examinations. Cox. v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 563, 569 (2007) (holding that VA satisfied its duty to assist when it provided a medical examination by a nurse practitioner, as a nurse practitioner has completed medical education and training as required by § 3.159(a)(1)). 

The Veteran has not provided any specific reason why a specialist is needed to provide an opinion in this case, nor any specific reason why the June 2023 examiner was not competent to offer an opinion in this case. In addition, the June 2023 examiner's examination reports give no indication that she was not fully competent to opine in this matter. See Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 527 (2014). The June 2023 neck and ankle examination reports show that the examiner is a certified nurse practitioner; accordingly, the Board finds that she has had medical education and training sufficient to qualify her to provide competent medical evidence. See Francway v. Wilkie, 930 F.3d at 1379-82; Cox, 20 Vet. App. at 569. Therefore, the Board also finds that the June 2023 neck and ankle conditions examinations are adequate for adjudication. If the Veteran would like to raise further argument regarding the competency of the VA examiner, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Lastly, the Board notes that the Veteran's complete service treatment records (STRs) are not available. In response to several requests from the RO for the Veteran's STRs from his first period of active duty, the National Personnel Records Center responded in April 2021 that all available STRs had already been provided. In August 2021, the Veteran was notified of the unavailability of his STRs from his 1972 to 1979 period of active duty. The Board acknowledges its heightened duty to consider applicability of the benefit of the doubt rule and to explain its decision when service records are lost or missing. See Cromer v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 215, 217-18 (2005) (citing Russo v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 46, 51 (1996)). However, no presumption arises from missing records. Cromer, 19 Vet. App. at 217-18.

Service connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may alternatively be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995). In cases of aggravation of a veteran's nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability, the veteran shall be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

The Board also notes that when a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more and peripheral neuropathy, arthritis, or hearing loss manifest to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation and in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). "Current" means near the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). "Disability" refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed Cir. 2018) (holding that pain resulting in functional impairment can constitute a disability even without an identified underlying diagnosis). Functional impairment in earning capacity can be demonstrated by "showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person." Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

1. Service connection for nerve condition, left lower extremity.

2. Service connection for nerve condition, right lower extremity.

3. Service connection for nerve condition, right upper extremity.

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for nerve conditions affecting his extremities. Regarding his lower extremities, the Veteran reports symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain and that his right foot sometimes scrapes the ground when he walks. Regarding his upper extremities, the Veteran reports symptoms of numbness, tingling, shooting pain, and aching. See May 2023 Veteran statements. 

The initial question for the Board regarding these claims is whether the Veteran has a current extremity nerve condition or conditions. Upon review of the record on appeal, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of any such disability and has not had a current diagnosis of any such disability at any time during the pendency of the claims for service connection or recent to the filing of the claims.  The Veteran's STRs and post-service treatment records are negative for any complaints, diagnosis, or treatment of any extremity nerve condition. 

Additionally, a VA back conditions examination was obtained in June 2023. The examiner reported that the Veteran does not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy. The examiner further reported normal muscle strength, normal reflexes, normal sensory examinations, and normal straight leg raising tests bilaterally. 

A VA neck conditions examination was obtained in June 2023. The examiner reported no radicular pain and no signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy. The examiner further reported normal muscle strength, normal reflexes, and normal sensory examinations.

While the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, the diagnosis of a disability manifested by such symptoms requires medical expertise to determine. Thus, any opinion of the Veteran regarding any current disability is not competent medical evidence. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis or etiology). 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not received a VA peripheral neuropathy conditions examination pursuant to his claims for service connection for nerve conditions of the extremities. However, at the time of the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, there was no probative evidence of any current extremity nerve condition disability. Therefore, a VA medical examination and opinion were not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2006). The Board acknowledges that pain resulting in functional impairment can constitute a disability even without an identified underlying diagnosis. See Saunders, 866 F.3d at 1367-68. However, in this case, there is also no objective evidence of extremity pain resulting in functional impairment.

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. As the probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a current nerve condition disability of any extremity, there is no basis upon which service connection can be awarded. See Degmetich, 104 F.3d at 1333. 

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and the claims for service connection for nerve conditions of the extremities are denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

4. Service connection for neck condition

5. Service connection for right ankle condition

6. Service connection for right ear hearing loss

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for a neck condition, a right ankle condition, and right ear hearing loss.  While current cervical spine, right ankle, and right ear hearing loss conditions are shown by the record, there is no probative evidence that these conditions were incurred in or caused by the Veteran's active service. The Veteran's STRs are negative for complaints, diagnosis, or treatment of any neck condition, right ankle condition, or hearing loss. VA neck conditions, ankle conditions, and hearing loss examinations were obtained in June 2023.

Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for a neck condition (claimed as cervical spine osteoarthritis with pain and spasm), the June 2023 examiner noted diagnoses of ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis of the cervical spine. The Veteran reported that his neck pain onset in the 1980s and that he believes it comes from jumping out of helicopters and airplanes during his service. However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's ankylosing spondylitis and spinal stenosis were less likely than not incurred in or caused by his service. The examiner explained that while duty as a parachutist could result in cervical spine conditions, the Veteran's particular condition of ankylosing spondylitis is generally attributed to genetic risk factors. Regarding the Veteran's spinal stenosis, the examiner explained that spinal stenosis is due to the ankylosing spondylitis. The Board finds the examiner's opinion to be probative as it considers the medical evidence of record, provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data, and stands uncontroverted in the record. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

In a May 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that during his active service he went to medical several times for neck pain. However, as noted above, the Veteran's STRs are negative for any neck-related complaints. (While the Veteran's STRs from his first period of service (1972-1979) are not available, the Veteran has asserted that his neck pain onset during the 1980s. See June 2023 VA neck conditions examination.) The Veteran's February 1985 separation examination reported a normal neck and spine. Regarding the post-service period, the record contains no indication of any neck complaints or diagnosis for several decades after the Veteran's service. Accordingly, the Board does not find persuasive the Veteran's lay evidence of neck pain since active service. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-1337 (2006).

Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for a right ankle condition (claimed as right ankle arthritis), the June 2023 examiner noted a diagnosis of right ankle posttraumatic arthritis status post right ankle fracture. The Veteran reported that his ankles have "bothered him" since his in-service parachute jumps. The Veteran also noted to the examiner that after service he fractured his right ankle and had to have screws put in. Indeed, the Veteran's post-service treatment records note chronic right ankle pain following a right ankle fracture in 2009. See, e.g., December 2020 VA treatment record. The June 2023 examiner provided a medical opinion that the Veteran's right ankle arthritis was less likely than not incurred in or caused by his service. Consistent with the Veteran's post-service treatment records, the examiner attributes the Veteran's current right ankle condition to his 2009 right ankle fracture and subsequent surgery. 

In a May 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that he injured both his ankles during in-service physical training exercises and during parachute jumps. He reports having issues with his ankle since active duty. However, as noted above, the Veteran's STRs are negative for any ankle-related complaints. The Veteran's February 1985 separation examination reported normal lower extremities and feet. The record contains no indication of any ankle complaints, diagnosis, or treatment prior to treatment for the Veteran's 2009 ankle fracture. Based on all the above, the Board finds the June 2023 examiner's opinion that the Veteran's current right ankle arthritis is related to his 2009 right ankle fracture rather than to his service to be well-supported by the evidence of record and therefore probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for right ear hearing loss, the Veteran notes that during his service he was exposed to "frequent varying levels of ear noise trauma" from tanks, track vehicles, armored fighting vehicles, 2.5-ton trucks, 5-ton trucks, tractor trailers, helicopters, cargo/passenger planes, flight line noises, mortars, grenades, artillery, machine guns, rifles, pistols, shoulder-fired missiles, loud headset noise, and generators. See Veteran's May 2023 statement. The Veteran underwent a VA hearing loss examination in June 2023 and the examiner provided a diagnosis of right ear hearing loss. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 ("For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent."). 

The examiner noted that based on the Veteran's Military Occupational Specialty of Infantryman, in-service noise exposure has been conceded. However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was less likely than not due to his in-service noise exposure. In support of this opinion, the examiner noted that the Veteran's right ear hearing was normal on his separation examination and that he had a post-service career of carpentry as well as post-service recreational motorcycle use. The Board finds the examiner's opinion to be probative as it considers the medical evidence of record, provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data, and stands uncontroverted in the record. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

In a November 2024 appeal brief, the Veteran's representative argues that as the Veteran is service-connected for tinnitus and "since excessive noise exposure is known to cause auditory damage which causes tinnitus," it follows that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss is also a result of military noise exposure. The Board does not find this extrapolated and conclusory lay argument to be persuasive. The Veteran's representative also argues that the Veteran's hearing loss is likely exacerbated by his service-connected tinnitus; however, no support is provided for this statement and the Board thus does not find it to be probative. 

In the absence of probative evidence that the Veteran's neck, right ankle, or right ear hearing loss conditions were incurred during service (or, in the case of his arthritis and hearing loss, during service or within one year of service) or are otherwise related to service or a service-connected condition, service connection is not warranted. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and the claims for service connection for a neck condition, a right ankle condition, and right ear hearing loss are denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
