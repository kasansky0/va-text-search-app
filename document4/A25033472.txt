DOCKET NO. 221104-291817
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for a psychiatric disability, to include anxiety, has been withdrawn.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the appellant, through the authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for a psychiatric disability, to include anxiety, by the appellant's authorized representative, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1970 to November 1970.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from an October 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In November 2022, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), requesting the Hearing Lane.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for a psychiatric disability, to include anxiety, 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant's authorized representative has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Here, in a March 2025 letter to the Board, the Veteran's representative explicitly noted withdraw of both the claim for increased rating, cited in his November 2022 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) contesting the rating assigned for his service-connected psychiatric condition, and his hearing request. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
