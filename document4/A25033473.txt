ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for skin lesion (claimed as melanoma) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in approximate balance whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is due to his in-service toxic exposure risk activities (TERA).

2. The evidence is in approximate balance whether the Veteran's skin lesion (claimed as melanoma) is due to his in-service TERA.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for skin lesion (claimed as melanoma) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1972 to September 1978. 

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying the Veteran's service-connection claims for prostate cancer and melanoma in August 2023, which constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for prostate cancer and melanoma most recently addressed in the August 2023 rating decision.  In May 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty-to-assist argument).

The Board acknowledges that less than a year has passed since the issuance of the rating decision on appeal, and so the Veteran is within the one-year timeframe during which he could choose to change which docket lane his appeal is docketed under. However, because service connection is being granted for both claims on appeal, the Board finds that the Veteran is not prejudiced by the adjudication of his appeal prior to the expiration of the time during which he could elect to switch dockets.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed, or recent to or during the pendency of that claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer is the result of his active-duty service as a pilot in the Air Force, specifically due to being "exposed to radiation while operating F106." See March 2023 Claim. 

The May 2024 rating decision denied service connection for prostate cancer because it found, based on the results of a July 2023 VA examination and medical opinion, that there was no link between the Veteran's prostate cancer and his military service. In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded, and that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of prostate cancer, post prostatectomy. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service records do not contain any mention of prostate cancer. 

A VA treatment note dated March 1, 2018, notes that the Veteran has no family history of cancer. A VA primary care note dated February 14, 2019, reflects that the Veteran's medical history includes "prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy: stable. follows with outside urologist." A VA treatment note dated April 1, 2023, indicates that the Veteran's urologist is Dr. D.F. and that the Veteran had a robotic prostatectomy performed in 2018. 

The Veteran's private treatment notes show that a "malignant neoplasm of prostate" was noted on September 28, 2017, and a robotic assisted prostatectomy was performed on November 14, 2017.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023 regarding his prostate cancer claim. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of prostate cancer with prostatectomy with a diagnosis date of 2023, and noted that his prostate cancer's date of onset was 2017, and that it was resolved with residual issues. The VA examiner stated that the Veteran had undergone a radical prostatectomy in 2022. The VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion finding that the Veteran's prostate cancer was less likely than not due to the Veteran's in-service TERA, with the following rationale: 

There is no medical or scientific evidence available at this time that provides indication of a relationship between development of prostate cancer and the Veteran's toxic exposure with an MOS [of] Pilot. There is an absence of a causative, pathophysiological connection between the prostate cancer and the Veteran's MOS as a Pilot.

The Veteran submitted a letter from a private physician, Dr. B.P., stating the following: 

I am writing this letter on behalf of [the Veteran]. I have been asked to provide an opinion regarding the possible increase in risk of cancer that can be attributed to his exposure to radiation that occurred while serving in the United States Air Force. [The Veteran] has approximately 2000 hours as a pilot in the F106 and was exposed to radiation emitted by the radar.

[The Veteran] later developed prostate cancer and melanoma. He does not have a family history of these cancers. He does not have other risk factors that increase the risk of these cancers.

In my opinion, it is more likely than not that his exposure to radar-related radiation is the primary risk factor and cause of his prostate cancer and melanoma.

There are thus two medical opinions of record regarding the issue of whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is due to his in-service TERA. Despite noting that the Veteran's entire e-folder was reviewed, the VA medical examination contains some inconsistencies that conflict with the medical evidence of record. For example, the July 2023 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) states that the date of diagnosis for prostate cancer was 2023, with an onset date of 2017, but also that the Veteran had undergone a radical prostatectomy in 2022. His VA treatment notes, however, show that even in February 2019 he was noted to have had a prior prostatectomy; and his private treatment notes, which were also of record at the time of the VA examination, indicated that his prostatectomy took place in November 2017. Furthermore, despite stating that the negative nexus opinion was reached "after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all [TERA] of the Veteran," the July 2023 VA examiner does not mention any particular toxic exposure that is taken into account, or even mention radiation-which the Veteran contends caused his prostate cancer-at all, besides noting that the Veteran does not qualify for presumptive exposure to ionizing radiation. Dr. B.P.'s positive nexus letter, however, shows that the effect of radiation from radar was specifically considered, as well as showing that the absence of other risk factors and family history of cancer was also considered. Although Dr. B.P.'s opinion does not specifically state that all evidence of record was reviewed, it reflects a medical opinion that is based on an accurate factual basis and considers the specific claimed cause of the prostate cancer.

The Board finds that both medical opinions were written by competent medical professionals, although both medical opinions are less than entirely probative. The evidence is in approximate balance as to the issue of whether the Veteran's prostate cancer is the result of his service. Resolving all reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for prostate cancer is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  His appeal is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for skin lesion

The Veteran contends that his melanoma condition is the result of his active-duty service as a pilot in the Air Force, specifically due to "[r]adiation exposure while flying F106." See March 2023 Claim.

The May 2024 rating decision denied service connection for melanoma because it found, based on the results of a July 2023 VA examination and medical opinion, that there was no link between the Veteran's melanoma and his military service, and that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of melanoma. In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded, and that the Veteran has a current disability based on the July 2023 examination documenting a finding of excision of lesion on upper back with residual scarring. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service records do not contain any mention of melanoma or skin cancer. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023 regarding his melanoma claim. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's reports that he had had a malignant melanoma removed in 2022, but indicated that "evidence from available records was not found. No biopsy result or medical record to support a diagnosis of melanoma; therefore, Excision of lesion on upper back due to unknown etiology with residual scarring was diagnosed." The VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion finding that the Veteran's claimed melanoma condition was less likely than not due to the Veteran's in-service TERA, with the following rationale: 

There is no medical or scientific evidence available at this time that provides indication of a relationship between development of skin lesion/melanoma and the Veteran's toxic exposure with MOS as Pilot. There is an absence of a causative, pathophysiological connection between the diagnosed condition and the Veteran's MOS as a Pilot.

A December 2023 nexus letter from Dr. B.P. gave a positive nexus opinion for the Veteran's skin lesion.  As rationale, the private physician considered the Veteran's exposure to radiation that occurred while serving as a pilot during his service, and assessing that the Veteran "did not have any other risk factors that increase the risk of [the skin disability."  

Once again, there are two medical opinions regarding whether there is a causative link between the Veteran's in-service TERA and his current disability of melanoma/skin lesion. Neither medical opinion indicates that it is based on a review of medical records reflecting the original diagnosis of melanoma, or documenting the removal of a skin lesion. However, VA has conceded that the Veteran has a current disability of skin lesion (claimed as melanoma). Once again, the VA examiner does not mention in-service radiation exposure as the claimed cause, whereas Dr. B.P. shows that he considered the in-service radiation exposure, as well as the lack of a family history of cancer which is also reflected in the Veteran's medical records. 

Again, the evidence is in approximate balance as to the issue of whether the Veteran's skin lesion (claimed as melanoma) is the result of his service. Resolving all reasonable doubts in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for skin lesion (claimed as melanoma) is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  His appeal is granted.
