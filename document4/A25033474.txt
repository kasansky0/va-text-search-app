ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of lumbosacral strain is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of flexion is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of extension is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of migraines is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a May 10, 2022, claim for service connection of, as relevant to this appeal, a back condition, a knee condition, and migraines.

2. Receipt of the claim dated May 10, 2022, was confirmed in an August 3, 2022, correspondence, which advised that no further action was needed.

3. An August 4, 2022, VA correspondence notified the Veteran that her claim was filed on the improper form. 

4. The procedural defect was timely and properly cured by the Veteran when she submitted an August 17, 2022, VA Form 20-0995 within 60 days of notice.

5. As entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain, right knee strain limitation of flexion and extension, and migraines arose prior to May 10, 2022, the effective date is the date of the claim, or May 10, 2022.

1. The criteria for an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of lumbosacral strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3,2500, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of flexion have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3,2500, 3.400.

3. The criteria for an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of extension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3,2500, 3.400.

4. The criteria for an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of migraines have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3,2500, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service in the United States Army from February 2002 to February 2006.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2023 decision.  In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2023 decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of lumbosacral strain

2. Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of flexion

3. Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of right knee strain, limitation of extension

4. Entitlement to an effective date before June 23, 2022, for service connection of migraines

In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for lumbosacral strain, right knee strain, limitation of flexion and extension, and migraines, with an effective date of June 23, 2022. The Veteran contends that the effective date should be May 10, 2022, the date on which she filed a new claim on a VA Form 21-526EZ.

Earlier Effective Dates

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Exceptions to this rule include a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on newly obtained service department records under certain circumstances, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c), and when the decision is revised or reversed because of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A (a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). An informal claim must identify the benefits sought; and upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

Although a claimant need not identify the benefit sought "with specificity," see Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199-200 (1992), some intent on the part of the Veteran to seek benefits must be demonstrated. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). See also Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-7 (1995) (noting that while VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to fully and sympathetically develop a Veteran's claim to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). The effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

In general, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a finally adjudicated claim, VA shall reopen and review the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers. Relevant evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.

When all the evidence is assembled, the Secretary is then responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

As for the "date entitlement arose," there is no regulatory definition of the phrase. However, in Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343 (1997), the phrase "date entitlement arose" was found to be like the phrase "facts found." This case, along with the regulatory context, strongly suggest that the "date entitlement arose" is the date on which the facts in the case demonstrate that the entitling criteria are first met. The entitling criteria for a claim are frequently met on or before the date of claim based on the lay, medical, and other information presented during the entire process of claim development. When applying the general rule, the assignment of an effective date based on date entitlement arose being later than the date of receipt of the claim is only appropriate when the evidence clearly establishes that the entitling criteria were not met as of the date of receipt of the claim.

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, were: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

Treatment records do not constitute informal claims when service connection has not yet been established for the condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157; Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002). While the VA should broadly interpret submission from a Veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995). However, the Board notes that 38C.F.R. §3.157 (b)(1), in effect prior to March 24, 2015, provided that once a formal claim for compensation has been allowed or a formal claim for compensation disallowed for the reason that the service-connected disability is not compensable in degree, the date of treatment or examination or date of admission to a VA or uniformed services hospital will be accepted as the date of receipt of a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 (b)(1). This regulation "makes clear that a medical examination report will only be considered an informal claim for an increase in disability benefits if service connection has already been established for the disability. MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Informal claims as originally codified in 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155 and 3.157 prior to that date were eliminated.

Under the legacy review system, once the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issues a decision on a claim, a claimant must file a NOD with that determination by the AOJ within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination, otherwise, that determination will become final. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system, a NOD shall also be filed within one year from the date of the issuance of notice of the decision of the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. A NOD postmarked before the expiration of the one-year period shall be accepted as timely filed. Id. 

If no NOD is filed in accordance within the prescribed period, the action or decision of the AOJ shall become final and the claim shall not thereafter be readjudicated or allowed, except (1) in the case of a readjudication or allowance pursuant to a higher-level review that was requested in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104B; (2) as may otherwise be provided by filing a supplemental claim pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5108; or (3) as may otherwise be provided in such regulations as are consistent with this 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

All supplemental claims must present with new and relevant evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. The requirement for new and relevant evidence applies to supplemental claims regardless of whether the prior claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated. Id. 

If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. Id. If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim. Id. In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records (VATRs) reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed. Id. 

A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, on the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary within one year from the date on which the AOJ) issues a notice of decision on a claim or issue as specified (except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c), (e), and (f)), after any decision by the AOJ: (1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

The standard of proof to be applied in decisions on claims for VA benefits is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b). Under that provision, VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case before the Secretary with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). "It is in recognition of our debt to our veterans that society has [determined that,] [b]y tradition and by statute, the benefit of the doubt belongs to the veteran." Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54. To deny a claim on its merits, there must be a showing that the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the Veteran's claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Based on a review of the records, the Board finds that the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2022, for service connection of lumbosacral strain, right knee strain, limitation of flexion and extension, and migraines.

Procedural History

In an October 2007 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for, in part, migraine headaches, right knee pain, and lower back pain. This decision was not appealed and became final.

On May 10, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ and sought service connection for, as relevant here, a back condition, a knee condition, and migraines. See May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. With this claim, the Veteran submitted treatment records not previously part of the record which show a diagnosis of migraine at least as early as October 2019, and diagnoses of right knee pain and low back pain at least as early as February 2021. See Private Treatment Records. 

On May 17, 2022 and June 23, 2022, the Veteran submitted Intent to File forms.

The Veteran then submitted VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Applications on July 11, 2022 for migraines, and on July 14, 2022 for the right knee and back.

In an August 3, 2022, correspondence, the VA confirmed receipt of the Veteran's May 10, 2022, application for benefits and indicated in enlarged, underlined font that no action was needed at that time. See August 2022 Correspondence.

The next day, on August 4, 2022, the VA notified the Veteran that her claim for migraine, knee condition, right, sleep disturbances, back condition, skin condition, pregnancy, surgical complications of, high blood pressure, motion sickness, and wrist condition, right was filed on the improper form.

On August 17, 2022, the Veteran filed another VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, identifying, in part, migraines, low back pain, and right knee pain. With this form, the Veteran's representative submitted a correspondence indicating that this form was filed in response to the VA's August 4, 2022, correspondence, however, the Veteran properly filed her supplemental claims the previous month, in July.

Service connection for these conditions was granted in a January 2023 rating decision, with an effective date of June 23, 2022, which is the date of the latest Intent to File form.

In a December 2023 correspondence, the Veteran's representative argued that the effective date should be May 10, 2022, as this was the date the Veteran initially filed for service connection, and this should be considered the intent to file (ITF) date. The Veteran requests that the Board apply a liberal reading to the issue. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's argument that the May 10, 2022, paperwork documenting the Veteran's intent to reopen the claims was filed on May 10, 2022, and this should be considered the ITF date.

Here, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, How to file a claim, is the guiding applicable law on an intent to file claim. As discussed above, the October 2007 decision was not appealed and became final under the legacy review system. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52.

As the October 2007 rating decision finalized, to specifically initiate readjudication of the claims for service connection of a back condition, knee condition, and migraines, at any time thereafter, the Veteran was required to file the claims on a prescribed form. As noted above, readjudication of the claims would be triggered when either a higher-level review was requested in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104B; (2) as may otherwise be provided by filing a supplemental claim pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5108; or (3) as may otherwise be provided in such regulations as are consistent with this 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

On the other hand, to file an intent to file claim, notwithstanding the issue to be claimed, an intent to file claim may be filed on a prescribed form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

However, the Veteran next filed another VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim on May 10, 2022, in which she requested service connection for these issues.

Accordingly, the filing of a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim on May 10, 2022, was not the prescribed form to initiate readjudication of the claims for service connection or an intent to file claim. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

To explain, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) provides that a claimant or duly authorized representative who indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA, by a communication or action, to include an electronic mail that is transmitted through VA's electronic portal or otherwise, that does not meet the standards of a complete claim is considered a request for an application form for benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 3.150 (a). Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or forms prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

While the modernized VA appeals system requires particular forms to accomplish specific tasks (e.g. a complete application to begin a claim), there are uniquely pro-claimant principles underlying the veterans' benefits system. See Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 710 F.3d 1328, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Evans v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 7, 14 (2011) (stating that the VA system is "veteran-friendly" and "non-adversarial"); Kouvaris v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 377, 381 (2009) (noting that the veterans' benefits system is a "veteran-friendly" system); see also Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 412 (2009) ("Congress has expressed special solicitude for the veterans' cause...the adjudicatory process is not truly adversarial"). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit put it, "[t]he VA disability compensation system is not meant to be a trap for the unwary." Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

In the circumstances of this case, the Veteran filed an initial package indicating an intent to seek benefits on May 10, 2022. The submission contained everything necessary for a complete claim at the time except for the fact that it was on a VA Form 21-526EZ rather than a VA Form 20-0995. After receiving notice of the deficiency, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 identifying each issue for which she sought service connection. The Veteran made multiple good faith efforts to supply the necessary information on the right form.

The remaining question is what the appropriate effective date is. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(1)(ii), the proper effective date is generally the date of receipt of claim. Moreover, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(i) provides that, if VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed on a supplemental claim form (as here), the claim will be considered as filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim. See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (c) (providing one year to cure defects in an incomplete application form). Here, the Veteran submitted an August 2022 VA Form 20-0995 within 60 days of the VA's August 4, 2022, notice to cure a defect. So, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(i), May 10, 2022, would be the date of claim. 

Under the facts of this case and considering the veteran-friendly nature of the VA system, the Board finds that the Veteran, by her May 10, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ, indicated a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). The VA mailed the Veteran an August 3, 2022, letter indicating that the Veteran's May 10, 2022, claim in an August 4, 2022, correspondence and advised that no action was necessary at this time. The next day, however, the VA mailed the Veteran another correspondence advising that her claim was filed on the improper form. The confusing nature of the VA's back-to-back correspondences advising first that the May 10, 2022, claim was received, and no action was necessary, and the next day, advising that the claim was submitted on the improper form, mandates that the Board afford the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in this scenario. Despite the contradicting back-to-back VA correspondences, the Veteran remained proactive and complied with the August 3, 2022, VA correspondence by submitting an August 17, 2022, VA Form 20-0995, within 60 days of the notice of defect.

Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran properly cured any defect within 60 days of the VA's notice of same, preserving her May 10, 2022, date of claim.

?

Hence, weighing the evidence in favor of the Veteran and affording the Veteran the complete benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim is to be considered as filed as of the date of receipt of the May 10, 2022, application. As such, the evidence demonstrates that entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain, right knee strain, limitation of flexion, right knee strain, limitation of extension, and migraines is warranted, and this appeal is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
