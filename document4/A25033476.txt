DOCKET NO. 240229-421736
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for a total right knee replacement (hereinafter right knee disability) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The February 2024 VA Form 10182 did not allege any error of fact or law with the 30 percent evaluation assigned in the February 2024 rating decision for the Veteran's right knee disability; there is no case or controversy to decide. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for a right knee disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from a December 2003 to February 2005.  She also had prior and subsequent periods of Reserve service. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Thus, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. 

Regarding the issue on appeal, on her February 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran stated her disagreement with the February 2024 rating decision was that her claim was for her "left knee replacement," not an increase for her service-connected right knee replacement.  As noted above, there has been no determination of entitlement or non-entitlement as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. 20.200 regarding the October 23, 2023 "new claim" for service connection for a left knee replacement.  See October 23, 2023 VA Form 526EZ.  Thus, that claim is not ripe for Board review as it remains pending before the AOJ.  The Veteran may resubmit the October 23, 2023 VA Form 526EZ or notify the AOJ that issue is still pending.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  In the present case, the Veteran has not alleged an error of fact or law with the claim adjudicated in the February 2024 rating decision.  Rather, she alleged the AOJ adjudicated the wrong claim.  See February 29, 2024 VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, the Board must dismiss this appeal, as there is no case or controversy before the Board pertaining to the 30 percent evaluation assigned for the Veteran's right knee disability in the February 2024 rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105(d).
