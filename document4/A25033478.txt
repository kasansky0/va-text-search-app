ORDER

Duplicative challenges to the June 2022 decision of the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC) that denied the Veteran's claim for a waiver of the recoupment of his overpayment debt in the amount of $22,288.39 are dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Challenges to the June 2022 COWC decision that denied the Veteran's claim for a waiver of the recoupment of his overpayment debt in the amount of $22,288.39 have already been addressed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in the appeal docketed under the index number 220705-25822.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the instant duplicative appeal challenging the June 2022 COWC decision that denied the Veteran's claim for a waiver of the recoupment of his overpayment debt in the amount of $22,288.39 have been met. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, a former Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) need-based pensioner and a current VA compensation beneficiary, had active duty from May 1967 to May 1970. This matter comes before the Board on his appeal from the June 2022 COWC decision that denied the Veteran's claim for a waiver of the recoupment of his overpayment debt in the amount of $22,288.39. However, the Veteran's challenges to that effect have already been addressed by the Board in the appeal docketed under the index number 220705-25822 and remanded this matter to VA. Thus, for all practical purposes, the appeal at bar qualifies as duplicative, even though the Board acknowledges that the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement (NOD) underlying the appeal at bar was not a physical copy of the appeal docketed under the index number 220705-25822. Correspondingly, the instant appeal presents the Board with all considerations applicable to duplicative matters and must be dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.2500(b); see also Bradley v. Chiron Corp., Nos. 96-1516, 96-1536; 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 31136, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 13, 1996); Hernandez-Carrasquillo v. McDonough, No. 23-1466, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1537 (Sep. 29, 2023); accord Fabics v. City of New Brunswick, 629 F. App'x 196, 198 (3d Cir. 2015) ("'As part of its general power to administer its docket,' a district court may dismiss a duplicative complaint.") (quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); Walton v. Eaton Corp., 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir.1977) (en banc) (prohibiting a plaintiff from "maintain[ing] two separate actions involving the same subject matter at the
