ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time that the Veteran filed an August 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) to appeal the issue of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability, the same issue was pending review before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under Higher-Level Review.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 1972 to January 1975.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

The Board recognizes that the Veteran had appealed his claims for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, entitlement to a temporary total disability evaluation based on the need for convalescence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer, and entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) for loss of use of a creative organ.  These issues had been on appeal under the legacy system, but the Veteran opted into the AMA by filing an August 2024 VA Form 10182 after a July 2024 supplemental statement of the case had been issued.  Subsequently, in a December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for erectile dysfunction and SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ.  Thus, these issues have been resolved by a full grant of benefits, and thus they are no longer part of the current appeal.  Additionally, in the same rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for prostate cancer and assigned a 100 percent evaluation from March 7, 2012 to January 10, 2013.  (Parenthetically, after finding clear and unmistakable error in its December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ corrected the Veteran's effective date for his 100 percent evaluation for prostate cancer and assigned his 100 percent evaluation from March 7, 2012 until February 1, 2013.).  The Veteran's claim for a temporary total disability evaluation based on the need for convalescence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer was based on a July 2012 surgery.  An award of a temporary total evaluation based on the need for convalescence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer would have afforded him a total evaluation for a three-month period from August 1, 2012 to November 1, 2012 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.  Because the Veteran has already been awarded a total evaluation for his prostate cancer that encompasses the period for which he was seeking a temporary total evaluation, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a temporary total evaluation based on the need for convalescence following surgical treatment for prostate cancer has been granted in full, and thus, this issue is no longer part of the current appeal.  

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran was previously represented by Disabled American Veterans.  The record shows that in November 2024 the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a in favor of an agent.  The Board recognizes this change in representation.

1. The appeal for entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability

Under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a claimant may generally seek one of three available administrative review options by filing the appropriate form following adjudication of a claim.  The three review options available are: (1) higher-level review, (2) supplemental claim, and (3) Board review.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

However, under the AMA, concurrent election is prohibited, meaning that once a Veteran has filed for review under one lane (i.e., higher-level review, supplemental claim, Board review), he cannot seek review under a different lane while adjudication is pending in the previously selected lane.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

Following review of the available documents in the claims file, the present appeal must be dismissed as a concurrent election of review options is prohibited.  

In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability.  In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability.  Two days after receiving notification of the rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 (Higher-Level Review) seeking review of the January 2024 rating decision.  In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher-level review of the claim for a right shoulder disability.  While the Veteran's higher-level review was pending, he filed an August 2024 VA Form 10182 under the Direct Review docket seeking to appeal to the Board the issue of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151for a right shoulder disability in the January 2024 rating decision.  The Board accepted the August 2024 VA Form 10182 and docketed the present appeal.  See August 2024 AMA Notification Letter. 

A review of the above procedural history shows that a concurrent election of review options occurred when the Veteran submitted a January 2024 Higher-Level Review request and while that review option remained pending (i.e., unadjudicated at the AOJ), a VA Form 10182 pertaining to the same issue was submitted in August 2024.  As concurrent elections are prohibited, the Board finds that the present appeal stream must be dismissed. 

Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized VA's prohibition against concurrent election, holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option."  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023).  The Court's holding in Terry was expressly predicated on finding that multiple review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a).  Id. at 4.  As such, the Court's holding in Terry makes clear that only one review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues, due to the prohibition against concurrent election.  Id. at 14.

The Board may dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have the ability to review the appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(a).  When the Board cannot dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction in certain instances, it can still consider dismissing the appeal for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect.  See generally Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  Here, as the present appeal was docketed following an impermissible concurrent election for the issue of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability, this appeal must be dismissed as a matter of law due to the procedural defect.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). 

Nevertheless, the Board recognizes that the dismissal of this appeal does not disadvantage the Veteran as the issue of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability was addressed on higher-level review by the AOJ in an August 2024 rating decision.  The one-year period from the date of the notification of the August 2024 rating decision for electing one of the administrative review options (higher-level review, supplemental claim, or Board appeal) by filing the appropriate form has not yet expired; thus, the Veteran can still continue to pursue his original claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a right shoulder disability if he files the appropriate form before the expiration of the one-year period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.
