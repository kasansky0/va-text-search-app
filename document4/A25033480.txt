CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to basic eligibility to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 of Title 38 of the United States Code have been met. 10 U.S.C. § 16132; 38 U.S.C. § 3012; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.7520, 21.7540, 21.7550.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1987 to July 1992.  Thereafter, the Veteran served uninterruptedly in the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve (Selected Reserve)  from July 1992 to May 2000.  And since July 31, 2024, the Veteran continues to serve in the Air Force Reserve. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2023  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office decision that denied entitlement to Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits on the basis that the Veteran failed to resume to actively drilling with the Air National Guard within the authorized time limit. 

In the May 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

In a recent decision under Docket No. 230410-341834, the Board dismissed the Veteran's appeal with respect to a previous March 2023 decision that found the Veteran eligible to Chapter 1606 benefits but to less than 36 months of entitlement.  The appeal was dismissed on the basis that the April 2023 decision, addressed herein, overrode the previous decision by removing in full the Veteran's basic eligibility to education benefits under Chapter 1606.  However, the Board has reestablished the Veteran's basic eligibility to educational assistance benefits Chapter 1606.  If after the implementation of the present award the Veteran is granted benefits partially (i.e., less than 36 months), the Board invites her, if she wishes, to file a new claim on a VA prescribed form to address whether entitlement to 36 months of educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 is warranted.     

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

Entitlement to basic eligibility to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 

The Veteran contends that entitlement to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 for service in the Selected Reserve is warranted.   

Chapter 1606 is an educational assistance program for members of the Selected Reserve of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, and the Army and Air National Guard. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7520.  The applicable statute provides that "[a]t the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense shall transmit a notice of entitlement for each such person to that Secretary." 10 U.S.C. § 16132(c).  The implementing regulation provides that the Armed Forces will decide whether a reservist has met all the eligibility criteria needed in order to receive educational assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606.  In other words, the Reserve components decide who is eligible for the program; VA administers and makes the payments for the program. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540. 

Under Chapter 1606, a reservist initially becomes eligible when he or she enlists, reenlists, or extends an enlistment as a reservist so that the total period of obligated service is at least 6 years from the date of such enlistment, reenlistment, or extension. 10 U.S.C. § 16132(a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540(a)(1)(i).  The basic eligibility date is the date on which service commences for the contracted 6-year period.  

A review of the record shows that following her release from active duty in July 1992, the Veteran reenlisted in the Wyoming ANG for 6 years on July 16, 1992.   The Veteran extended her reenlistment  for an additional 4 years on May 14, 1994, for a total aggregate period of 10 years.  On October 12, 1997, the ANG transferred the Veteran to the United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) for the remainder of her contract.   The Veteran was separated from service on May 13, 2000, after approximately 8 years of service with the Selected Reserve and fulfillment of her contracts.   A Retirement Points Report generated on May 16, 2000, reflects that the Veteran served uninterruptedly from July 16, 1992 through May 13, 2000, and received retirement points for such service.  In other words, the record shows that the Veteran did not have a single period of absence from an actively drilling status at any time during her service.  The Veteran reenlisted in the United States Air Force Reserve for an additional 6 years on July 31, 2014.  

In January and March 2023, the Veteran submitted applications (VA Forms 22-1990) for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606.  A VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) report generated in March 2023 shows that the Veteran's eligibility to Chapter 1606 was first established on May 14, 1994, and most recently on July 31, 2014, by virtue of her 6-year reenlistment in 2014.    

On March 21, 2023, the AOJ contacted the Department of the Air Force Reserve to obtain information regarding the Veteran's eligibility.   The AOJ indicated that the Veteran previously received Chapter 1606 benefits based off service period from May 14, 1994 through October 12, 1997, with the ANG before enlisting into the Air Force Reserve on July 31, 2014.  The AOJ asked to "please verify claimant properly" regarding her affiliation and her retention of eligibility.  The next day, the Department of the Air Force replied that the Veteran is "1606 Eligible with effective date 31 Jul 2014. No Kicker updated on records."  

The AOJ again contacted the Department of the Air Force Reserve on April 19, 2023, to verify the Veteran's eligibility.  This time, the AOJ indicated the following: "Member appears to have established eligibility in 1994 and eligibility subsequently terminated in 1997.  Previous responses indicate member was granted a second period of eligibility in 2014 despite failure to reaffiliate within the authorized period."  See Air Force Reserve Request Receipt DOD-127066, dated April 19, 2023.  

On April 24, 2023, the Department of the Air Force replied that the Veteran "is eligible for 1606 effective 31 July 2014."

Notwithstanding the eligibility confirmations received by the service department on March 22 and April 24, 2023, with respect to the Veteran's eligibility to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606, in its April 2023 decision, the AOJ notified the Veteran that according to VA records, she stopped drilling in the ANG and transferred to the Air Force Reserve effective October 11, 1997.  Then she completely separated from the Air Force Reserve effective May 13, 2000, and did not reaffiliate with the Air Force Reserve in an actively drilling status until July 31, 2014.  

The AOJ explained that per DoDI 1322.17, Enclosure 3, Paragraph 4, an individual is authorized one period of absence from an actively drilling status during their Chapter 1606 entitlement period, which includes transfers to the Individual Ready Reserve.  This absence may not exceed three years for a missionary obligation and one year in all other circumstances. The AOJ concluded that the Veteran's eligibility was terminated retroactively, effective October 11, 1997, when she failed to resume actively drilling with the ANG within the authorized time limit and per the DoDI, once eligibility has been terminated, any future entitlement under the Chapter 1606 program is also permanently terminated.   

The Board has considered the evidence of record and for the reasons set forth below, finds that the Veteran is entitled to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606.  

First, it appears that the AOJ based its conclusion on inaccurate or incomplete information.  According to the April 2023 decision, the Veteran stopped drilling in the ANG and transferred to the Air Force Reserve effective October 11, 1997.  Because she failed to resume active drilling "with the ANG within the authorized time limit" set forth by DoDI 1322.17, her entitlement was terminated retroactively on October 11, 1997.  

However, as shown by the service personnel records discussed above, particularly the May 16, 2000 Retirement Points Report, the Veteran never stopped her active drilling status but was transferred to the Air Force Reserve on October 12, 1997, another component of the Selected Reserve, to fulfill her enlistment contract.  The Reserve Orders No. CA-011441, issued on May 13, 2000, are probative evidence to that effect.  

Additionally, in her May 2023 NOD, the Veteran explained that her ANG unit, the "136 SPS Navy Dallas" was "disbanded" on October 11, 1997.  While the evidence of record does not clarify whether the Veteran's transfer from the ANG to the Air Force Reserve occurred by virtue of the elimination of her ANG unit on that date, the Board still finds that the Veteran's Selected Reserve service, comprised of service in both the ANG and the Air Force Reserve, continued from July 1992 to May 2000, for a total of more than 6 years.  

Although the AOJ found that the Veteran's Selected Reserve service was from May 1994 to October 1997, the additional evidence of record, in the form of service personnel records, show that her Selected Reserve service in fact continued uninterruptedly from July 16, 1992, to May 13, 2000, a little less than 8 years, without any absence in between.  Thus, the first statutory and regulatory requirement for basic eligibility to Chapter 1606 benefits, that is, that "the total period of obligated service" is at least 6 years from the date of such enlistment, reenlistment, or extension, has been met. 10 U.S.C. § 16132(a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540(a)(1)(i).  

Since the Veteran fulfilled her contact obligation (i.e., that the total period of obligated service is at least 6 years), the Board finds that the provisions set forth by DoDI 1322.7, Enclosure 3, Paragraph 4, are not applicable to the facts of this case.  

Thus, the Board finds no legal basis to consider the Veteran's initial basic eligibility stemming from her service from July 1992 to May 2000 as terminated.  

Second, the Veteran's reenlistment in the Air Force Reserve effective July 31, 2014, established a new period of eligibility effective on that date since the Veteran reenlisted as a Reservist for service in the Selected Reserve for a period of not less than six years.  10 U.S.C. § 16132(a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540(a)(1)(i).  This is not only confirmed by the March 2023 VADIR report showing her basic eligibility established, again, on July 31, 2014, but was confirmed on two separate instances by the Department of the Air Force in response to the AOJ's detailed requests in March and April 2023.  On both occasions, the service department confirmed that the Veteran is eligible to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 effective July 31, 2014.  

Here, on behalf of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the AOJ requested confirmation from the Department of the Air Force as to whether the Veteran was entitled to the benefit sought by pointing out what VA understood were potentially applicable scenarios disentitling the Veteran from further education benefits under the program.  The service department transmitted notices of entitlement in March and April 2023, confirming eligibility for the Veteran. 10 U.S.C. § 16132(c).  Service department findings (i.e., the Army, Navy, and Air Force) are binding on VA for purposes of establishing an individual's service.  As noted above, the Reserve components decide who is eligible for the Chapter 1606 benefits.  VA does not have the authority to alter the findings of the service department. 10 U.S.C. § 16132; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.203(a), 21.7540(a); see also Spencer v. West, 13 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000).  Here, despite the AOJ's explanation of what they mistakenly believed terminated the Veteran's eligibility effective October 11, 1997, the Air Force Reserve concluded in its first response, and reiterated on its second response that the Veteran met all the eligibility criteria needed in order to receive educational assistance under Chapter 1606. 

In light of the above, the Board finds that entitlement to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 1606 is warranted by virtue of the Veteran's reenlistment in the Air Force Reserve for a period of at least 6 years effective July 31, 2014, a matter confirmed by her service department.  The appeal is granted.
