REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a separately claimed mental health disability of depression, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a separately claimed mental health disability of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from April 2019 to November 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

By way of procedural background related to the instant claims, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in March 2023, for service connection of PTSD and anxiety, which had previously been denied in a December 2022 rating decision. See March 2023, VA Form 20-0995. In an April 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder, with a 30 percent disability rating, effective as of November 28, 2022. See April 2023, Rating Decision. That same rating decision denied service connection for the separately identified claims of depression and PTSD. Id. In October 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), and elected the Evidence Submission Docket. Approximately 12 days later, and prior to the docketing of the appeal at the Board, the Veteran filed an additional supplemental claim, again separately claiming service connection for depression and PTSD. See October 16, 2023, VA Form 20-0995. The AOJ began developing the claim pursuant to the October 2023 supplemental claim. See October 20, 2023, Subsequent Development Letter. The appeal with the Board was docketed on October 25, 2023. See October 2023, Docketing Letter. 

In March 2024, the rating decision on appeal was issued (pursuant to the filing of the October 2023 supplemental claim and subsequent development), again denying the claims of service connection for depression and PTSD. The Veteran filed another supplemental claim on April 20, 2024. See April 20, 2024, VA Form 20-0995. As a result of the April 2024 supplemental claim, an August 2024 rating decision was issued, continuing the denial of the claims. See August 2024, Rating Decision. 

In September 2024, the Veteran filed the NOD giving rise to the instant appeal and electing the Direct Review Docket. See September 2024, VA Form 10182. Later that same month, the appeal was docketed. See September 30, 2024, Docketing Letter. 

Notably, there are two appeals before the Board addressing the issues at hand. However, they are separately docketed and filed pursuant to distinct appellate review lanes and subject to separate evidentiary windows for consideration. As the October 2023 NOD initiated a separate appeal stream which is not presently before the Board, the Board makes no finding as to the propriety of the docketing of that appeal. However, it is noted that the concurrent election of separate reviews is precluded under the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (holding that under the modernized review system, a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial agency decision, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request.). 

Nevertheless, the Board finds that the Veteran would be negatively prejudiced at this stage of the proceedings by a finding that the October 2023 supplemental claim was improperly filed, given the additional development and procedural progression that has ensued therefrom. Accordingly, to the extent that the September 2024 NOD appealed the March 2024 rating decision, the Board finds that the appeal is properly before the Board. 

Given the Veteran's election of the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection - Depression and PTSD

The Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. 

The Veteran has maintained that he has separately diagnosed disabilities of depression and PTSD, which are not encompassed within the already granted claim for service connection of unspecified anxiety disorder. Because separately diagnosed psychiatric disorders may be service connected, as distinct disabilities and subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for depression and PTSD remain on appeal. See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Turning to the evidence of record, a November 2023 VA examination report provides a diagnosis of PTSD. However, a nexus opinion is not provided. That same report includes a finding that the Veteran does not have a separate diagnosis of depression, but that depression is merely a symptom of the diagnosed PTSD. See November 2023, VA Examination Report. The AOJ requested an addendum opinion, as the November 2023 VA report did not specify whether the diagnosis of PTSD was a separate diagnosis from the already-service-connected mental health disability, or a progression thereof. See February 2024, Exam Request. 

An additional VA mental health opinion was obtained in March 2024. Significantly, this opinion was provided from a different physician. In the March 2024 report, which was based upon a review of the records, it was opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. See March 2024, VA Examination Report.

Despite the two contradicting reports, the AOJ did not obtain further clarification or provide the Veteran with the opportunity for an additional examination. In addition, the Board also finds that the March 2024 report is inadequate as it fails to address the positive opinion of record, as well as the VA treatment records which demonstrate diagnoses of PTSD and depression, and reflect treatment for both mental health conditions. See 2023-2024, VA Treatment Records. 

Given the inadequacy of the VA examination reports of record available for the Board's review, a remand is necessary to correct these pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors and afford the Veteran proper due-process of his claims. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his claimed depression and PTSD disabilities. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated tests and studies must be performed.

Based on the examination of the Veteran and a review of the record, including consideration of the PTSD and depression diagnoses contained within the treatment records, the examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed disabilities of depression and PTSD are separately diagnosable disabilities etiologically related to the claimed in-service incident or stressor. In forming the opinion, the examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of his symptoms.

A complete and detailed rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed.
