ORDER

Entitlement to a 50 percent rating for nonspecific headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

During the appeal period, the Veteran's headaches were characterized by very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for 50 percent rating nonspecific headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.214a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2001 to December 2002.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial ratings assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Increased rating for nonspecific headaches 

The Veteran's headache is rated under DC 8100 analogous to migraine headaches.  DC 8100 provides that migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability are rated at 50 percent.  Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months are rated at 30 percent.  Migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months are rated at 10 percent.  Migraine headaches with less frequent attacks are rated at 0 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating."  The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" means attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).  In other words, the term "prostrating" takes on its plain meaning of "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low."  Id.  However, "prostration" can be defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1531 (32nd ed. 2012).  The term "productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing.  Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004).

When considering a disability rating, the Board must not consider the ameliorative effects of medication unless those effects are explicitly contemplated by the relevant rating criteria.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012).  In this case, DC 8100 does not mention the effects of medication.  Thus, the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medications are not for consideration in rating his headache pathology.

The February 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for nonspecific headaches and assigned a 0 percent rating from October 2022.  A May 2024 rating decision granted a 30 percent rating from September 2023.  The Board's review is limited to evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 rating decision as well as any argument in support of the appeal. 

A VA treatment record dated in February 2020 noted a complaint of intractable headache, unspecified chronicity pattern.  The Veteran reported he had migraine-type headache for five days and reported that his headaches woke him up intermittently.  

A November 2022 VA examination reflects a diagnosis of nonspecific headaches.  The Veteran reported treatment with Motrin.  The examination noted pain on both sides of the head.  His non-headache symptoms included sensitivity to light.  The duration of head pain was less than one day.  The pain was located on both sides of the head.  The examination indicated that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks.  The VA examination noted that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain.  The VA examiner noted that headaches did not impact the Veteran's ability to work.

In a January 2025 statement, The Veteran stated that he has daily headaches that last 30 minutes to all day. He stated the headaches are debilitating.  The Veteran stated that he has daily headaches that last 30 minutes to all day. He stated the headaches are debilitating. He indicated that the headaches would prevent him from working. When he has a headache, he has to lie down and cannot think straight. He indicated that he is sensitive to both light and sound and that his headaches affect his ability to function at home and at his jobs.

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms that he has observed through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). He is competent to report the character and duration of headache symptoms.  Review of the record shows that the Veteran has almost daily headaches ranging from 30 minutes to all day.  Additionally, the treatment records proximate to his claim show that he reported intractable headache for several days had that kept him awake.  The Board finds that the medical records and lay evidence establishes that his headaches that are very frequent and completely prostrating with prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Accordingly, a 50 percent rating is warranted for his headache disability.  This is the maximum rating available under DC 8100.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
