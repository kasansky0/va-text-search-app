REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence shows that the Veteran's lacunar infarcts/stroke was caused by his service-connected hypertension.

2. The evidence shows that the Veteran's major vascular neurocognitive disorder is caused by his service-connected lacunar infarcts/stroke and hypertension. 

3. The Veteran originally filed a claim of service connection for ischemic heart disease in July 2012; a September 2013 rating decision denied service connection for ischemic heart disease; the Veteran did not initiate an appeal with that rating decision within one year of the September 2013rating decision notice, and no new and material evidence pertinent to the claim was received within the one-year appeal period, nor were additional, relevant service records, warranting reconsideration of the claim, received at any time thereafter.  

4. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) received the Veteran's complete VA Form 21-526EZ for the service connection claims for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease on June 21, 2022 within one year of receipt of an intent to file claim form on June 26, 2021 and the Veteran continuously pursued the claim until the service connection claim for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) was granted in the October 25, 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

5. During the appeal period from August 10, 2022, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more and the Veteran did not both have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and require continuous medication for control.

6. During the appeal period from October 25, 2023, the evidence shows that the Veteran's arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) is not manifested by metabolic equivalent (MET) testing at a workload of 5.0 METs or less resulting in symptoms of congestive heart failure.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force with active duty from September 1967 to May 1971.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 28, 2024 higher-level review rating decision and rating decisions dated August 26, 2024 and October 30, 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the February 28, 2024 higher-level review rating decision, the AOJ denied a compensable disability rating for hypertension and an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  In the August 26, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a stroke and granted service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and assigned a 30 percent disability rating, effective from October 25, 2023).  In the October 30, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for major vascular neurocognitive disorder (claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD))

In February 2025, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement.  The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  In the February 2025 VA Form 10182 and in a letter submitted with the VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney waived any additional time within which to modify the chosen Board appeal lane.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Thus, the Board will proceed with adjudicating the claims on appeal.

Regarding the Veteran's initial rating and earlier effective date claims for hypertension, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 13, 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

With respect to the remaining issues on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 26, 2024 rating decision on appeal for the issues of entitlement to service connection for stroke, an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) and an effective date earlier than October 23, 2022 for the grant of service connection or at the time of the October 31, 2024 rating decision on appeal for entitlement to service connection for major vascular neurocognitive disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that with respect to the remand for entitlement to an effective date prior August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension, if the AOJ ends up granting an earlier effective date for the grant of hypertension, this decision does not preclude the Veteran from appealing the initial rating assigned for the period prior to August 10, 2022.  

Similarly, in this decision, the Board has granted an earlier effective date of June 26, 2021 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).  The AOJ will assign an initial rating for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) from June 26, 2021 through October 24, 2023 and this decision does not preclude the Veteran from appealing the initial rating assigned by the AOJ in the first instance prior to October 25, 2023.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of the following: (1) A current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) nexus between the claimed in-service disease and the present disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

Service connection also may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Similarly, any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, will be service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for lacunar infarcts/stroke as secondary to service-connected hypertension.

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for lacunar infarcts and strokes as an examiner provided a positive nexus opinion between this disability and his service-connected hypertension.  See February 2025 Notice of Disagreement.  

An April 2024 VA examination shows that the Veteran has a current disability of lacunar infarcts, and in April 2024 the VA examiner provided the opinion that the Veteran's hypertension is the most likely cause of the Veteran's lacunar infarcts/strokes.  The April 2024 VA examination explained that the Veteran had been diagnosed with hypertension for years and that in 2010 he developed elevated uncontrolled high blood pressure.  In 2019 the Veteran was diagnosed with a subdural hematoma, which is a brain bleed, caused by a fall while he was admitted to a medical facility.  While the subdural hematoma was due to the trauma of the fall, imaging of the brain revealed chronic lacunar infarcts, small brain bleeds usually associated with hypertension.  Hypertension is the most important risk factor for infarcts or strokes, and it is the most likely cause for the Veteran's diagnosis of lacunar infarcts/stroke. While toxic exposure has been considered and herbicide exposure is conceded, the Veteran's claimed condition of stroke, noted to be lacunar infarct diagnosis is proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.  This medical opinion is probative as to whether the Veteran's current lacunar infarcts/stroke are caused by the Veteran's service-connected hypertension because the examiner provided a clear rationale based on the Veteran's medical records and medical literature.  It is also persuasive that there is no competent medical opinion to the contrary.

In conclusion, the competent and persuasive medical evidence shows that the Veteran's current lacunar infarcts/strokes are proximately due to service-connected hypertension.  Accordingly, after resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for lacunar infarcts/stroke is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102."

2. Entitlement to service connection for major vascular neurocognitive disorder as secondary to service-connected hypertension and lacunar infarcts/stroke.

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for major vascular neurocognitive disorder as an October 2024 examiner provided a positive nexus opinion between this disability and his service-connected hypertension and strokes.  See February 2025 Notice of Disagreement.  

An October 2024 VA examination shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of major vascular neurocognitive disorder, and in October 2024 a psychiatrist provided a VA opinion that the Veteran's major vascular neurocognitive disorder is at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of service-connected condition.  The psychiatrist explained that the diagnosis of major or mild vascular neurocognitive disorder requires the establishment of a neurocognitive disorder (Criterion A) and the determination that cerebrovascular disease is the dominant if not exclusive pathology that accounts for the cognitive deficits.  Vascular etiology may range from large vessel stroke to microvascular disease; the presentation is therefore very heterogeneous, stemming from the types of vascular lesions and their extent and location.  Vascular disease is the second most common cause of neurocognitive disease after Alzheimer's disease.  The major risk factors for major or mild vascular neurocognitive disease are the same as those for cerebrovascular disease and stroke, including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, high homocysteine levels, other risk factors for atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions increasing the risk of cerebral emboli.  Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, leading to cerebral hemorrhage, is an important risk factor in which amyloid deposits occur within arterial vessels.  This medical opinion is probative as to whether the Veteran's current major vascular neurocognitive disorder is caused by the Veteran's service-connected hypertension and lacunar infarcts/stroke because the examiner provided a clear rationale based on the Veteran's medical records and medical literature.  It is also persuasive that there is no competent medical opinion to the contrary.

In conclusion, the competent and persuasive medical evidence shows that the Veteran's current major vascular neurocognitive disorder is proximately due to service-connected hypertension and lacunar infarcts/stroke.  Accordingly, after resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for major vascular neurocognitive disorder is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102."

Earlier Effective Dates

3. Entitlement to an effective prior to October 25, 2023 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to October 25, 2023 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).  He did not provide any argument or statement in support of this contention.  

Generally, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim of service connection shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of the receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  See also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002).  The effective date of an award of service connection shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), a claimant may submit a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC ("Intent to File" form), and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) ("Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form... [for the] benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.").  An intent to file claim can be submitted in three ways: saved electronic application, written intent on prescribed intent to file a claim form, and oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3.155(b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii).  If not on a standardized Intent to File form, then any communication "is considered a request for an application form for benefits" and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received.  Id. at § 3.155(a).  An Intent to File is "active" for the purpose of assigning an earlier effective date of entitlement until the earlier of the following either VA receives a substantially complete application for benefits for the same type of benefit identified on the Intent to File, or the one-year period following VA's receipt of the communication of the Intent to File ends.

The preamble under the current version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 specifically excludes supplemental claims from the intent to file framework.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated the portion of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent to file framework.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 excluding supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework is invalid for contravening the unambiguous meaning of their governing statutory provisions).

For claims within VA's modernized AMA review system, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the appropriate administrative review options, to include a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board, following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the statute or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  In other words, the effective date of service connection cannot occur prior to when all of the elements of service connection have been met.

The evidence shows that the Veteran originally filed a service connection claim for ischemic heart disease in July 2012.  A September 2013 rating decision denied service connection for ischemic heart disease on the basis that the persuasive evidence did not show that the Veteran had a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease.  Although notified of the denial in a September 2013 letter sent to his then current address of record, the Veteran did not initiate an appeal with that rating decision within one year of the rating decision notice.  Moreover, no new and material evidence pertinent to the claim was received within the one-year appeal period, nor were additional, relevant service records, warranting reconsideration of the claim, received at any time thereafter.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), (c).

The first communication following the September 2013 final rating decision indicating an intent to file a claim of service connection for heart disease was received on June 26, 2021.  On June 26, 2021, the AOJ received a completed VA Form 21-0996, Intent to File.  In a June 2021 letter, the AOJ informed the Veteran that the AOJ had received the intent to file form and that if his completed application is received within one year of the intent to file, he may be compensated from the date of receipt of the intent to file.  The AOJ also informed the Veteran to begin processing his claim for compensation, he must complete, sign, and return a VA Form 21-526EZ.  On June 21, 2022, the AOJ received a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits that included a service connection claim for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease.  In June 2022, the AOJ sent a letter to the Veteran stating that the AOJ received mail indicating that he would like the AOJ to review claim for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease (previously claimed as ischemic heart disease) and that VA regulation requires that the request be filed on the proper form (in this case a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim).  On August 26, 2022, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim where he listed the issue as ischemic heart disease due to Agent Orange exposure and the date of VA decision notice as September 16, 2013. 

An April 2023 rating decision continued the denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease due to Agent Orange exposure.  In the April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable findings that he was exposed to Agent Orange in the military and that his personnel records confirm boots on the ground in the Republic of Vietnam.  In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ received a completed VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review for the Veteran's service connection claim for ischemic heart disease due to Agent Orange exposure and listed the April 13, 2023 rating decision.  A February 2024 higher-level review rating decision noted that the issue of ischemic heart disease was returned due to the need to obtain additional evidence to substantiate his claim.  In an August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) associated with TERA participation and assigned a 30 percent disability rating, effective from October 25, 2023.  It is unclear why the AOJ granted an effective date of October 25, 2023 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).

In this case, the evidence shows that an effective date of June 26, 2021 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) is warranted.  In this regard, the Veteran submitted an intent to file on June 26, 2021 and the AOJ received a completed VA Form 21-526EZ on June 21, 2021, which is within one year of receipt of the intent to file claim.  After the AOJ sent a letter to inform the Veteran that he submitted his service connection claim for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease on the wrong form and he needs to file it as a supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted a completed supplemental claim form on August 26, 2022.  The supplemental claim form was not received within one year of receipt of the Veteran's intent to file form.  Although the Veteran should have filed his service connection claim for ischemic heart disease on a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim as the claim had been previously denied by the AOJ in a final rating decision, the AOJ had informed the Veteran in a June 2021 letter that he needed to submit his claim on a VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran, who was considered pro se (i.e., not represented by an attorney) at that time, followed the directions provided by the AOJ.  Therefore, the Board will waive the claims processing error committed by the Veteran when he submitted the wrong claim form for the issue of entitlement to service connection for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease in June 2022.  After the AOJ denied the claim in an April 2023 rating decision, the Veteran continuously pursued the claim by filing a higher-level review in October 2023, within one year of the April 2023 rating decision.  After returning the claim for further development, the AOJ granted the Veteran's service connection claim for ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease) in the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  

Furthermore, an April 2024 VA examination documents that the Veteran was diagnosed with myocardial infarction in May 2019.  The April 2024 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran had coronary artery disease since 2010.  Private treatment records also show that the Veteran had a myocardial infarction in May 2019 and that he was being treated for coronary artery disease prior to June 2021.  Thus, the evidence shows that the Veteran had a history of myocardial infarction and a diagnosis of coronary artery disease at the time he filed the June 26, 2021 intent to file form.  

Finally, the AOJ granted the Veteran's service connection claim arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) based on toxic risk exposure activity during active duty service pursuant to the on August 10, 2022, the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins (PACT) Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which became effective on August 10, 2022.  For claims filed within a year of the PACT Act, the earliest effective date that can be assigned is August 10, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114. 

Nonetheless, the evidence shows that the Veteran's claim can also be granted based on the presumption of service connection due to exposure to herbicide agents including Agent Orange.  In this regard, to establish presumptive service connection for a disease associated with exposure to herbicide agents the evidence must show: (1) that the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962 and ending on May 7, 1975; (2) that he currently suffers from a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents enumerated under § 3.309(e); and (3) that the current disease process manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within the specific time period prescribed in § 3.307(a)(6)(ii).  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).  Ischemic heart disease (which includes acute, sub-acute, and old myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease) is listed under the diseases associated with herbicide exposure for purposes of the presumption.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  The Veteran is also currently in receipt of a 30 percent disability rating for ischemic heart disease.  Furthermore, the AOJ has made a favorable finding that the Veteran served in the Republic of Vietnam and his service personnel records reflect that he served in the Republic of Vietnam from June 1970 to May 1971.  Thus, the Veteran is entitled to service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) as a presumption of service connection due to exposure to herbicide agents to include Agent Orange.  

However, in granting an effective date of June 26, 2021 for the grant of service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), an effective date prior to June 26, 2021 is not warranted.  Specifically, the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran filed an informal claim for service connection for a cardiovascular disability to include coronary artery disease after the final September 2013 rating decision, which denied service connection for ischemic heart disease, and prior to March 24, 2015.  The evidence of record also does not reflect that the Veteran filed a formal claim for a cardiovascular disability to include coronary artery disease at any time between the final September 2013 rating decision and June 26, 2021.  

Furthermore, in cases involving presumptive service connection due to herbicide agent exposure, there is an exception to the provisions set forth above.  VA has promulgated special rules for the effective dates for the award of presumptive service connection based on exposure to herbicide agents, pursuant to orders of a United States District Court in the class action of Nehmer v. United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  38?C.F.R. §?3.816; see also Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration, 712 F. Supp. 1404?(N.D. Cal. 1989); Nehmer v. United States Veterans Administration,32 F. Supp. 2d. 1175 (N.D. Cal. 1999); Nehmer v. Veterans Administration of the Government of the United States, 284 F.3d 1158 (9th Cir. 2002).  The Nehmer litigation created an exception to the generally applicable effective date rules contained in 38?U.S.C. §?5110(g) and 38?C.F.R. §?3.114. 

Specifically, a Nehmer class member is defined as a Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease.  38?C.F.R. §?3.816(b)(1).  The Veteran is a Vietnam Era Veteran with verified service in the Republic of Vietnam.  Thus, the Veteran meets the criteria to be considered a Vietnam veteran as defined in the regulations.  38?C.F.R. §?3.307(a)(6).  A covered herbicide disease means a disease for which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a presumption of service connection pursuant to the Agent Orange Act of 1991, other than chloracne.  38?C.F.R. §?3.816(b)(2).  The effective date of the law which added ischemic heart disease as a disease presumptively due to in-service exposure to herbicides is August 10, 2010.  Accordingly, the Veteran is a Nehmer class member as defined in the law.

The regulation provides for situations where the effective date can be earlier than the date of the liberalizing law if a Nehmer class member has been granted compensation for a covered herbicide disease.  Either (1) VA denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989; or (2) the class member's claim for disability compensation for the covered herbicide disease was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between May 3, 1989, and the effective date of the statute or regulations establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered disease.  The effective date of the law which added ischemic heart disease as a disease presumptively due to in-service exposure to herbicides is August 10, 2010.  In these situations, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose.  38?C.F.R. § 3.816(c)(1), (c)(2).  If neither circumstance exists, the effective date of the award of service connection shall be determined in accordance with either 38?C.F.R. § 3.114 or § 3.400.  See 38?C.F.R. § 3.816(c)(4).

In this case, although the Veteran has been awarded service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) as a result of his exposure to certain herbicide agents in service, VA did not deny a claim for service connection for the Veteran's arteriosclerotic heart disease, coronary artery disease, or any other cardiac disability, between September 25, 1985, and May 3, 1989.  The Veteran did not have a service connection claim for a heart disability to include myocardial infarction or coronary artery disease pending before VA on May 3, 1989 and VA did not receive such claim between May 3, 1989, and August 21, 2010, the effective date of the statute or regulations establishing a presumption of service connection for ischemic heart disease.  Thus, an effective date prior to June 26, 2021 for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), in accordance with the liberalizing law based on the Nehmer guidelines is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816.

According to the applicable regulation, the effective date of the Veteran's grant for service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) should be no earlier than June 26, 2021; the date the AOJ first received the Veteran's intent to file claim for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disability since the final September 2013 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2) and (r).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  When the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran is accorded the benefit of the doubt.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  Furthermore, staged ratings are appropriate in any increased-rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms or differing levels of severity can be identified.  See Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for service-connected hypertension.

The Veteran contends that a higher initial rating is warranted for service-connected hypertension.  He has not provided any reason for his disagreement with the current noncompensable disability rating assigned for hypertension.

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

In rating hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101, the adjudicator may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and therefore Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) does not apply).  However, in Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021), the Court held "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a Veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent rating.  In this regard, the medical evidence shows that the Veteran's diastolic pressure is not predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more.  The medical evidence reflects that that the Veteran did not have any diastolic pressure readings of 100 or more or systolic pressure readings of 160 or more during the appeal period.  Furthermore, while the Veteran's hypertension requires continuous medication for control, he does not have a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more.  The medical evidence shows that out of approximately 98 blood pressure readings from 1971 through the present only four blood pressure readings reflect diastolic pressure of 100 or more. 

In conclusion, the persuasive evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's symptoms of hypertension do not warrant a compensable disability rating from August 10, 2022.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).  He has not provided any reason for his disagreement with current 30 percent disability rating assigned for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease).  

Arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7005.  A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control.  A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

One MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used.  Id.

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3).

Considering all relevant evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have a reduced METs level related to his service-connected arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), however, a March 2023 echocardiogram reveals cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dilation.  Specifically, an April 2024 VA examiner determined that that there are no current symptoms attributed to the Veteran's cardiac conditions.  The Veteran stated he sits up for 10 to 15 minutes to eat and then he is tired and he lays back down due to other conditions.  The examiner conducted an interview based METs test.  The examiner explained that exercise stress testing is not required as part of the Veteran's current treatment plan and this test is not without significant risk.  The examiner noted that the Veteran denied experiencing symptoms attributable to a cardiac condition with any level of physical activity.  The examiner documented that a March 2023 echocardiogram shows that there is evidence of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dilatation.  As the medical evidence shows that the Veteran does not have heart failure symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, syncope, or other symptoms) associated with his service-connected arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), the Veteran does not meet the requirements of a 60 percent disability rating which requires workload of 3.1-5.0 METs that results in heart failure symptoms or a 100 percent disability rating which requires workload of 3.0 METs or less that results in heart failure symptoms.

In conclusion, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) from October 25, 2023.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension.

Remanding claims under the AMA review system is limited to instances of pre-decisional duty to assist errors and "correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension is remanded to satisfy a regulatory duty as the correction of the error has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's earlier effective date claim.  

In this regard, the Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  The evidence shows that the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim, on June 26, 2021.  The AOJ received the Veteran's completed VA Form 21-526EZ, in which he claimed service connection for hypertension, on June 21, 2022 within one year of the AOJ's receipt of the intent to file claim form.  Specifically, the Veteran listed the service connection claim as cardiovascular disease and noted that prior to his myocardial infarction in May 2019 that he had hypertension and atrial arrhythmias requiring cardioversion and noted that he was exposed to Agent Orange during service in Vietnam.  Thus, the June 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ included the service connection claim for hypertension.  In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for hypertension and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective from August 10, 2022 pursuant to the PACT Act

As relevant to this case, on August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the PACT Act.  The PACT Act established a presumption for service connection for hypertension for Veterans who were exposed to herbicide agents.  For claims filed within a year of the PACT Act, the earliest effective date that can be assigned is August 10, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  However, in this case, an earlier effective date may be warranted if the grant is based on another theory of entitlement, such as direct service connection.  At the time of the April 13, 2023 rating decision, the evidence showed that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension and he was presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents to include Agent Orange due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  However, the Veteran was not afforded a VA medical opinion regarding the etiology of his hypertension.  Prior to August 10, 2022, VA did not concede that there was a relationship between hypertension and Agent Orange; however, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute of Medicine's Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 11 (2018) documents that after an examination of the literature that had been previously reviewed with additional new evidence, the committee determined that there is sufficient evidence of an association between hypertension and at least one of the chemicals of interest.  As there is an indication of an association between hypertension and exposure to Agent Orange, the low threshold to obtain a VA medical opinion on a direct basis for the Veteran's service connection claim for hypertension has been met.  If the evidence shows a grant of service connection for hypertension is warranted on a direct basis, then there is reasonable possibly that the effective date for the grant of his service connection claim for hypertension can go back to the date the AOJ received the Veteran's intent to file form that was received on June 26 2021.  

Thus, remand is required to obtain a medical opinion addressing the question of whether there is an etiological link between the Veteran's current hypertension and his exposure to herbicide agents to include Agent Orange.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's hypertension is, at least as likely as not (the likelihood is approximately evenly balanced, or nearly equal if not higher), that the Veteran's hypertension is due to disease or injury in service, including, but not limited to, his presumed exposure to in-service herbicides, for the period on appeal prior to the effective date of the PACT Act (prior to August 10, 2022).

Only provide an examination if one is deemed necessary by the medical professional.

The contents of the entire, electronic claims file to include a complete copy of this REMAND, must be made available to the medical professional, and the medical opinion report should reflect full consideration of the Veteran's documented medical history and lay assertions.

A complete, clearly stated rationale for the conclusions reached-to include identification of evidence and medical authority relied upon-must be provided.  The medical specialist should discuss the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Institute of Medicine's Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 11, Chapter 10 Metabolic and Cardiovascular Disorders (2018) and all other medical literature and/or studies used in offering his or her opinion.
