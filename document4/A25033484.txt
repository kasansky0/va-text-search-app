DOCKET NO. 240703-453295
DATE:    April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of increased ratings for posttraumatic stress disorder with major depressive disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, sprained right ankle with degenerative joint disease, boxer fracture right ring finger with residuals, and left long finger with residuals, as well as an increased rating and earlier effective date for bilateral pes planus, and an effective date for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability prior to December 23, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 5, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his then-representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service in the United States Army from January 2001 to December 2004.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In the present case, the Veteran, through his then-representative, has withdrawn his appeal in this case. The withdrawal document included the Veteran's name, VA claims number, and a statement that specifically withdrew each of the issues in this this Appeals Modernization Act docket. Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
