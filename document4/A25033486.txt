ORDER

New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

The issue of whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is dismissed.

Service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence added to the record after the May 2021 rating decision is new and relevant as it tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  

2. The award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death renders moot the issue of whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to DIC benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.

3. Affording the Appellant the benefit of the doubt, the Veteran's fatal overdose was a result of his service-connected psychiatric disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudicating the claim of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C.       § 1318 have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. The criteria for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1969 to January 1973, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam from August 1971 to June 1972.  The Veteran unfortunately died in June 2020.  The Appellant is the Veteran's spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2021 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), that adjudicated the Appellant's June 2021 supplemental claim.

In the September 2021 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket.  The Appellant and her mother testified at a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2025.  

The Appellant had initially filed her claim for DIC benefits in June 2020 which was denied in an October 2020 rating decision.  She then requested a Higher-Level Review in April 2021 which was denied in May 2021.  These claims have been continuously pursued since June 8, 2020.   

In June 2021, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death and entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 most recently addressed in a May 2021 rating decision.  In July 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or her representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

At the proceeding the Appellant waived the 90-day period following the appeal during which to submit additional evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.3000(b).  As such, and because the Board is granting the benefit sough on appeal, i.e., service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, which is the greater benefit than DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318, the Board will proceed to adjudicate this appeal. 

Petition to readjudicate a previously denied claim

For VA to readjudicate the claim, the Veteran must file "new and relevant" evidence. 38?C.F.R. §?3.156(d).  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. 38?C.F.R. §?3.2501 (a)(1).  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  New and relevant evidence received before VA issues its decision on a supplemental claim will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim.  Id.

After February 19, 2019, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim considering all the evidence of record.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  A supplemental claim can be filed by a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

New and relevant evidence may be submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b).

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death

The claim of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death was previously denied in an October 2020 rating decision. 

She timely submitted a Higher-Level Review in April 2021, and in a May 2021 rating decision, the RO again denied the Appellant's claim. 

In June 2021 the Appellant timely filed a Supplemental Review Claim.  In July 2021 the RO denied readjudication.  Because new and relevant evidence has since been submitted, this claim will be readjudicated.

In June 2021 the Appellant submitted a statement that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition worsened at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that he requested mental health services prior to his accidental overdose.  She also testified in April 2025 that he struggled with substance abuse as a form of medicating his psychiatric condition throughout their marriage. 

The Appellant's testimony is new because it was not part of the record in May 2021.  The evidence is also relevant, because it tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim, namely whether the Veteran's death was a result of his service-connected psychiatric condition. 

For these reasons, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been presented to readjudicate the Appellant's previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

Service Connection

In a claim of service connection for a veteran's cause of death, evidence must be presented that links the fatal disease to a period of military service or to an already service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.312. Evidence must be presented showing that a service-connected disability is either the principal or contributory cause of death.  38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.

For a service-connected disability to be the principal cause of death, it must singularly or jointly with some other condition be the immediate or underlying cause of death or be etiologically related thereto.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).  For a service-connected disability to be a contributory cause of death, it must be shown that it contributed substantially or materially, that it combined to cause death, or aided or lent assistance to the production of death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c).

As a general matter, establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

The Board must analyze the competency and credibility of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).  Competency is a legal concept - it means that the person or person who makes the statement is qualified by training, education, an occupation, personal experience, or other reason to make the statement.  Credibility is a factual determination - it involves deciding whether the testimony or other evidence is believable, and the determination is made after the evidence has been found competent.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death

The Appellant contends that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disabilities caused his accidental overdose.  As explained below, the Board agrees.

The Veteran died in June 2020.  The death certificate lists the immediate cause of death as acute combined toxic effects of methamphetamine, acetyl fentanyl, fentanyl and heroin with ANP present.  The record reflects that because an autopsy report was not available, VA medical personnel can only speculate as to what the acronym "ANP" refers.  

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities included anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS) (opioid use disorder and personality disorder NOS with antisocial features) evaluated as 30 percent disabling; coronary artery disease (CAD) with myocardial infarction (MI) evaluated as 60 percent disabling; diabetes mellitus type 2 evaluated as 20 percent disabling; peripheral neuropathy of all four extremities evaluated between 10 and 40 percent disabling; and noncompensable left ear hearing loss.

The Appellant testified that the Veteran's psychiatric condition stemmed from his traumatic experiences in combat.  She explained he had difficulty expressing himself to mental health professionals because he believed he would be legally prosecuted for the deaths he caused while serving in the Vietnam War.  She stated he told her his nightmares of combat service were so real he would wake up and still think he was back in Vietnam.  She further explained that when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the country, the Veteran was deeply concerned that his medical conditions of CAD and diabetes mellitus type 2 put him at a severe risk of death if he contracted COVID.  She said the anxiety of navigating the COVID pandemic led the Veteran to request VA mental health services in March 2020.  She noted that the request is listed in the Veteran's medical records but that no followup appointment or return call was made.  The Appellant testified the Veteran told her he felt himself "slipping" back into severe anxiety. 

Although there are two VA medical examinations against the claim, only the VA medical examination discussing the Veteran's psychiatric condition is relevant.  

In September 2020, a VA psychologist reviewed the Veteran's claims file and opined the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric evaluations did not indicate a causal or aggravating link between his service-connected psychiatric diagnosis of anxiety disorder NOS and his chronic polysubstance abuse.  The examiner noted the Veteran's medical records indicated his substance abuse was related to his pain management and not to his psychiatric symptoms.  Finally, the examiner noted the Veteran's anxiety disorder NOS was evaluated as "mild" and that therefore his psychiatric condition was unlikely to prompt a pattern of repeated substance abuse to alleviate his symptoms.  The examiner noted that it was unclear if the Veteran's opioid use disorder was part of his service-connected mental health condition. 

The Board finds the September 2020 VA psychologist's opinion inadequate under the unique circumstances and theories credibly advanced in this case.  

The Board notes that although the September 2020 VA psychologist's opinion focused primarily on the Veteran's anxiety disorder NOS diagnosis, the Veteran's code sheet reflects his service-connected psychiatric disability was expanded to include opioid use disorder and personality disorder NOS with antisocial features. See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991).  

Thus, the examiner's failure to mention whether the Veteran's opioid disorder or personality disorder NOS with antisocial features diagnoses caused or hastened his death did not properly consider the Veteran's full service-connected psychiatric condition. 

This case turns on a fact question regarding the cause of the Veteran's fatal accidental overdose.  The Board must perform its solemn obligation as factfinder.  The Appellant's testimony is found to be competent and credible.  See Schroeder v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 220 (1994); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009).  

The Board, in its role as a finder of fact, and affording the Appellant the benefit of the doubt, finds competent and credible the testimony of the Appellant and her mother as to the Veteran's use of drugs related to his service-connected psychiatric disability.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's fatal overdose was a result of his service-connected psychiatric disability.  Service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is warranted.  

2. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318

The Appellant submitted a claim based on 38 U.S.C. § 1318, as an alternative theory of entitlement to the service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  This claim underwent the same procedure history as her claim for entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, and the issue of whether new and relevant evidence was received to readjudicate this claim is now before the Board. 

In light of the grant of benefits described below, the Board concludes that the Appellant's appeal of whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 claim is rendered moot.  Indeed, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 2307, there are service-connected death burial benefits that are available under 38 U.S.C. § 1310, but not under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.  See Mintz v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?277, 282-83 (1994); see also Moffitt v. Brown, 10?Vet. App.?214, 224 (1997). 

Entitlement to VA benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 1310 is the greater benefit, and it is granted in full herein.  Therefore, no additional benefit (monetary or otherwise) can be gained under 38 C.F.R. § 1318, nor does any controversy remain.  See Hornick v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?50, 53-57 (2010); Timberlake v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?122 (2000).  Further, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has indicated that only if an Appellant's claim for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied under 38 U.S.C. § 1310 is VA required to also consider an appellant's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1318.  See Timberlake, 14 Vet. App. at 134-35. 

In light of the grant of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, the respective claim of whether readjudication of the claim for entitlement to DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is warranted is now moot. 

Accordingly, this claim is dismissed.
