REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for left foot hallux rigidus is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for right foot hallux rigidus is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Air Force Reserve from September 1986 to September 1996, during which he had active service from May 1987 to October 1987 and from September 1990 to July 1991.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that in the November 2024 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative challenged the competency of the January 2024 examiner and requested the examiner's curriculum vitae (CV). Under Francway v. Wilkie, 930 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2019), the Court has held that a Veteran is required to raise a specific challenge to the competency of a VA examiner before VA is required to respond with information about the qualifications of the examiner. The Federal Circuit has held that any challenge to the expertise of a VA expert must set forth the specific reasons why the litigant concludes that the expert is not qualified to give an opinion. Typically, a claimant must have the ability to secure from the VA the information necessary to raise the competency challenge. Once the request is made for information as to the competency of the examiner, a claimant normally has the right, absent unusual circumstances, to the curriculum vitae and other information about the qualifications of a medical examiner. This is mandated by the VA's duty to assist. Francway, 930 F.3d at 1308. 

However, pursuant to the provisions of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board reviews the record only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). In this case, the AMA rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024, with an examination pertaining to the issue on appeal occurring prior to the rating decision. Because the request was received after the March 2024 rating decision, the failure to provide the VA examiner's qualifications to the Veteran does not represent a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Further, the duty to assist does not attach at the Board level in an AMA appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c). In addition, there was no error in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) because, absent a request prior to the rating decision on appeal, there could not have been an error. Therefore, remand is not appropriate for this request, and no further action is warranted as to this matter.

1. Service connection for left foot hallux rigidus.

2. Service connection for right foot hallux rigidus.

The Veteran contends his bilateral hallux rigidus began on active duty and was caused by wearing boots on the flight line. See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  

In November 2023 VA contacted the Veteran regarding his claim. The Veteran reported that he experienced pain in his big toes while on active duty but that he ignored the pain. The Veteran again stated that he believes the pain is due to wearing boots while on active duty. The Veteran also reported that he has seen a doctor about his toe pain, who suggested that surgery is the only way pain will go away. See November 2023 VA 27-0820 Report of General Information.

A January 2024 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) indicates that a VA examiner provided a records-reviewed examination. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral hallux rigidus. In the medical history section of the DBQ, the examiner said the condition began shortly after the Veteran's military career. The examiner stated that the Veteran has not been treated for this condition. See January 2024 DBQ. The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion. The examiner reasoned that while the claimed condition is alleged to have occurred in service, the Veteran's medical records do not confirm that the condition occurred in service. The examiner said the condition was not present on the Veteran's entrance or exit examinations and that the condition was not identified in the Veteran's service treatment records. The examiner stated the condition has been confirmed to exist post-service. See January 2024 Medical Opinion.    

The Board finds the January 2024 medical opinion to be inadequate. The rationale primarily focused on the lack of treatment records for the Veteran's toe pain during service. However, the fact that the record does not contain contemporaneous treatment for the Veteran's toe pain during service does not negate his competent and credible testimony of ongoing symptoms throughout his time in and since service. See Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991) (noting that "[t]he regulation requires continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment"); see also Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 496 (1997) (holding that "symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology"). Furthermore, the examiner did not address the Veteran's lay statements that wearing boots caused his toe pain. Lay evidence can be competent and credible, especially when it is consistent with the medical evidence. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In this case, the examiner's opinion does not explain why the Veteran's account of the injury and subsequent symptoms should be discounted.

Accordingly, the January 2024 VA medical opinion is inadequate to adjudicate the Veteran's appeal, as it improperly relied on a lack of contemporaneous treatment and failed to address the Veteran's reported in-service injury. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that a VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim of service connection could be proven").

Lastly, the record indicates that there may be outstanding relevant treatment records. As noted above, the Veteran reported seeing a doctor who suggested that surgery is the only way for the pain to go away. The record, however, does not contain any record of this, nor is there any indication that the VA attempted to obtain these records. Therefore, a remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the Veteran and his representative and ask the Veteran to identify any treatment records that have not been associated with his claims file. Following the receipt of any necessary authorizations associate these records with the claims file.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's left and/or right hallux rigidus is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) began in or are otherwise the result of military service.

If possible, the clinician should be a clinician other than the January 2024 VA examiner. The claims folder, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner and such review should be noted in the examination report.
