REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Army Reserves with a period of active duty from March 1991 to March 1996 and subsequent service in the Army National Guard. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In this regard, although the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket in his July 2024 VA Form VA Form 10182, he included evidence on the VA Form 10182 by way of his statements. As the Veteran submitted evidence with his notice of disagreement, it is unclear whether he intended to elect the Direct Review or Evidence Submission docket. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). However, the Board finds that there is no prejudice in proceeding with the appeal on the Direct Review docket as remand is needed to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. Thus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in conjunction with completing the remand development. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded.

The Veteran generally contends that his headaches are due to his military service. See Veteran's statement in support of claim, dated November 5, 2023. 

After a review of the record, the Board determines that a remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). "Active military, naval, or air service" includes active duty; any period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; or any period of inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) in which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident occurring during such training. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary in a claim for service connection when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-86 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).

The elements of § 3.159(c)(4)(i) are satisfied for this claim. Regarding the first element, the Veteran reports experiencing regular headaches and at least once per month being knocked out of commission to the point that he is totally incapacitated and unable to complete daily activities for three hours. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability"). The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reflect that in November 1992 the Veteran was treated for a right ear infection and complained of a slight headache. Additionally, in a November 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that during his service he had to get a root canal which added to the headaches. The Veteran's STRs reflect that in January 1996 he had a root canal to tooth #15. In February 1996, he had tooth #17 surgically removed because it was impacted. This evidence supports the Veteran's statements regarding having dental work completed during his active duty. Thus, the evidence establishes that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service. The evidence also indicates that the Veteran's headaches may be associated with his service and there is insufficient evidence of record for a decision to be made on the claim. Thus, a VA examination is necessary to adjudicate the Veteran's claim.   

Additionally, the Veteran's STRs reflect that he was treated for migraine headaches and that he had been having headaches for a year. He also indicated that he had experienced a heat casualty about a year ago. This STR appears to be dated in December 1999, but the final "9" is slightly illegible and could be interpreted to be a "6." The Veteran's STRs further reflect that he was treated for profound heat exhaustion in June 1994, during his period of active duty. It is unclear from the record whether the treatment received in December 1996/1999 occurred during a period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA and it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error that his dates of such service were not verified. Thus, on remand, the AOJ must verify the dates of the Veteran's ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA service.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, a remand is warranted to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors of not obtaining records concerning ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA service, and not obtaining a VA medical examination concerning the Veteran's headaches. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's complete service personnel records, to include all documents pertaining to service in the Army National Guard. Verify the dates of ACDUTRA and INADUCTRA, in particular for December 1996 and December 1999. If necessary, a request should be made to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). Document all requests for information as well as all responses in the claims file.

2. After completing the development above, provide the Veteran an appropriate VA examination (or telehealth interview, if an in-person examination is not feasible) for the Veteran's headaches claim. The electronic claims file must be made available to the examiner for review in connection with the examination.  All indicated tests should be conducted, and the reports of any such studies should be associated with the claims file. 

After reviewing the claims file, the examiner should address the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headaches are attributable to his military service, to include treatment during active duty, any injuries or diseases during a period of ACDUTRA, or an injury during a period of INACDUTRA?

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history and that such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. The examiner must fully explain the rationale for any opinion, with citation to supporting clinical data/lay statements, as deemed appropriate. If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, he or she should expressly indicate this and provide supporting rationale as to why an opinion cannot be made without resorting to speculation.
