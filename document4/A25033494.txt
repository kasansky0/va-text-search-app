CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for dental bleeding on probing and inflammation sores on tongue from braces by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for malocclusion by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 2009 to February 2017.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 Supplemental Claim rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which continued a noncompensable (0 percent) rating for dental bleeding and malocclusion. In September 2023, the Veteran filed for a Higher-Level Review decision, and later that month, the noncompensable ratings for dental bleeding and malocclusion were continued. In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, in which he elected the Direct review docket.

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted written correspondence stating, "I no longer wish to pursue my increased rating claims for (1) dental bleeding on probing and inflammation sores on tongue from braces and (2) malocclusion. Please update my file and dismiss this NOD without delay."

As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
