DOCKET NO. 250304-521082
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA was aggravated by his service-connected coronary artery bypass graft with atherosclerotic heart disease, myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease and heart valve replacement (heart disability).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA, as secondary to a service-connected heart disability, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1966 to May 1969.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2025 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2025 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that, when a veteran selects the Direct Review docket but submits additional evidence with the NOD, the NOD is rendered unclear under?38?C.F.R. §?20.202(f) and the Board is required to seek clarification from the veteran regarding his or her preferred docket. Edwards v. McDonough, 36?Vet. App.?56 (2023). Here, the record reflects that, in March 2025, alongside his NOD, the Veteran included a lay statement regarding his claim. In the March 2025 Docketing Letter to the Veteran and his representative, they were notified that his appeal was currently on the Direct Review docket, and as such, his additional evidence could not be considered by the Board. The Board also notes that, although the deadline allowing claimants to switch dockets under the modernized review system (AMA) pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not yet lapsed, the Board may proceed with adjudication of the matter on appeal because the service connection claim will be fully granted and there is no prejudice to the Veteran. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).

The record in this case is clear as to whether the Veteran has a current disability related to his claim. The September 2023 VA examination shows a diagnosis of OSA, as shown in a sleep study completed in 2014. Furthermore, the heart disability is subject to service connection. The AOJ made favorable findings to this effect in the February 2025 rating decision, and these are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the first and second elements of service connection are satisfied.

Regarding the nexus element of the claim, the Board remanded the claim in July 2024 to obtain a medical opinion. In January 2025, the AOJ obtained a medical opinion in favor of service connection. Specifically, the examiner found that the Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not aggravated beyond its natural progression by his heart disability. The examiner cited medical literature submitted by the Veteran in December 2023 indicating that heart failure is associated with reduced functional performance, depression, excessive daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The examiner further noted that most individuals diagnosed with chronic heart failure report poor sleep quality, and many have poor sleep continuity; insomnia symptoms are also common. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's heart disability causes altered sleep architecture, which aggravates his OSA. The Board finds that the opinion is probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

In sum, as the elements of service connection are satisfied, service connection for OSA is warranted.

In light of the fully favorable resolution of the claim, no further analysis on any other theory of entitlement is warranted.
