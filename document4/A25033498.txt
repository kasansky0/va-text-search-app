REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Eileen Patterson of Park Dental, a non-VA medical provider who rendered dental services to the Veteran on April 23, 2020.  

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2020 Explanation of Payment (EOP) decision of the VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Review docket. 

However, during the pendency of the appeal, the claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on April 23, 2020, was administratively approved.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the April 23, 2020, episode of care.  A July 2021explanation of payment reported payment was issued in the amount of $1,183.01 for the dental claim.  

In a July 2021 letter, the AOJ advised the appellant the appeal for medical services rendered on April 23, 2020, by provider Eileen Patterson was approved upon a secondary administrative review.  The letter explained that the claim related to the episode of care would be processed according to VA policy.

The July 2021 administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the April 23, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the December 2020 denial, and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Veteran disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
