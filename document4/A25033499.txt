ORDER

A rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus has been assigned a 10 percent disability rating, which is the maximum rating permitted under the regulations.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a rating higher than 10 percent for tinnitus are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.104, 3.160, 3.2500, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from December 1999 to September 2012.

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notes the Veteran requested review of his hemorrhoid claim and his tinnitus claim in his February 2024 Notice of Disagreement. However, as discussed below, the only claim before the Board is the Veteran's increased rating claim for tinnitus.

The decision on appeal to the Board from the regional office (referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)), was issued in February 2024 and is a non-initial increased rating claim. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Veteran first filed for service connection of his tinnitus in January 2012 by filing VA Form 21-0819 (VA/DOD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim). The Veteran also filed claims of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and external hemorrhoids at the same time on the same form. See January 2012 VA Form 21-0819. 

In October 2012, the AOJ granted the Veteran's tinnitus service-connection claim and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective September 29, 2012, the day after the Veteran separated from military service. See October 2012 Rating Decision. As the Veteran did not appeal the decision within one year, it became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; C.F.R. § 3.104.

In November 2012, the AOJ denied both the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and hemorrhoid claims. See November 2012 Notification Letter. As the Veteran did not appeal the decision within one year, it became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; C.F.R. § 3.104.

In February 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) for an increased rating of his service-connected tinnitus. The February 2024 claim constitutes a new non-initial claim for an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.160, 3.2500(c); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

In the February 2024 Claim, the Veteran also included a claim for bilateral hearing loss and external hemorrhoids. In February 2024, the AOJ sent the Veteran a letter noting the following: the Veteran had not met the procedural requirements for appealing his bilateral hearing loss and external hemorrhoid claims, the one-year time-period to appeal a rating decision had expired, and included information indicating the Veteran could file VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim) with new and relevant evidence to pursue his disability claims. See February 2024 AMA Review Letter. As the Veteran did not file an appeal within one year of the May 2012 and October 2012 rating decisions, they were final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; C.F.R. § 3.104. The Board notes the Veteran has not filed a Supplemental Claim form for either the bilateral hearing loss or the external hemorrhoid claims.

The AOJ denied the Veteran's increased rating for tinnitus claim in February 2024, and the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), noting the February 2024 Rating Decision, and requesting review of his external hemorrhoid claim and "ringing in ear," which is tinnitus. See February 2024 Notice of Disagreement. As noted above, the Veteran has not filed a Supplemental Claim for his external hemorrhoids and this issue was not addressed in the February 2024 AOJ decision; thus, the issue is not before the Board, and it will not be discussed further. 

In the February 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran selected direct review of his claim; thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision, which was identified as the decision being appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

As noted above, service connection for tinnitus was granted in the May 2012 Rating Decision and assigned an initial 10 percent rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260, effective September 29, 2012. And the Veteran seeks a higher rating.

According to VA regulations, a 10 percent evaluation is the maximum schedular rating allowed for tinnitus under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. Therefore, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus disability has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available. Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Thus, there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular evaluation. Moreover, neither the Veteran, nor his Representative, Nevada Department of Veteran Services, has alleged that extraschedular consideration is warranted. Accordingly, the claim for an initial higher rating is denied.
