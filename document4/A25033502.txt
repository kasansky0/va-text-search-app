ORDER

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the February 28, 2020, episode of care provided to the Veteran.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on February 28, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801 (2024)

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical care services to the Veteran.

In January 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) AOJ. 

The Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on February 28, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.? The claim was previously denied due to untimely filing. The claim was resurrected and processed for payment in July 2021. The payment was made in August 2021.

The July 2021 and August 2021 administrative actions for the entire February 28, 2020, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.? No determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.? 38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
