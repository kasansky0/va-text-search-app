DOCKET NO. 221117-296689
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss is related to in-service noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from September 1970 to April 1972. 

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with a VA decision on their claim to seek review.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2022 rating decision of VA.  In his November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, pursuant to AMA.

The Veteran appeared at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in April 2025.   A transcript of the hearing is in the Veteran's file.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement."  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran contends that he was exposed to noise while in service.  The Veteran's DD 214 shows that his military specialty occupation was radio teletype operator.  

At his April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran reported that he fired M-16 rifles and practiced with hand grenades at the firing range.  He stated that while working as a radio operator, he was exposed to excessive engine and generator noise.  He noted having difficulty understanding others when they talked, to include when background noise was present and having to turn up the volume of the television.  

A private medical note, dated in January 2021, shows that the Veteran reported exposure to loud noise from explosives and gun fire during service.  He noted that he was not provided hearing protection.  The Veteran denied post service loud noise exposure.  A diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was provided.  The private doctor opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss was related to noise exposure while serving in the military.  The private doctor stated that often the degree of noise related injury may not manifest fully immediately following an injury.  In such cases, the full extent of the hearing loss may not be noticed for years following the noise induced injury.   

The Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination in January 2022.  A diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was provided.  The VA examiner opined that it was not as likely as not that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was caused by or a result of an event in military service.  The VA examiner noted that after a review of the differences between the entrance and separation audiograms, there was no clinically significant change in hearing.  In an April 2022 VA medical addendum, the VA examiner stated that the Veteran's separation examination showed hearing to be well within normal limits with no reasonable room for a clinically significant threshold shift to have occurred in either ear during the period of active duty.  It was, therefore, less likely as not that military noise contributed to the Veteran's currently exhibited bilateral hearing loss.  In a September 2022 VA medical addendum, the same VA examiner stated that while noise exposure may be conceded because of an MOS, a duty assignment, a verified noise hazard, or lay statements, associated damage to the auditory system was not necessarily a concession and hearing loss was not necessarily to be expected.  Based upon the existing data, the probability remained that it was less likely than not that military noise contributed to the current hearing loss.

A review of the record shows that the Veteran has a hearing impairment for VA purposes in both ears pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  See January 2022 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination report.  Next, while there are both positive and negative medical opinions of record, in this case, the Board affords the VA examiner's medical opinions less probative value as the VA examiner relied on there being no permanent threshold shift in service, which is not a requirement for service connection.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that such an opinion is inadequate as the lack of in-service hearing loss, or a threshold shift, is not fatal to a service connection claim for hearing loss.  See generally Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Conversely, the more probative medical evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's hearing loss is related to his in-service noise exposure.  The January 2021 private doctor indicated that the Veteran was exposed to loud noise while in service and that it was at least as likely as not that his hearing loss was a direct result of that exposure.  In addition, the Board finds the Veteran's April 2025 hearing testimony both competent and credible.  Therefore, the Board also assigns more probative weight to the Veteran's hearing testimony. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record establishes a nexus between service and the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss. Thus, service connection is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
