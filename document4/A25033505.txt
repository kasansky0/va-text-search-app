ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria from May 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

From May 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent, or totally disabling.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria from May 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350(i)(2), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from November 1990 to July 1994.  

This matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the portion of the rating decision pertaining to the issue above and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC based on housebound criteria, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

1. Effective Date for SMC Based on Housebound Criteria 

The Veteran contends an entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 1, 2018, for the grant of SMC based on housebound criteria.  See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

Special monthly compensation can be paid pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) if a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  A veteran will be considered to be permanently housebound when he or she is substantially confined to his or her dwelling (ward or clinical areas if institutionalized) and the immediate premises by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities reasonably certain to remain throughout his or her lifetime.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(2).  

While the total disability requirement must be met by a single disability, the 60 percent requirement may be met by applying the combined rating of the Veteran's remaining disabilities.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (noting that combined ratings satisfy the second requirement but not the first).  

In this case, a September 2019 rating decision had awarded entitlement to a TDIU effective April 20, 2019, the date of receipt of claim for unemployability.  

Thereafter, a December 2019 rating decision awarded an earlier effective date of July 31, 2018, for entitlement to a TDIU.  The RO noted that the effective date was based on the claim being received within one year of schedular requirements being met for entitlement to a TDIU.  The RO further noted that the entitlement to a TDIU from July 31, 2018, was based solely on the Veteran's service-connected bipolar disorder.  

A December 2020 rating decision awarded entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria effective December 14, 2017, to April 30, 2018, and from July 31, 2018.  The Veteran met the criteria for SMC housebound from December 14, 2017, to April 30, 2018, based on the 100 percent rating for residuals of left knee replacement and additional service-connected right knee replacement, independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  The Veteran met the criteria for SMC housebound from July 31, 2018, on account of bipolar disorder rated 100 percent as a sole disability for the grant of a TDIU, and additional service-connected disability of residuals right knee total replacement, independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal found that entitlement to a TDIU was warranted effective May 1, 2018.  The RO noted that entitlement to TDIU from May 1, 2018, to July 31, 2018, was due to the Veteran's service-connected status post fracture radial head and status post-surgical repair of the left elbow (impairment of supination and pronation), residuals inversion injury right ankle status post ankle surgery, residuals of left total knee replacement, status post fracture radial head and status post-surgical repair of the left elbow (limitation of flexion), and residuals of right total knee replacement.  The RO further noted that since July 31, 2018, entitlement to a TDIU was due solely on single disability of bipolar disorder.  Regarding SMC based on housebound criteria, the RO reiterated that the criteria was met effective July 31, 2018, because the criteria regarding housebound was met based on a single disability of bipolar disorder and additional service-connected disabilities that met or exceeded 60 percent.  

After this appeal was filed, a subsequent November 2024 rating decision granted an earlier effective date of June 19, 2018, for the 100 percent rating for bipolar disorder.  As such, the RO awarded an earlier effective date of June 19, 2018, for entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria.  

The Veteran seeks an effective date of May 1, 2018, for SMC based on housebound criteria.  See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  He states that entitlement to a TDIU was granted effective May 1, 2018, based on his service-connected bilateral knees, left elbow, and right ankle.  Id.  He asserts that the bilateral knees and left elbow impairments were granted as secondary to the right ankle impairment.  Id.  He further states that entitlement to a TDIU was based on disabilities with the same etiology, which constitutes a single disability, and the Veteran meets the criteria for SMC based on housebound criteria pursuant to Bradley and CFR § 4.16.  Id.  Alternatively, he argues that entitlement to a TDIU based on the disabilities affecting a single body system, orthopedic in this case, fulfills the requirement under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  Id.  He further argues that starting prior to May 1, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric impairment was rated at 50 percent and his service-connected painful elbow scar is rated at 10 percent, both of which combine to meet the 60 percent additional disability requirement.  Id.  

A TDIU may be granted for the purpose of serving as a single 100 percent disability for SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  However, a TDIU must be warranted based solely on a single disability.  Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280; Buie, 24 Vet. App. 242.  However, as the Veteran's TDIU from May 1, 2018, to July 31, 2018, was based on a combination of multiple service-connected disabilities the single service-connected disability requirement is not met.  The Veteran met entitlement to SMC based on housebound status from June 19, 2018, due to the 100 percent rating for bipolar disorder assigned on that date.  The Board acknowledge the Veteran's argument that he meets the SMC housebound criteria based on disabilities with the same etiology or affecting a single body system.  However, for the purposes of SMC based on housebound criteria, a TDIU can only be based on a single disability without consideration of the provisions in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) that provides for the combining of disabilities to arrive at the schedular criteria.  In Bradley, the Court noted that combining disabilities under 4.16(a) to result in a TDIU is limited to basic TDIU only and does not quality as "single disability" for purposes of SMC based on housebound criteria.  Additionally, in Youngblood v. Wilkie, it was noted that although multiple disabilities stemming from the same etiology or affecting the same body part may be considered a single disability for purposes of meeting the threshold requirements of schedular TDIU consideration, this combination of disabilities for meeting schedular requirements of TDIU does not apply to the rating requirement for SMC at the housebound rate.  Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412, 415 (2019), aff'd sub nom. Youngblood v. McDonough, 838 F. App'x 566 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The Board notes that combined ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) may satisfy the second requirement of additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, but not the first requirement of a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent for SMC based on housebound criteria.

Further, with respect to the argument about the period prior to May 1, 2018, the Board notes that the Veteran is already awarded entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria from December 14, 2017, to April 30, 2018.  For the period prior to December 14, 2017, the record does not show that the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability.  

Thus, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 1, 2018, to June 19, 2018, for SMC based on housebound criteria is not met, and the claim is denied.
