DOCKET NO. 250122-502211
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Due to the death of the appellant (Veteran), the appeal of entitlement to service connection for low back and upper back disabilities is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On January 25, 2025, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from June 1955 to July 1956. He died in January 2025.

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 26, 2024, rating decision. On September 27, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 26, 2024 decision.  In his January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), submitted prior to his death, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
