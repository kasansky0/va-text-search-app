REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active duty military service from September 1969 to April 1972, including service in the Republic of Vietnam, during which he earned the Combat Infantry Badge. 

This matter comes before the Board on appeal of a rating decision issued in July 2020, which granted entitlement to TDIU effective February 13, 2013, and entitlement to DEA benefits on the same date. In the October 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

This matter was previously before the Board on several occasions, followed by appeals to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and the Court has subsequently returned the matter to the Board. Most recently, in March 2024, the Board denied entitlement to an effective date prior to February 2013 for the award of TDIU and DEA benefits. The Veteran appealed the matter to the Court and a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) was issued which returned the matter to the Board for additional action. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2013, for the grant of a TDIU on an extraschedular basis

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2013, for the grant of DEA benefits per 38 U.S.C.  Chapter 35

In a Board decision issued in July 2020, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU was granted. (See BVA Decision, 07/07/2020.) Jurisdiction over the matter then reverted to the AOJ for assignment of the effective date. The AOJ issued a rating decision in July 2020 which assigned a February 13, 2013, effective date for the grant of TDIU and DEA benefits. (See Rating Decision, 07/14/2020.) The date of February 13, 2013, was assigned because that was the date on which the schedular rating requirements of at least a 70 percent disability rating for multiple disabilities was met. The Board notes that the matter of an appropriate effective date for DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with that of the effective date for TDIU benefits.

The Veteran asserts that the proper effective date for this matter is April 29, 2010, the date of the claim for increased disability benefits which underlies this current appeal. (See Third Party Correspondence, 03/12/2025.) Specifically, the Veteran asserts that his posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined with his diabetes, hearing loss, and tinnitus, rendered him unemployable on the date of claim. He asserts that consideration must be given to his education, work history, and training in determining whether the service-connected disabilities are sufficiently severe to preclude gainful employment. The Veteran is shown to have a high school education and a work history which primarily involved driving a truck. A vocational rehabilitation counselor opinion has been provided by the Veteran asserting that the Veteran has been unemployable due to service-connected disabilities since at least April 29, 2010. (See Third Party Correspondence, 11/27/2017.)

Based on the findings of the JMR and the arguments put forth by the Veteran, the Board finds that a referral to the Director of Compensation Services (Director) is warranted. Indeed, the evidence indicative of the need for such a referral existed at the time of the rating decision issued in July 2020. Therefore, failure to obtain the opinion constitutes pre-decisional error under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The AOJ is to refer the matter to the Director for an opinion on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the Veteran's claim for TDIU to VA's Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.
