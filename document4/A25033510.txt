Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the Army from November 2002 to November 2011.

The appeal originates from December 2022 and April 2023 decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO/AOJ). The Veteran appealed those decisions by filing a VA Form 10182,  Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in June 2023. He elected Direct Review by Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, consideration can only be given to the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.303. The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the VA Form 10182 was received, or (2) evidence submitted after the VA Form 10182. Id.

Evidence was submitted during a period when new evidence was not allowed, including with the June 2023 VA Form 10182. See, e.g., June 2023 VA 21-8940. In January 2025 correspondence, the Board advised the Veteran that this evidence could not be considered under the Direct Review option and that he could request to change dockets. The Veteran did not respond to that inquiry.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ on readjudication. 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for degenerative disc disease of the thoracic spine.

The Board notes that a December 2011 VA treatment record indicates the Veteran's receipt of income from "Social Security, other: med[ical] retirement." This suggests that he has been receiving Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits for unemployability based on disability. These records appear relevant to the appeal. However, the AOJ failed to request them prior to the decisions on appeal. See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board is aware that records from the SSA were obtained subsequent to the decisions on appeal. Regardless, it was a pre-decisional error in not timely obtaining the SSA records, and remand is necessary to afford the AOJ an opportunity to consider them in the first instance. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD and panic disorder with alcohol use disorder (in remission).

3. Entitlement to a TDIU.

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in April 2023. In describing relevant mental health history and treatment, the examiner indicated that the Veteran was seen by his VA provider in February and March 2023, but that these treatment records were not contained in the file. Notably, these records were associated with the file one week after the examination and show that the Veteran was prescribed additional psychiatric medications due to an increase in anxiety and panic attacks. 

The April 2023 examination makes no reference to these updated prescriptions, suggesting that the examiner did not have a complete understanding of the Veteran's treatment history. Yet the AOJ did not request an addendum despite the examiner's notation that there were treatment records outstanding. Such constitutes a pre-decisional error requiring remand.  

With respect to a TDIU, the Veteran contended that he was unable to work secondary to difficulty relating to people and maintaining competitive expectations. See April 2023 VA Examination. This raised an implied claim for a TDIU based on his service-connected psychiatric disability. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). The TDIU claim is inextricably intertwined with the increased rating claim for the psychiatric disability (with the latter including consideration of total occupational impairment as part of the schedular rating criteria), and the former cannot be adjudicated at this time. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request an addendum from the April 2023 PTSD examiner. After reviewing the February and March 2023 VA treatment records (associated with the file on April 20, 2023) showing prescription of new psychiatric medications, the examiner is asked to opine on the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with respect to his psychiatric disability (i.e., whether the evidence remains consistent with reduced reliability and productivity or greater impairment). The examiner should also note any additional symptomology or functional impact raised by the treatment records. 

2. Review the SSA records and readjudicate all the issues on appeal.
