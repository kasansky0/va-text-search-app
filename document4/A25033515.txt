ORDER

An initial evaluation of 10 percent, but not in excess thereof, for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his hypertension is productive of a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more controlled by medication but is not productive of diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial evaluation of 10 percent, but not in excess thereof, for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1995 to March 2000.

In September 2023, the Regional Office (RO) denied service connection for hypertension. In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issue of service connection for hypertension most recently addressed in a September 2023 rating decision.  In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which granted service connection for hypertension with an evaluation of 0 percent, effective February 14, 2023. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Veteran listed the September 2023 rating decision as the decision on appeal and noted "service connection for hypertension is denied." He also noted his disagreement with "disability evaluation, my current medication is the reason my condition has lower readings." The July 2024 rating decision granted service connection and assigned a disability rating. Thus, the issue on appeal is entitlement to an initial compensable disability evaluation for hypertension.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that, at the time of the assignment of an initial rating for a disability following an initial award of service connection for that disability, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as staged ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a claim, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. In Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) explained that positive and negative evidence does not have to be in exact equipoise before the benefit of the doubt should be given to the claimant. Rather, a claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance, that is, "nearly equal." The Federal Circuit explained that evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal when the evidence "persuasively favors one side or the other."

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension.

The Veteran seeks a compensable disability rating for his hypertension. 

The Veteran's hypertension is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Under this code, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or for a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more controlled by medication. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. A maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

Hypertension is defined as diastolic blood pressure that is predominantly 90 mm or greater. Isolated systolic hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure that is predominantly 160 mm or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. Systolic blood pressure is the top number, and diastolic is the bottom number.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the Rating Schedule. The Board observes in passing that "predominant" is defined as "being most frequent or common." See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 978 (11th ed. 2012).

Similarly, VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) defines predominant in DC 7101 to mean "most common or prevailing." V.iii.5.3.e. Although the Board is not bound by the M-21-1, it is "required to discuss any relevant provisions as part of the duty to provide adequate reasons or bases if the Board chooses to rely on an M21-1 provision as a factor to support its decision." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). In this case, the Board finds the M21-1's guidance helpful insofar as it is consistent with the dictionary definitions discussed above.

In Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), the Court held that, in the context of assigning disability ratings, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. However, Diagnostic Code 7101 explicitly contemplates the effects of medication; any ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication are not discounted in the evaluation. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016). In a recent precedential decision, the Court held that under Diagnostic Code 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a Veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

Turning to the evidence, throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has had a diagnosis of hypertension requiring continuous medication for control.

VA treatment records show that in December 1997, the Veteran's blood pressure was 160/78. In June 2000, he stated that he had been checking his blood pressure at his girlfriend's workplace and had been getting readings of 160/140 and 140/80. In January 2021, his blood pressure was 130/80 and in June 2022 it was 140/769.

The Veteran's private medical records show that in May 2019, his blood pressure was controlled with medication. 

The Veteran received a VA examination in May 2023. The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 2016. He reported that his blood pressure (BP) has steadily increased and required more medication with time. The examiner noted that the Veteran has a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. Continuous medications for his hypertension were documented. The Veteran's blood pressure was measured to be 152/90, 144/90 and 146/86, taken the same day in May 2023. Separate blood pressure readings show that on May 12, 2023, the Veteran's readings were 159/109 and 143/106. On May 15, 2023, his reading was 152/100. The examiner remarked that the Veteran uses daily prescription medication to reduce his BP, with documented diagnosis of hypertension. The examiner added that the Veteran's BP was affected by his medication the day of the examination and that it was reasonable to believe that his HTN would be more severe if measured without medication use. See C&P Exam [received 5/18/2023].

The Veteran submitted to another VA examination in April 2024. The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension in 2000. He denied current symptoms. The examiner noted that the Veteran does not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. Continuous medications for his hypertension were documented. The Veteran's blood pressure was measured to be 162/106, 149/99 and 148/102, taken the day of the examination. See C&P Exam [received 4/19/2024].

The May 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran has a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. The VA examiner noted several readings where the diastolic pressure was 100 or more. While the April 2024 VA examiner found the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more, they failed to acknowledge the previous readings of 100 or more shown on record. Therefore, the Board gives more probative value to the May 2023 VA examination.

The Board finds that an evaluation of 10 percent is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension. A 10 percent rating is warranted for a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more controlled by medication. The Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran has a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more. See Wilson, 35 Vet. App. at 75. All doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor. Accordingly, an initial 10 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension.

At no point during the relevant appeal period do the records show that the Veteran's hypertension was characterized by diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Thus, a higher 20 percent evaluation for hypertension under Diagnostic Code 7101 is not warranted.

In sum, the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran has diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more. An initial 10 percent rating, and no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's hypertension. 38 U.S.C. § 5107b; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
