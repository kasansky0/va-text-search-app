DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a prostate disability, to include benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's kidney disorder was not caused by or related to active-duty service, to include exposure to toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a prostate disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1983 to August 2003.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.

Certain diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in service when manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from active duty. 38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. As there is no evidence or claim that the Veteran was diagnosed with the claimed disabilities within one year of service the above provision is not applicable.

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the alternative, service connection is also warranted for disability proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Id.; see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for benign prostatic hypertrophy 

The Veteran contends that his prostate disability was incurred in service or otherwise caused by service. Specifically, he asserts that his BPH was caused by his in-service TERA. 

As an initial matter, the Veteran's BPH is not a disorder that applies for presumption. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. However, notwithstanding the presumption, service connection for a disability claimed as due to exposure to Agent Orange may be established by showing that a disorder resulting in disability was in fact causally linked to such exposure. See Brock v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 155, 162-64 (1997); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1044 (Fed. Cir. 1994), citing 38 U.S.C. § 1113 (b) and 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for the Veteran's prostate disability. First, the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect complaints of, continuous treatment for or a diagnosis of a prostate disability during active-duty service. In fact, the Veteran's July 2003 separation examination and report of medical history were negative for these conditions or symptoms related thereto.

Moreover, the post-service evidence does not reflect symptoms of this disorder until many years after separation. He did not have any signs or symptoms in the clinical evidence until approximately 2022. Indeed, the Veteran himself has not asserted that he has experienced prostate issues since service.  Therefore, continuous symptoms have not been shown.

Next, the evidence also does not indicate that the Veteran's prostate disability is otherwise related to active-duty service.  Specifically, the Board relies on the medical opinion provided in July 2023 where the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate disorder was less likely than not related to any in service TERA. He provided the rationale that BPH is a common finding among men over the age of 50, noting there is not enough evidence in current medical literature that demonstrates a causal relationship between the exposure events the Veteran experienced and the BPH. Additionally, the Board notes the negative opinion is the only medical opinion of record. 

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board has also considered the statements made by the Veteran, relating his prostate disorder to his active service. The Federal Circuit has held that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).

In this case, however, the Veteran is not competent to provide testimony regarding a diagnosis and/or etiology of his prostate disability. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377, n.4. Because these conditions are not diagnosed by unique and readily identifiable features, they do not involve a simple identification that a layperson is competent to make. Therefore, the unsubstantiated statements regarding the claimed diagnosis and etiology of the Veteran's disorder are found to lack competency.

In light of the above discussion, the Board concludes that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for a kidney disorder and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). Therefore, the appeal is denied. The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
