ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for entitlement to a total rating for compensation based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (DEA) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has continuously pursued a claim for TDIU as part of an increased rating claim initiated on March 14, 2021.  As of March 14, 2021, the evidence shows that the service-connected disabilities precluded the Veteran securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.

2. The effective date for TDIU, which created entitlement to DEA, is March 14, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for the grant of individual unemployability (TDIU) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 2.5000, 3.400(o), 4.16.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?3501, 3512;?38?C.F.R. §§?21.3021, 21.3040, 21.3041

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2002 to February 2009, from October 2009 to July 2010, and from July 2010 to March 2011. 

This case comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office (RO), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The September 2023 rating?decision denied entitlement to earlier effective dates for TDIU and DEA.  In February 2024, the Veteran requested a direct review of the appeal by the Board.? ?? 

The current appeal stems from the Veteran's selection of direct review, in which the Veteran acknowledged that the review will be based on the evidence submitted to VA at the time of the AOJ decisions on the issues on appeal.  Therefore, only evidence of record as of the date of the September 2023 rating?decision will be considered.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but no earlier, for TDIU.

The Veteran raised a TDIU claim as part of an increased rating claim for service-connected psychiatric and migraine headache disabilities.  The July 2022 rating decision which continued ratings for the psychiatric and headache disabilities, also established entitlement to TDIU, effective March 16, 2022.  The AOJ explained that the effective date assigned was the date VA received the Veteran's supplemental claim filing.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for TDIU.  The Veteran's attorney has argued that the proper effective date for TDIU should be March 14, 2021. The Board agrees.

A TDIU claim is a form of increased rating.  A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim.  Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).  Therefore, a grant of a TDIU is an award of increased disability compensation for purposes of assigning an effective date.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 367 (1991).

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability rated 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more service-connected disabilities, provided at least one disability is rated 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Consideration is given to such factors as the extent of the service-connected disability, and employment and educational background, and it must be shown that the service-connected disability produces unemployability without regard to intercurrent disability or advancing age.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19. Substantially gainful employment is defined as work that is more than marginal and that permits the individual to earn a living wage.  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991).

As the Veteran has at least one disability rated 40 percent or more, and there are sufficient additional service-connected disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for consideration of the assignment of TDIU, effective December 13, 2017.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Therefore, consideration of entitlement to TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) is warranted.

In this case, on March 14, 2021, VA ordered a review examination of service- connected psychiatric and migraine headache disabilities. 

A March 20, 2021, rating decision, increased the rating for migraine headaches to 50 percent, and continued a 70 percent rating for PTSD.

On March 16, 2022, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application regarding increased ratings for the migraine headache and psychiatric disabilities.  On that date, the Veteran also submitted a VA Form 21-8940 application for TDIU and explicitly stated that the request for TDIU was not a new claim for benefits but rather part of the increased rating claims on appeal.

A July 2022 rating decision established entitlement to TDIU, effective March 16, 2022.

Based on a review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued a claim for a TDIU since March 14, 2021, when VA ordered a review examination of the service-connected psychiatric and migraine headache disabilities.  That examination showed that the Veteran was not working or pursuing education.

The Board further finds that an effective date earlier than March 14, 2021, for the award of TDIU is not warranted, as a claim for TDIU was not reasonably raised prior to March 14, 2021.

The Board notes that the evidence of record shows that the Veteran was last employed in May 2019 as a home health clinician and occupational therapy assistant.

During an appropriate evidentiary window, the Veteran provided a private April 2023 medical opinion.  In that letter, a physician opined that, after reviewing the claims file and consulting with the Veteran, in a thorough and detailed report, the Veteran had been unable to maintain substantial gainful employment as result of service-connected disabilities since, at least, March 14, 2021, the date of the claim. The examiner stated that the Veteran would be unable to work substantially gainful employment in both physical and sedentary work as the service-connected disabilities interfered with the ability to focus, stay motivated, concentrate, and would require frequent breaks and absences. 

The Board has reviewed the private April 2023 medical opinion and finds the opinion to be competent, credible, and persuasive.  The private examiner concluded that the service-connected disabilities effectively precluded the Veteran from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation since March 2021.  The Board finds the April 2023 opinion to be highly probative because it is supported by a detailed rationale and provided by a trained professional, in this case a physician.  Accordingly, the April 2023 private opinion is found to carry significant weight.  Among the factors for assessing the probative value of an opinion are the examiner's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993) (it is the responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given the evidence); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1992).  The probative value of medical evidence is based on the examiner's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the conclusion he reaches.  As is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).

The Board acknowledges that there may be contradictory evidence of record. However, because of the detail and thoroughness of the private April 2023 private examination report, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximated regarding whether the collective impact of the service-connected disabilities precluded the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment since March 14, 2021, the date the TDIU became pending before VA.  The evidence does not show, and the Veteran has not claimed, that it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability causing unemployability occurred during the year prior to March 14, 2021.

Accordingly, based on the foregoing, and resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service-connected disability prevented the Veteran from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and occupational experience since March 14, 2021, the date of TDIU claim filing.  Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is warranted as of March 14, 2021, but not earlier.  Thus, entitlement to a TDIU is granted as of March 14, 2021, but not earlier.  With regard to any earlier effective date, the Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran regarding entitlement to any earlier effective date.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for eligibility for DEA.

A September 2023 rating?decision denied entitlement to an earlier effective date than March 16, 2022, for TDIU and basic eligibility for DEA.  The Veteran appealed the March 16, 2022, effective date for both the?TDIU?and eligibility to DEA.  This decision has granted an earlier effective date of March 14, 2021, but not earlier, for TDIU. 

Under the provisions governing eligibility of children for educational assistance, eligibility is based on the date that VA first finds that the parent from whom eligibility is derived has a service-connected total disability that is permanent in nature.  The term first finds is defined in the statute as the effective date of the rating or date of notification to the Veteran from whom eligibility is derived establishing a service-connected total disability that is permanent in nature, whichever is more advantageous to the eligible person.? 38?U.S.C. §?3512(a)(d); 38 C.F.R. §?21.3041(d)(1). 

The grant of DEA is based on the date permanent and total disability status was attained, which in this case is the date?TDIU?was granted.  As the effective date of?TDIU?is now March 14, 2021, the Board finds that an effective date of March 14, 2021, is also warranted for DEA benefits. Prior to March 14, 2021, the Veteran's service-connected disability rating was less than total.  Therefore, basic eligibility for DEA cannot be effective prior to March 14, 2021, and the claim for any earlier effective date than March 14, 2021, must be denied.
