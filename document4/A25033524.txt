REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from Air Force from August 1958 to August 1962. The Veteran filed a June 4, 2024 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022 and selecting the Direct Review docket. 

Timeliness of the June 4, 2024 Board Appeal request with respect to the rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022.

On June 4, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on March 18, 2022 that granted service connection for residuals of right hernia surgery and right inguinal hernia repair scar, both rated zero percent effective December 14, 2020, and denied service connection for hypertension, congestive heart failure, chest pain, degenerative arthritis with IVDS, and a groin condition and denied a 10 percent rating based upon multiple, non-compensable service-connected disabilities and the rating decision issue in April 25, 2022 that denied service connection for COPD with shortness of breath. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because his representative did not advise him about filing an appeal and did not set up transportation to the necessary appointments. See June 2024 VA Form 10182. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022, rating decisions. 

As noted above, the rating decision issued on March 18, 2022 granted service connection for residuals of right hernia surgery and right inguinal hernia repair scar, both rated zero percent effective December 14, 2020, and denied service connection for hypertension, congestive heart failure, chest pain, degenerative arthritis with IVDS, and a groin condition and denied a 10 percent rating based upon multiple, non-compensable service-connected disabilities. The Veteran was notified of the decision in letters dated March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022 that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letters were sent to the Veteran's address of record and were not returned as undeliverable. 

 The Veteran's June 4, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022.  

The Veteran asserts that good cause for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request exists because his representative did not advise him about filing an appeal or take him to necessary appointments. While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's complaints about his representative, the Board finds the Veteran's argument unpersuasive. As stated above, the Veteran received notice of his appellate rights with both rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022, and April 25, 2022. The record does not appear to show, and the Veteran has not asserted, that notification of these rating decisions was not received. Therefore, the Veteran received proper notice of his appellate rights, including instructions for filing an appeal within one year of the rating decisions. In this case, the Veteran's assertions regarding his representative do not provide good cause for why his Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to either rating decision, or why it could not have been filed sooner than it was. 

Accordingly, the June 4, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decisions issued on March 18, 2022 and April 25, 2022 rating decisions, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
