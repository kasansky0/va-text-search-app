ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) as of August 10, 2022, is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but not earlier, for service connection of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is granted.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) prior to August 10, 2022, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) as of August 10, 2022, is moot.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Appellant, the Veteran had superior vena cava syndrome prior to August 10, 2022, and medical evidence of record at that time showed that the disability was secondary to lung cancer.  The effective date of service connection of lung cancer, the primary disability, was August 10, 2022, so an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for superior vena cava syndrome as secondary to lung cancer is not possible.  Additionally, the weight of the evidence shows that a November 8, 2021, intent to file (ITF) attached to and was consumed by an April 18, 2022, claim for increase and TDIU rather than a claim for service connection for superior vena cava syndrome.

3. The weight of the evidence supports a finding that prior to August 10, 2022, the Veteran was not unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) have been met as of August 10, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but not earlier, for service connection of superior vena cava syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 4.3, 4.15, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1982 to November 2003.  The Veteran died in January 2023 and the Appellant seeks surviving spouse benefits.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions issued by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

1. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) as of August 10, 2022.

As of March 13, 2020, the Veteran had a 100 percent combined disability rating and was eligible for special monthly compensation for housebound status based on the presence of a single disability rated as totally disabling at 100 percent and other service-connected disabilities totalling 60 percent or more.  Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is moot as of August 10, 2022, as the Appellant does not stand to benefit from a grant of TDIU even on the basis of any single disability.

As the issue of entitlement to TDIU as of August 10, 2022, is moot, the Board finds that there is no genuine dispute as to fact or law for that period.  38 C.F.R. § 20.200.  

As the benefit sought is moot as of August 10, 2022, there is no remaining disagreement with any determination of fact or law as to that claim.  Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no longer any remaining case or controversy regarding entitlement to TDIU as of August 10, 2022, and the appeal must be dismissed for that period.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105(d)(5).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 4, 2022, for service connection for superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS).

On November 8, 2021, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC (ITF).  A March 2022 AOJ rating decision established service connection for several rheumatoid arthritis disabilities.  On April 18, 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability seeking an increased rating on the basis of unemployability resulting from several service-connected disabilities, including rheumatoid arthritis.  A September 2022 rating decision denied entitlement to TDIU.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim seeking review of a February 2022 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  The Board notes that this procedural history does not implicate the issue of service connection for superior vena cava syndrome, but is nonetheless necessary to understanding analysis of the claim for an earlier effective date.

On November 4, 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking to establish service connection for lung cancer and superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS).  A February 1, 2023, rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for SVCS.  On February 8, 2023, the Appellant filed VA Form 21P-534, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Survivors Pension and Accrued Benefits by a Surviving Spouse or Child, seeking surviving spouse benefits after the Veteran's death.  A March 2023 rating decision established service connection for lung cancer effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act.  A May 2023 rating decision established service connection for SVCS as secondary to the service-connected lung cancer disability, effective November 4, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection.

In August 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 rating decision.

In February 2024, the Appellant filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing the January 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Appellant contends that an earlier effective date for service connection for SVCS is warranted.  Specifically, the Appellant contends that the April 18, 2022, VA Form 8940 was part of a claim for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis, and consequently did not constitute a claim that could consume the November 8, 2021, ITF.  As a result, the Appellant contends, the ITF would have remained active and attached to the November 4, 2022, claim for service connection for lung cancer and SVCS.

The general rule regarding the assignment of effective date for an award based on an original claim for VA benefits is that the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  An exception to the general rule applies if an application for benefits is received within one year from the date of separation from active service, and an award is made on the basis of that application.  In that limited situation, the effective date of the award is the day following the date of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date will be the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Another exception to the general rule regarding assignment of effective date may apply when there is a change in law.  If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within one year from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a claimant received within one year from that date, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

A claimant, a duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of claimant who is not of full age or capacity may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  On receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The Board notes that service connection for SVCS was established as secondary to lung cancer and service connection for lung cancer was established effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act.  Service connection for a secondary disability cannot be effective before service connection for the primary disability.

However, the Board finds that the evidence of record prior to August 10, 2022, is at least in equipoise regarding whether or not SVCS was secondary to or caused by the service-connected lung cancer.  August 2021 private medical records note the presence of a large mass in the right upper lobe of the lung, compressing the superior vena cava.  An April 2023 VA medical opinion noted that was essentially a conclusion of secondary causation.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and Appellant, and without exercising impermissible medical judgment, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence shows that the SVCS was present prior to August 2021 and was due to or caused by the lung cancer disability, and that evidence was of record prior to August 10, 2022.  The Appellant's application for surviving spouse benefits was received within a year of the PACT Act becoming effective.  As a result, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, is warranted for service connection of SVCS.  The Board finds that an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for service connection of SVCS is not warranted.

TDIU is not always a separate claim, but can be a rating option available whenever a claimant seeks service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  TDIU can be raised at various stages of the claims process and arises when VA rates a disability.  Because TDIU can arise any time VA is rating a disability, VA may need to address TDIU as part of separate claim streams when rating different disabilities.  TDIU, when part of a claim for increase, is not a separate claim for benefits that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service connection or increased rating claim.  Rather, TDIU is part of that underlying claim, as an option for a potential rating, and the eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394 (2024).

The Appellant's contention hinges on an interpretation in which the April 2022 VA Form 21-8940 claim for increase and TDIU is not interpreted as a claim or application for benefits that would associate with and consume the November 8, 2021, ITF, leaving the ITF available to associate with the November 4, 2022, claim for service connection for SVCS.

The Board has considered the contention that the April 2022 VA Form 8940 claim for increase and TDIU was part of another claim, notably the claim for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  However, that claim was resolved in March 2022, when the AOJ issued a rating decision establishing service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  Therefore, the VA Form 8940 was not submitted during the pendency of the issue of service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  The Board also notes that no claim for increased rating for rheumatoid arthritis was pending at that time.  Consequently, the claim for increased rating and TDIU cannot be interpreted to be part of the claim for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.

The Board notes that recently the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that a claim for TDIU submitted on a VA Form 21-8940 can be a supplemental claim in some circumstances.  Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (Vet. App. Mar. 13, 2025).  However, even if characterized as a supplemental claim, ITFs still apply to supplemental claims.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  As a result, classification of the VA Form 21-8940 as a supplemental claim rather than a new claim does not have any impact on this issue.  The ITF would associate with and be consumed by the TDIU claim regardless.

The Board has also considered whether it is possible to interpret the VA Form 8940 as purely an evidence submission rather than any claims form.  However, the title of the form makes it clear that the form is used to claim entitlement to benefits.  The Board notes that the language of the regulation governing ITFs also precludes such an interpretation.  The relevant regulation states that if VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  The VA Form 8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, is unambiguously and expressly an application form as contemplated by the ITF regulation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  The Board notes that forms for submission of evidence exist and could have been used instead of a form specifically prescribed as an application for increased benefits.

Finally, the effective date for SVCS cannot be earlier than August 10, 2022, because that is the effective date of service connection of the primary disability.  The effective date for the lung cancer disability is not now before the Board, and therefore an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for SVCS is not possible on that basis.  Additionally, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence shows that the November 8, 2021, ITF associated with and was consumed by the April 2022 claim for increased compensation to include TDIU submitted on VA Form 21-8940.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection.  The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Appellant.  Therefore, the appeal must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) prior to August 10, 2022.

On November 8, 2021, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC (ITF).  A March 2022 AOJ rating decision established service connection for several rheumatoid arthritis disabilities.  On April 18, 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, seeking an increased rating on the basis of unemployability resulting from several service-connected disabilities, including rheumatoid arthritis.  A September 2022 rating decision denied entitlement to TDIU.  In November 2022, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim appealing the September 2022 rating decision.  In February 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision again denying entitlement to TDIU.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued a second rating decision based upon the Appellant's VA Form 21-534, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, Survivors Pension and Accrued Benefits by a Surviving Spouse or Child, finding that entitlement to TDIU was moot.

In May 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2023 rating decision.  In September 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 rating decision.

In February 2024, the Appellant filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing the September 2023 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.   38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran wants VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, and submit or identify that evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

It is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to make it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38?C.F.R. §§?3.340(a)(1), 4.15.

Substantially gainful employment is that employment which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the Veteran resides.  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App.?356 (1991).  Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a).

The ability to work sporadically or obtain marginal employment is not substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991).  Marginal employment, where the earned annual income does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, is not considered substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

TDIU may be assigned, if the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one service-connected disability it is rated 60 percent or more; or if there are two or more service-connected disabilities at least one is rated 40 percent or more and the combined rating is 70 percent or more.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a).

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: disabilities of one or both upper extremities; or of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; disabilities affecting a single body system (such as orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric); multiple injuries incurred in action; or multiple disabilities incurred as prisoner of war.  38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a).

A claim for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability, presupposes that the rating for the service-connected disability is less than 100 percent, and only asks for TDIU because of subjective factors that the objective rating does not consider.  Vettese v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?31 (1994).  In evaluating a Veteran's employability, consideration may be given to the level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to age or impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  38?C.F.R. §§?3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The central inquiry is whether the service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability.  Hatlestad v. Brown,?5?Vet. App. 524 (1993).  Neither nonservice-connected disabilities nor advancing age may be considered in the determination.  38?C.F.R. §§?3.341, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App.?361?(1993).  The fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty finding employment is not enough, as a high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment.  The question is whether the claimant is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required for employment, not whether the claimant can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4?Vet. App.?361 (1993).

TDIU is not always a separate claim, but can be a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  TDIU can be raised at various stages of the claims process and arises when VA rates a disability.  Because TDIU can arise any time VA is rating a disability, VA may need to address TDIU as part of separate claim streams when rating different disabilities.  TDIU, when part of a claim for increase, is not a separate claim for benefits that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service connection or increased rating claim.  Rather, TDIU is part of that underlying claim, as an option for a potential rating, and the eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394 (2024).

The Appellant contends that TDIU is warranted from August 31, 2020, on the basis that TDIU is part of an underlying claim for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  The Appellant contends that TDIU is warranted on the basis that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities interfered with the ability to stand, walk, bend, and lift, and that the Veteran would therefore have been unable to secure and maintain gainful employment including sedentary employment.  The Appellant argues that sedentary employment requires two hours of standing or walking which would have been difficult for the Veteran.

As a February 2024 brief notes on behalf of the Appellant, the claim for TDIU was filed on April 18, 2022, a few weeks after the AOJ issued a rating decision establishing service connection for several rheumatoid arthritis disabilities.  The claim for TDIU was not filed while the claim for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis was pending, and therefore cannot be part of that claim.  TDIU can arise any time VA is rating a disability.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Here, no rating claim was pending, and a rating had already been assigned for the rheumatoid arthritis disabilities in the March 2022 rating decision that established service connection for those disabilities.  Consequently, the Board finds that the present claim arose from the April 18, 2022, VA Form 21-8940, which was received within a year of the valid November 8, 2021, ITF.

Prior to August 10, 2022, the Veteran's combined disability rating was 90 percent.  The service-connected disabilities included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rated 30 percent; a left shoulder disability rated 20 percent; a right shoulder disability rated 20 percent; a left hand thumb disability rated 10 percent; a right hand thumb disability rated 10 percent; a left hand long finger disability rated 10 percent; a right hand long finger disability rated 10 percent; a left hand index finger disability rated 10 percent; a right hand index finger disability rated 10 percent; a left foot disability rated 10 percent; a right foot disability rated 10 percent; a left ankle disability rated 0 percent prior to April 18, 2022, and 10 percent as of April 18, 2022; tinnitus rated 10 percent; bilateral hearing loss rated 0 percent; a left hand ring finger disability rated 0 percent; a right hand ring finger disability rated 0 percent; a left hand little finger disability rated 0 percent;  a right hand little finger disability rated 0 percent; and a left eyelid scar rated 0 percent.

The Veteran's arthritis disabilities are all related to rheumatoid arthritis, and thus stem from a common etiology or a single systemic disability, and yield a combined rating of at least 40 percent, with an overall combined service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or more.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Schedular requirements for TDIU are met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

A November 2003 service separation form notes that the Veteran's primary specialty was Security Forces Craftsman for 20 years and 11 months.  That form also notes a 256 hour security police specialist course, 51 hours of non-commissioned officer preparatory course, a nine week ground launch cruise missile defense force course, a two week information security management course, one week introduction to acquisition management course, six week non-commissioned officer course, seven week senior non-commissioned officer course, one week dynamics of international terrorism course, and a 40-hour operations security practitioner's course.

At a November 2021 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination, the Veteran reported that communication was difficult at times due to hearing loss, especially in the presence of background noise.  The Veteran reported that tinnitus had no impact on occupational functioning.

At a February 2022 VA examination for foot disabilities, the Veteran reported pain when bending, lifting, standing, walking, driving, and holding the steering wheel, as well as pain when going to the dentist.  The Veteran indicated the pain would affect jobs requiring bending, lifting, standing, walking, driving, holding a steering wheel, and the like.  The examiner emphasized in the remarks section that no evidence of pain was observed on passive motion, active motion, weight-bearing motion, nonweight-bearing motion, or on rest/non-movement.

Also in February 2022, VA systemic arthritis, hand, and shoulder examinations were conducted.  The functional impact section documents the same impact as the Veteran reported at the foot examination.

At a February 2022 VA examination, an examiner found that the Veteran's PTSD manifested with symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events.  The examiner found that the Veteran's PTSD would result in occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation.  The Veteran reported difficulty dealing with strangers and making new friends and denied having any friends aside from 4 to 5 friends that were former coworkers.  The Veteran was appropriately dressed, pleasant, alert, and cooperative, conversational speech was normal, comprehension was good, thought processes were logical, and social interaction was appropriate.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's affect was anxious while discussing trauma but otherwise neutral and appropriate.

On the April 2022 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran listed most or all of the service-connected disabilities as preventing the Veteran from securing and maintaining gainful employment.  The Veteran reported having last worked in May 2017 as a background investigator and having completed two years of college education and obtained an associate degree in applied science security administration.  The Veteran stated that working as a background investigator required a lot of writing, and rheumatoid arthritis swelling affected the ability to move, including the ability to type, write, and talk.  The Veteran reported having to stay home for two or three days during an attack.

In May 2022, a former employer indicated that the Veteran was employed from January 2016 to May 2018, and had last worked in May 2018.  No other information was provided.  The Veteran also submitted a November 2015 email received by a friend who referred the Veteran for that position and received a referral bonus as a result.

At a July 2022 VA ankle examination, the Veteran's left ankle fracture residual disability, status post lateral malleolar fracture without residual impairment, was found to manifest with no symptoms.  The Veteran reported experiencing intermittent pain.  The examiner found that the left ankle disability would not impact the Veteran's ability to perform any type of occupational task.

As reviewed above, the evidence shows that the Veteran has had two years of college education and earned an associate degree.  The Veteran's specific education, training, and employment experience indicate that the Veteran was capable of a variety of forms of employment that required learning and applying technical skills, interacting with the public and other employees, managing other employees, and completing administrative tasks, even considering the physical limitations resulting from the service-connected disabilities.  Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139 (2018).  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not working during the period on appeal.

The Board defines sedentary work in the context of this particular case as work involving relatively little exercise or physical activity.  The Board does not give substantial weight to the argument that sedentary employment requires two hours of standing or walking.  Employment exists on a spectrum of physicality.  There are certainly jobs or occupations that do not require two hours of walking per day and also those that do not require two hours of standing or walking per day.  Additionally, for a job requiring two hours of standing per day, reasonable accommodations would likely have been available to allow the Veteran to sit as necessitated by disability symptoms.  The Veteran has reported difficulty typing, driving, or standing for long periods of time when the rheumatoid arthritis disability was acting up.  Many sedentary jobs require varying amounts of typing, but speech-to-text software would allow the Veteran to greatly reduce the amount of typing performed while still accomplishing the same tasks.  The Board notes that driving is common, but other modes of transportation are available to reach potential worksites even if the service-connected disabilities precluded all driving.  The Board finds that the Veteran was capable of performing the physical tasks necessary for some types of sedentary employment.  

In the context of the Veteran's work history, after service the Veteran has reported working as a background investigator.  The Board notes that the Veteran had experience in service managing people as a high-ranking non-commissioned officer and likely interacted with individuals extensively while working as a background investigator.  A February 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran's PTSD manifested with occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation.  The February 2022 VA examiner did not find that the Veteran had difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances including work or a work-like setting, or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  The Veteran reported having four to five long-time friends and keeping in touch regularly.  The weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran was capable of interacting with people, customers, coworkers, subordinates, and others, and was capable of the mental tasks required to secure and maintain gainful employment.  As an individual with an associate degree and experience managing people, the Veteran was likely capable of securing and maintaining a variety of sedentary jobs.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran reported difficulty with strangers and having no friends.  However, in the same sentence reporting no friends, the Veteran endorsed having four or five friends that were former coworkers.  The Board finds that the weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran was able to interact with people, including strangers, such as the February 2022 VA examiner, and was able to maintain relationships, as evidenced by having multiple friends and having received a job referral from a friend.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim and the evidence is not in approximate balance.  The Board finds that there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Appellant.  As the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to service-connected disabilities prior to August 10, 2022, the claim for TDIU must be denied.  Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
