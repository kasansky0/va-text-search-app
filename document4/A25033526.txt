ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of October 25, 2013, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due solely to service-connected schizophrenia, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of October 25, 2013, but no earlier, for the award of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The issue of TDIU was raised by the record while the underlying claim for schizophrenia was pending.

2. The Veteran's service-connected schizophrenia alone precluded him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment from at least October 25, 2013.

3. From October 25, 2013, the Veteran had a combined permanent total evaluation for TDIU and is eligible for DEA benefits.

4. The Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss was manifested by no worse than Level III hearing acuity in the right ear and no worse than Level III hearing acuity in the left ear during the entire period on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an award of TDIU based solely on schizophrenia beginning October 25, 2013, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16, 4.25. 

2. The criteria for an effective date of October 25, 2013, but no earlier, for eligibility to DEA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3510, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807, 21.3021.

3. The criteria for an initial compensable initial rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service in the United States Navy from December 1964 to December 1968.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in June 2024 and September 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On October 18, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 and September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

Unless otherwise specifically provided in Chapter 51 of Title 38 of the United States Code, the effective date of an award based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The effective date shall be the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim or the date on which entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), the effective date of an increase in a veteran's disability compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application. Section 5110 (b)(2) provides an exception to this general rule: the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the application is received within one year from such date.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and VA's General Counsel have interpreted the laws and regulations pertaining to the effective date for an increase as follows: if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was factually ascertainable. If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, claims must be filed on standard forms, eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.150, 3.155, 3.160(a). Instead of informal claims, the new regulation provides that a claimant may request an application for benefits, upon receipt of which, the Secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) saved electronic application when an application otherwise meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system, (ii) written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary, and (iii) oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel, recorded in writing, and documented in the claimant's records.

Entitlement to a TDIU prior to April 24, 2024.

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. If the total rating is based on a disability or combination of disabilities for which the Schedule for Rating Disabilities provides an evaluation of less than 100 percent, it must be determined that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age. 38 C.F.R. § 3.341(a). In evaluating total disability, full consideration must be given to unusual physical or mental effects in individual cases, to peculiar effects of occupational activities, to defects in physical or mental endowment preventing the usual amount of success in overcoming the handicap of disability and to the effects of combinations of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.15.

The fact that a veteran may be unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not determinative. The ultimate question is whether the Veteran, because of service-connected disability, is incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). In making its determination, VA considers such factors as the extent of the service-connected disabilities, and employment and educational background. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16 (b), 4.19.

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

The grant of a TDIU is an award of increased disability compensation for purposes of assigning an effective date. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). The assignment of effective dates for increased ratings is governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected disabilities render him unable to work, and that he is entitled to TDIU prior to April 24, 2024.

The initial question in this case is whether filing the April 2024 VA Form 21-8940 amounted to filing a "supplemental claim" for the purposes of continuous pursuit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Recently, the Court held that a VA Form 21-8940 can be a supplemental claim, although not filed on the supplemental claim form (VA Form 20-0995), when the VA Form 21-8940 is filed after VA has denied higher ratings for the disabilities at issue. See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028 (Vet. App. 2025). Here, a January 2024 rating decision deferred the issue of TDIU and granted service connection for schizophrenia effective October 25, 2013. Then, an April 2024 rating decision denied entitlement to TDIU, and the Veteran filed the April 2024 VA Form 21-8940. TDIU was granted with an effective date of April 24, 2024, in a September 2024 rating decision, and the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in September 2024 appealing the effective date of TDIU. Under the Court's ruling in Chisholm, the Board finds that the Veteran established continuous pursuit with the April 2024 VA Form 21-8940, thus bridging the gap between the January 2024 and April 2024 rating decisions, and the September 2024 rating decision. See Chisholm, supra; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Further, entitlement to TDIU was contended during the course of the Veteran's claim seeking service connection for schizophrenia, which was ultimately granted. See also August 2022 private treatment record (discussing how the Veteran's schizophrenia affected his employability). Accordingly, the Board finds that TDIU was raised as part of this underlying claim pursuant to the Court's ruling in Rice. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). As discussed above, the Veteran separately continuously pursued the issue of TDIU after it was decided separately by the AOJ in the January 2024 and April 2024 rating decisions. Therefore, the period on appeal for the issue of TDIU attaches to the underlying claim for service connection for schizophrenia, which was ultimately granted, beginning October 25, 2013. See October 2013 VA Form 21-4138.

Having established the date of claim, the analysis turns to whether the Veteran met the requirements for TDIU for the time period prior to April 24, 2024.

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities are schizophrenia rated at 70 percent from October 25, 2013, 100 percent from August 30, 2022, and 70 percent from September 21, 2023; tinnitus rated at 10 percent from October 19, 2022; and bilateral hearing loss rated at 0 percent from October 19, 2022. Thus, the schedular criteria for TDIU have been met since October 25, 2013, both generally and based solely on his service-connected schizophrenia. Finally, the record reflects that the Veteran has been unemployed throughout the period on appeal. See January 2020 VA examination; August 2022 private treatment record. 

The record shows that the Veteran was a welder for approximately 19 years until he hurt his back on the job in 1988. See August 2022 private treatment record. The Veteran reported that he was forced to retire after a back injury, but that his psychiatric disorder was also interfering with his overall work performance, efficiency, and reliability at that time. Id. 

The Veteran submitted a private medical examination regarding his psychiatric disorder. See August 2022 private treatment record. The private evaluator discussed how the Veteran's psychiatric condition affected his employability. The Veteran reported that at the time of the examination, he lived a sedentary lifestyle at home and tended to isolate, withdraw, and avoid social interactions and activities. He did not do much regarding household chores but could help with some light chores. His siblings would do most of the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and maintenance around the house. The examiner stated that it was his opinion that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms have continued uninterrupted with increased severity and symptomatology since their onset. With regards to employability specifically, the examiner stated that the Veteran was prescribed highly "sedating" medications since at least 1990. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition, debilitating medical conditions, and substance abuse self-medication tendencies would "certainly at least as likely as not preclude him" from sustaining any form of gainful, meaningful employment at least as early as 1988 to present.

The Veteran was afforded three VA examinations with regards to his service-connected psychiatric condition. At the January 2020 VA examination, the examiner marked that the Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. At that examination, the Veteran reported that he took part in household chores and was able to drive himself in-town, but not out of town. The Veteran's symptoms were noted to be chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, and persistent delusions or hallucinations. At the September 2023 VA examination, the examiner marked occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation. The examiner listed the Veteran's symptoms as depressed mood, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, and persistent delusions or hallucinations. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not exhibit any problems with judgment, thinking, or communication. At the July 2024 VA examination, the examiner also marked occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation. The examiner noted mild memory loss and persistent delusions or hallucinations as the symptoms of the Veteran's psychiatric conditions.

The Veteran's post service treatment records show that the Veteran lived with his siblings. See October 2013 VA treatment record; June 2015 VA treatment record. Throughout the period on appeal the Veteran reported some sleep issues and that he would get irritable at times. See October 2013 VA treatment record. Generally, the treatment records throughout the period on appeal would state that the Veteran exhibited "fair" insight and judgment. See April 2014 VA treatment record. Similarly, the records reflect that the Veteran's depression and chronic auditory hallucinations were controlled by medications. See March 2016 VA treatment record; June 2016 VA treatment record; October 2017 VA treatment record; February 2019 VA treatment record; March 2022 VA treatment record. The Veteran was able to drive, but it was limited. See March 2019 VA treatment record. The Veteran was independent in basic activities of daily living. See June 2020 VA treatment record.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's representative submitted a vocational report in December 2024. In preparing the vocational report, the examiner interviewed the Veteran. The Veteran described both physical and psychological issues with work. The examiner concluded that it was more likely than not that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow any substantially gainful employment since at least 1988 due to his service-connected disabilities. Unfortunately, both the vocational report and its cover letter reference a list of service-connected disabilities which do not align with the current service-connected disabilities for this particular veteran. The Veteran's currently service-connected disabilities are listed above; however, both the cover letter and vocational report add a back condition and a right knee disability. Further, they both mischaracterize the Veteran's psychiatric disorder, list the wrong effective dates, and state that the Veteran's hearing loss is rated 20 percent disabling while the correct rating is noncompensable. Since the report's conclusion, and the vocational report itself, is predicated on disabilities which are not actually service-connected for this veteran, the Board affords the report minimal probative value.

Still, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise that the Veteran's service-connected schizophrenia alone has precluded him from being able to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment since at least October 25, 2013, when the schedular criteria for TDIU were met. The record reflects that the Veteran has been unemployed throughout the period on appeal. The Board finds at least as much probative value in the August 2022 private evaluator's opinion as the three VA examinations. In his opinion, the examiner acknowledged the Veteran's prior substance abuse but stated that it was a secondary form of self-medication and an irrational attempt to cope with his psychiatric disorder. 

Also, the examiner discussed the Veteran's other nonservice-connected medical conditions as part of what made the Veteran unemployable; however, the totality of the examiner's opinion shows that the Veteran's psychiatric condition alone would preclude employability. For example, the private evaluator stated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition was interfering with his ability to work when he stopped working in 1988, and the examiner stated that the Veteran's psychiatric condition persisted uninterrupted and increased in severity since its onset. The three VA examinations, on the other hand, are also probative but were focused on the severity of the Veteran's psychiatric disability and not its impact on employability. 

Similarly, the Veteran's treatment records do not paint a clear picture of the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks. The records were from a time period over twenty years removed from the Veteran's last employment and thus do not offer sufficient information for the Board to determine the Veteran's ability to secure and follow gainful employment. Nothing in these treatment records contradicts the August 2022 private evaluator's findings. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran has been precluded from securing and following gainful employment due solely to his service-connected schizophrenia from October 25, 2013. 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102.

Additionally, the Veteran's attorney contended that the issue of TDIU was pending "before the Board" since at least 1988, and thus TDIU should be granted effective from "at least" 1988. See December 2024 attorney brief. The record contains no formal claim for TDIU prior to April 24, 2024. Further, the present underlying psychiatric claim was filed on October 25, 2013. See October 2013 VA Form 21-4138. Similarly, October 25, 2013, was the date that the Veteran met the schedular criteria for TDIU, and he had no service-connected disabilities prior to that date. Accordingly, the Board finds that the effective date of entitlement to TDIU should be October 25, 2013, but no earlier, the effective date for service-connection of the underlying psychiatric claim pursuant to the Court's ruling in Rice.

Finally, SMC at the housebound rate is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). This requirement is met when the Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises, or if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). A TDIU rating can satisfy the need for a rating of 100 percent if it can be sustained by a single disability. Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250-51 (2011). In such instances, if a veteran also has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more or is permanently housebound by reason of his service-connected disabilities, the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate would be met. See Guerra v. Shinseki, 642 F.3d 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2011). 

In this case, the Veteran's only other service-connected disabilities are tinnitus rated at 10 percent and bilateral hearing loss rated at 0 percent. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the Veteran is permanently housebound due to his service-connected disabilities. In fact, the Veteran has repeatedly stated that he could drive. See March 2019 VA treatment record; June 2020 VA treatment record. Accordingly, the Board has considered whether SMC at the housebound rate is warranted and finds that it is not warranted at this time.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 24, 2024, for DEA.

For purposes of eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a).

A September 2024 rating decision granted TDIU and eligibility to DEA based on the granting of TDIU in that same decision effective April 24, 2024. The effective date for eligibility to DEA is the same as the effective date of TDIU as that is the effective date of the evidence showing the Veteran has total service-connected disabilities which are permanent in nature. 

Given the Board's decision above to grant entitlement to TDIU from October 25, 2013, entitlement to DEA also arose on October 25, 2013. An effective date of October 25, 2013, for the award of DEA is granted.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned specific diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999).

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability warrants a compensable rating. Following the Board's December 2023 decision on an appeal stemming from an April 2023 rating decision, which denied a compensable rating for hearing loss, the Veteran submitted a March 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, to again contend that a compensable rating is warranted. The June 2024 rating decision on appeal in the current docket continued the noncompensable rating, and the Veteran appealed.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII. 

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

A March 2023 VA examination conducted testing of the Veteran's hearing. Puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:   

	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25	40	50	60

LEFT	10	25	30	35

Puretone decibel averages for the thresholds 1000 Hertz to 4000 Hertz were 43.75 in the right ear and 25 in the left ear. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85. The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score was 80 percent in each ear.

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level III in the right ear and Level III in the left ear. Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level III for the right ear and Level III for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 0 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

A June 2024 VA examination conducted testing of the Veteran's hearing. Puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:   

	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25	35	55	55

LEFT	10	30	30	40

Puretone decibel averages for the thresholds 1000 Hertz to 4000 Hertz were 43 in the right ear and 28 in the left ear. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85. The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score was 82 percent in each ear.

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level III in the right ear and Level III in the left ear. Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level III for the right ear and Level III for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a 0 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100. An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

Based on the evidence above, both the March 2023 and June 2024 VA examinations show a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence and other narrative evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including the September 2023 Veteran statement and March 2024 private treatment record. The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing; however, disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The functional impact of hearing loss is contemplated by the rating criteria. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). Similarly, reduced hearing acuity and clarity are what is contemplated in the rating assigned. See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hearing loss. The appeal is denied. The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because otherwise the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of higher ratings. 38 U.S.C. §5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
