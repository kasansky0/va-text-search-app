ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating for restrictive lung disease is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for pulmonary fibrosis is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for granulomatous disease is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for emphysema is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for sarcoidosis is dismissed. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for restrictive lung disease and denied service connection for emphysema, granulomatous disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis.

2. In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, requesting higher level review of the May 2023 rating decision.

3. An August 2023 higher-level review decision identified a duty to assist error in the Veteran's claims for an increased rating for restrictive lung disease and service connection for emphysema, granulomatous disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. 

4. In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the August 2023 HLR decision. 

5. The May 2024 VA Form 10182 was premature, as the August 2023 HLR decision did not adjudicate the issues on appeal.

After the AOJ adjudicates a veteran's claim, the veteran has one year to file a request for a higher-level review at the AOJ, a supplemental claim, or review by the Board. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  

Current regulations prohibit concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different appeal lanes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b). Furthermore, a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (emphasis added). Accordingly, multiple administrative review requests "pending concurrently" would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A); Terry, 37 Vet. App. at 3 

In the August 2023 higher-level review decision, the AOJ identified duty to assist errors with respect to the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for restrictive lung disease and claims of service connection for emphysema, granulomatous disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. The AOJ stated that the claims would be developed to obtain VA examinations and/or opinions.

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 as to that August rating decision; however, the AOJ has not adjudicated the claims in the August 2023 higher-level review decision that was appealed. Since a decision was not rendered in the August 2023 higher-level review decision, his appeals with respect to the issues of an increased rating for restrictive lung disease and service connection for emphysema, granulomatous disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis in the May 2024 VA Form 10182 was premature. Under AMA, there are three review lanes: Higher-Level Review (HLR), Supplemental Claim, and Board Appeal. If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b), (d), (e); 20.205. No such withdrawal has taken place here. 

The Board notes the legal finding that these issues were adjudicated in February 2025. The Veteran still has time to properly appeal these issues and should review the February 2025 notice letter and appeal rights. 

Accordingly, the appeal with respect to determination that a duty to assist error has been identified during the higher-level review for the claims of an increased rating for restrictive lung disease and service connection for restrictive lung disease, emphysema, granulomatous disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis are dismissed as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201.
