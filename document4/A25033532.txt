ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition, to include as due to a service-connected left knee disability, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left hip condition to include as due to a service-connected left knee disability, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right shoulder condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder condition are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 , 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102 , 3.30

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to August 1999.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder condition 

The Veteran contends he has a right shoulder condition that is due to service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a right shoulder condition and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). 

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of a right shoulder disability and is competent to observe lay symptoms, he does not have the training or credentials to provide a competent opinion as to a diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence failing to show a diagnosis, and the appeal must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition, to include as due to a service-connected left knee disability

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip condition to include as due to a service-connected left knee disability

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA hip and thigh conditions examination and opinion in September 2023. However, there are no opinions of record that discusses the second prong of secondary service connection. The Board finds the September 2023 VA opinion inadequate due to failing to address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 91 (2018) (causation and aggravation are independent concepts and should have separate findings and rationale); El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013) (findings of "not due to," "not caused by" and "not related to" a service-connected disability are insufficient to address the question of aggravation under § 3.310(b)).

Additionally, the examiner provided an opinion regarding both hips. However, on the disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ), the examiner did not indicate a diagnosis of a right hip condition, but did indicate a left hip strain. It is unclear as to whether the Veteran has a right hip condition. In the examiner's rationale, she reported the Veteran's records are silent for complaints, diagnosis, and treatment for bilateral hip condition. The examiner went on to state that knee conditions can cause hip conditions, but the medical records are insufficient to relate the two conditions. 

The Board finds that the VA opinion and examination are inadequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA undertakes an examination, it must provide an adequate one); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding lack of contemporaneous medical records does not serve as an "absolute bar" to the service connection claim). 

Thus, the Board finds remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error by providing an inadequate VA examination and opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a new VA examination and opinion to determine the nature and likely etiology of the claimed bilateral hip disabilities. The entire claims file must be reviewed by the examiner. All indicated tests and studies should be performed, and the clinical findings should be reported in detail. The examiner should address the following:

a.) First, identify and provide diagnoses of any right and left hip disabilities separately.   Then address whether it is it at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's right and/or left hip disabilities are due to the Veteran's active service. 

b.) Whether it is it at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) that the Veteran's right and/or left hip disabilities were (i) caused or (ii) aggravated by the service-connected left knee disability. 

The Board notes that causation and aggravation are independent concepts and should have separate findings and rationales. See Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018). The examiner is reminded that there is NO requirement of "permanent aggravation"; rather, the Board seeks to determine whether there was aggravation in general.

All opinions offered must be accompanied by a clear rationale consistent with the evidence of record.
