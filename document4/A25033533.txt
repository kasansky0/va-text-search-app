REMANDED

Entitlement to a non-initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 25, 2022, for a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected asthma is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2003 to December 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of increased rating for asthma and earlier effective date for the same, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a non-initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected asthma is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his current 30 percent disability rating for his asthma does not accurately reflect the severity of his condition.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2022 related to his condition. However, the results of his pulmonary function test (PFT) were not made available at the May 2022 examination. The Veteran was then subsequently scheduled for July 2022 to conduct the PFT, but the examination was cancelled at the request of the Veteran. The Veteran then attended another examination in August 2022. However, the results from the Veteran's PFT's were never added to the Veteran's claims file despite several communications from the AOJ to the examiner for the PFT results. The Veteran has stated that the AOJ accused the Veteran of not attending the August 2022 examination. However, there is no indication in the rating decisions addressing the Veterans asthma claim that he did not attend the examination. On the contrary, a review of the record indicates that the test results were pending for some time but were not ultimately recorded on the Veteran's disability benefit questionnaire form. See August 2022 correspondence and September 2022 report of general information.

These PFT results are material to the Board in making its decision as the PFT results can affect the Veteran's disability rating. The failure of the AOJ to add these results constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, requiring a remand to locate these records and add them to the Veteran's claims file.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 25, 2022, for a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected asthma is remanded.

The Board finds that the effective date of the Veteran's claim is inextricably intertwined with Veteran's increased rating claim. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (the prohibition against the adjudication of claims that are inextricably intertwined is based upon the recognition that claims related to each other should not be subject to piecemeal decision-making or appellate litigation). Accordingly, it must be remanded as well.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The Veteran's May 2022 VA examination for respiratory conditions does not contain the results of the Veteran's pulmonary function test (PFT). Obtain the Veteran's PFT results for the May 2022 VA examination. The Veteran may have had a follow up to this examination in August 2022. Reasonable efforts should be made to obtain any examination which occurred Between May 2022 and September 2022 related to the Veteran's asthma condition.
