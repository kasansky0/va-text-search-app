REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral leg condition, to include as secondary to service connected sleep apnea, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve, with periods of active duty from June 1998 to July 2000, September 2005 to February 2006, and September 2022 to July 2023. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

The Board notes that subsequent to the February 2024 decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the February 2024 decision.  In June 2024, the AOJ issued a HLR decision, which continued the denial of service connection for a bilateral leg condition.  While the Veteran's appeal to the Board is timely to both the February and June 2024 decisions, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 indicates he was appealing the February 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board finds that the February 2024 decision is on appeal.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran indicated disagreement with the issues of entitlement to service connection for hypertension and a left elbow arthritis and tendonitis decided in a March 2018 rating decision in the June 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, the utilization of a VA Form 10182 for a rating decision issued prior to February 19, 2019 would be improper for the filing of a legacy Notice of Disagreement and the appeal was not timely submitted.  Additionally, the Veteran did not provide good cause for doing so and did not request an extension.  Consequently, the Board finds that the issues of entitlement to service connection for hypertension and left elbow arthritis and tendonitis are not currently on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202.

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral leg condition, to include as secondary to service connected sleep apnea, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a bilateral leg condition, to include as secondary to service connected sleep apnea.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-526.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that in the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded the Veteran was diagnosed with a current disability, diagnosed a bilateral restless leg syndrome, and that he is service connected for sleep apnea.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of either a pre-decisional duty to assist error or any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board finds that remand is necessary for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  When VA obtains an examination and/or opinion, it must ensure that such is adequate.? See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007).? For a medical examination and opinion to be adequate, it must be: (1) based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) be the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) be the result of principles and methods reliably applied to the facts.?See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 302 (2008).  

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in March and December 2023 that confirmed he has a diagnosis of restless leg syndrome that was diagnosed in 2021.  See March and December 2023 VA examinations.  The Veteran reported he had been dealing with restless leg syndrome for years that was confirmed during a sleep study.  See March 2023 VA examination.  A September 2021 sleep study noted the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and periodic limb movement disorder.  The sleep study indicated the Veteran had periodic limb movements.  See September 2021 sleep study.  An April 2022 treatment record notes the Veteran's report of legs twitching or kicking. 

The Veteran was most recently afforded a VA examination in February 2024 which confirmed a diagnosis of restless leg syndrome.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's restless leg syndrome was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected condition.  See February 2024 VA medical opinion.  As rationale, the VA examiner noted that while periodic limb movement disorder and restless leg syndrome are often comorbid with sleep apnea and observed during sleep studies, there is not strong support in medical literature for the notion that sleep apnea causes restless leg syndrome.  Id.  However, the VA examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's restless leg syndrome is aggravated (worsened) by his service connected sleep apnea.  The AOJ's failure to provide an adequate medical opinion, including a clear secondary aggravation medical opinion, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and remand is necessary to obtain an addendum medical opinion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802; see also El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013); Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 90-91 (2018); Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 302; Stegall, 11 Vet. App. at 271.

The Board notes the VA examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's bilateral restless leg syndrome is directly related to his service.  The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints, diagnoses, or treatment for any symptoms related to his bilateral restless leg syndrome.  The Veteran's claims file, including VA and private treatment records, do not indicate the Veteran's restless leg syndrome is directly related to his service.  Additionally, the Veteran has not provided any evidence to indicate that his bilateral restless leg syndrome is directly related to his service.  Moreover, though the Veteran served during the Gulf War, the record does not demonstrate the Veteran had any service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations.  The Veteran's DD Form 214 from his first service noted overseas service and his military personnel records demonstrate he served in Korea.  The DD Forms 214 for his other periods of active duty service do not demonstrate any foreign or sea service.  Consequently, there is no indication the Veteran had any toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) during his service, to include due to any service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, and a TERA medical opinion is not required.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1).  Therefore, the Board finds that a VA medical opinion addressing direct service connection would not be warranted as the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran's bilateral restless leg syndrome is directly related to his military service.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the record and a copy of this Remand to a clinician for completion of an addendum medical opinion regarding the Veteran's bilateral restless leg syndrome.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination only if one is required by the clinician.  After reviewing the Veteran's claims file, the clinician should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that his bilateral restless leg syndrome was aggravated (worsened) by service connected sleep apnea.

2. A complete rationale should be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical evidence and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.
