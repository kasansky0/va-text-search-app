ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left ankle degenerative arthritis is granted. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also claimed as an esophageal condition, is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis is a result of his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection of the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113; 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1993 to April 1993, and on active duty for training in April 1997, with additional National Guard service. See DPRIS Records; Service Treatment Records.

The decision on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from the regional office (referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)), was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) in October 2023 seeking service connection for his left ankle disability (recharacterized by the AOJ as left ankle degenerative arthritis), and the AOJ deferred the claim for further development in November 2023.

In December 2023 the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ (Claim) seeking service connection for his GERD disability and then filed an additional Claim for GERD, claimed as an esophageal condition, in January 2024. 

The AOJ denied both the left ankle degenerative arthritis and the GERD claims in January 2024. The Veteran then submitted VA Form 10182 in February 2024 (Notice of Disagreement), indicating the January 2024 decision, and noting the left ankle and GERD disabilities; and selecting direct review of his claim. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the GERD claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes the Veteran submitted a bilateral foot disability claim in September 2021 (denied in November 2021), and the Veteran's VA treatment records include overlapping notations for his left ankle degenerative arthritis and the claimed bilateral foot condition. However, the bilateral foot disability is not on review and will not be addressed. See September 2021 21-526EZ; November 2021 Rating Decision; October 2021 VA Examination.

Service Connection

The Veteran contends he injured his left ankle when navigating stairs while training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in April 1997. See April 1997 Service Treatment Records. The Veteran self-treated the injury with ice and ointment before seeking additional medical treatment. The Veteran contends he was not able to treat the injury properly at the time, which caused his mobility to worsen post-service. Additionally, he has continuing pain which makes it difficult to stand for eight hours without resting; and at times, his left ankle will "go out" causing him to fall. The Veteran wears a brace daily, and he has left ankle pain "on and off." See October 2023 Lay Statement; January 2024 VA Treatment Records.  

The Veteran's Representative, Disabled American Veterans, contends the Veteran has a current disability, stemming from the April 1997 accident during training, and the Veteran's medical evidence demonstrates the Veteran has mild left ankle degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis). See March 2024 Brief. The Board notes the Representative characterized the Veteran's dates of service as November 1983 to June 1992. However, the Veteran's service records demonstrate he entered the National Guard in December 1992 and was discharged in December 1998, with active-duty service from January 1993 to April 1993, and active duty for training in April 1997. See Service Treatment Records. 

As the Veteran was granted service connection for tinnitus based on injuries incurred, in part, during his April 1997 period of active duty for training, Veteran status has been established for VA compensation purposes.

Relevant Legal Principals

To establish service connection, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d. 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Additionally, service connection is granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Certain chronic diseases (such as arthritis) will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The presumption for chronic diseases relaxes the evidentiary requirements for establishing entitlement to service connection. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338 (holding that "[t]he clear purpose of [subsection 3.303(b)] is to relax the requirements of § 3.303(a) for establishing service connection for certain chronic diseases" and only applies to the chronic diseases set forth in §3.309(a)). As noted, § 3.303(b) provides that when a chronic disease is established during active service, then subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, will be entitled to service connection, unless clearly attributable to causes unrelated to service ("intercurrent causes"). If the evidence is not sufficient to show that the disease was chronic at the time of service, then the claim may be established with evidence of a continuity of symptoms after service, which is a distinct and lesser evidentiary burden than the nexus element of the three-part test under Shedden. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Showing a continuity of symptoms after service itself "establishes the link, or nexus" to service and also "confirm[s] the existence of the chronic disease while in service or [during a] presumptive period."

A finding that a disease is chronic in service requires "a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word 'Chronic.'" 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b). And the presumption of service connection arises if the disease is manifested to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service. This presumption is rebuttable by probative evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). 

When the VA provides an examination, it must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310-11 (2007). For a medical opinion to be adequate, the opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can weigh, and a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007). 

A VA medical opinion must address direct service connection when presumptive service connection is not warranted. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994). And a medical nexus opinion finding a disability is not related to service simply because the condition is not entitled to presumptive service connection, without first considering direct service connection, is inadequate on its face. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-24 (2007). Moreover, before the Board can rely on an absence of documentation in the record to draw inferences disproving service connection, a proper foundation must first be established. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015). 

Lay statements made by a Veteran can be competent and credible when they relate to evidence derived from the witnesses own personal knowledge and limited to what the witness has observed through the senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

Further, medical evidence is not required to resolve questions of medical etiology or medical diagnosis, rather, the Board must consider lay evidence, giving it the weight the Board finds appropriate. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding a Veteran is competent to self-diagnose certain disabilities when the Veteran can identify it and the disability, or symptoms of the disability, can be ascertained through the senses.) Moreover, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Finally, the Board must determine whether the evidence supports the Veteran's claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate balance" (meaning nearly equal) between evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Facts and Analysis

The AOJ found the Veteran has left ankle degenerative arthritis and the injury was incurred in-service. See January 2024 Rating Decision. Because elements one and two are met (current disability and in-service occurrence), the question then becomes whether the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis was caused by his service (the nexus element). Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d. 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The relevant evidence of record includes a VA examination in January 2024, service treatment records, and VA Treatment records. 

Beginning with the January 2024 VA examination, the examiner notes the Veteran injured his left ankle in-service as described above. And October 2023 x-rays demonstrate left ankle mild degenerative joint disease (arthritis). See January 2024 VA Examination. The examiner notes the Veteran's reports of difficulty standing for prolonged periods, and that the Veteran exhibits pain on examination. 

However, the examiner concludes the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness; and explains that although the Veteran's service treatment records note the left ankle injury in 1997 " there are no other treatment records until decades after service, so no nexus for chronicity can be established and therefore [the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis is] less than likely due to in-service events. See January 2024 VA Examination (emphasis added). As noted above, an absence of documentation in the record is insufficient to disprove service connection. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015). And the examiner fails to address direct service connection focusing instead on whether the Veteran meets the standard for a presumptive service connection. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-24 (2007). Thus, the examination is inadequate, and the Board gives it little weight. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310-11 (2007).

Prior to service, the Veteran denied bone or joint deformity, lameness, and denied any foot trouble. See December 1992 Service Treatment Records. And the Veteran's service treatment records note the injury to his left ankle in-service during training in 1997. See April 1997 Service Treatment Records. Although his service treatment records indicate he was fully fit in October 1997, his VA Treatment records demonstrate he complained of left ankle pain in January 2022, May 2023, and continuing ankle pain from the injury in August 2023. See VA Treatment Records. 

Finally, as noted above, the Veteran contends he injured his left ankle in-service, which is corroborated by both his service treatment records and his VA treatment records. He complains of continuing pain "on and off" since the injury, which he self-treated with ice and ointment, and states his mobility has continued to worsen post-service. Additionally, there are no intercurrent causes noted in the record, and his complaints of continuing ankle pain are corroborated by his VA treatment records and lay statements. See April 1997 Service Treatment Records; VA Treatment Records; October 2023 Lay Statement. 

As noted above, the Veteran can credibly and competently report that he is in pain and report the severity of that pain. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Although the Veteran is not qualified to offer a diagnosis as to the cause of his pain, the record contains sufficient evidence demonstrating he has left ankle degenerative arthritis, including the October 2023 x-ray. Because the Veteran is consistent in his statements and they are corroborated by the record, the Board finds his lay statements to be competent and credible and gives them significant weight.

Because the Veteran's left ankle injury was noted in service, and he complains of continuing pain since service that is attributable to his left ankle degenerative arthritis, the Board finds he is entitled to the presumption for continuity of a chronic disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Thus, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis is a result of his military service. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran's left ankle degenerative arthritis is a result of his military service; and the appeal is granted. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for GERD (also claimed as esophageal condition) is remanded. 

The Veteran contends his GERD was caused when he was in basic training and "forced to eat fast." He asserts that since then he has had problems with his food "coming up." When he lays down, his food comes up and chokes him. His symptoms have progressed, and he treats them with medication. See December 2023 Claim; March 2024 Brief. 

Under the AMA, unless the claim on appeal can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error by the AOJ which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal, including those relating to VA examinations. The Board may also remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Veteran had a VA examination for his GERD in January 2024. The examiner found the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner bases the negative nexus finding on an absence of documentation in the record: the Veteran's service treatment records have only one complaint concerning his stomach from January 1993, and his VA treatment records contain GERD related complaints in 2016, 2023, and 2024. See January 2024 VA Examination. 

As noted above, an absence of documentation in the record is insufficient to disprove service connection. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015). And the opinion is conclusory as it does not adequately address the Veteran's lay complaints of stomach issues in-service and post-service. Thus, the examination is inadequate, and the Board gives it little weight. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310-11 (2007); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007); See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed GERD. If an opinion cannot be provided without an examination, the Veteran should be scheduled for a new examination. 

If the examiner determines it to be necessary, an examination should be conducted and any indicated tests, studies, or evaluations should be performed. If an examination is conducted, obtain the Veteran's detailed lay history, including onset and progression of symptomatology of his GERD. 

Based on a review of the record, and if necessary, a new examination, the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

Opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that GERD had onset during service, or is otherwise related to the Veteran's active-duty service.

A complete medical rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.

The term "at least as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility." Rather, it means that the weight of medical evidence both for and against a conclusion is so evenly divided that it is as medically sound to find in favor of the conclusion (e.g., diagnosis, etiology) as it is to find against the conclusion.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.

The examiner should also be aware that in rendering an opinion, it must "contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

Furthermore, if medical literature is relied upon in rendering this determination, the VA examiner should identify and specifically cite each reference material utilized.

Citation to accepted medical literature and principles would be of great assistance to the Board. 

If the medical professional is unable to provide any opinion without resorting to speculation, he or she must explain why this is so.
