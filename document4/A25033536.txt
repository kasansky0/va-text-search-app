ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a migraine disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's pre-existing migraine disability was permanently aggravated beyond its natural progression due to in-service injury.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right ankle disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1153, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 3.306 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service during the following periods: January 2000 to June 2000; November 2001 to September 2002; February 2003 to April 2004; and from December 2008 to January 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran also filed a January 2024, VA Form 20-0996: Request for Higher Level Review of the rating decision on appeal. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (holding that under the modernized review system, a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial agency decision, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request). A May 2024 rating decision was issued, which merely noted that upon review of the claim, a duty-to-assist (DTA) error had been identified, which required additional development to be completed. See May 2024, Rating Decision. In the Veteran's September 2024 NOD, he listed the May 2024 rating decision, along with the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, and the November 2023 rating decision as the decisions being appealed. The November 2023 rating decision did not adjudicate the merits of the claim, but merely deferred the rating pending additional development. See November 2023, Rating Decision. 

Likewise, the May 2024 rating decision was not a final, appealable action, as the identification of a duty-to-assist error in a higher-level review decision is not an adjudication of a claim on the merits, but merely advisement of the need for further development. An appeal may be initiated only once a decision on the merits is made by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Actions by the AOJ to defer a decision are not appealable decisions. See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) ("Because there is no 'final decision' when the RO issues a deferred rating decision, there has been no 'adjudicative determination' from which [a] [Notice of Disagreement] can be filed."). The finding of a DTA error in a rating decision issued by the RO, effectively defers adjudication of the merits of the claim pending further development. That claim is no longer pending as a September 2024 rating decision was issued prior to the filing of the NOD giving rise to the instant appeal. Notably, the Veteran did not appeal the September 2024 rating decision, but rather, appealed the January 2024 decision. Accordingly, the Board may proceed with appellate consideration of the claim, limited to the evidence of record as stated above. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

Service connection for migraine is denied.

The Veteran asserts that the severity of his migraine headache disability is related to his active service. 

The presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service. Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012), aff'd 749 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In this case, there is a question as to whether the Veteran's migraine disability preexisted his active service. 

In the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ identified the claimed disability as pre-existing the Veteran's active service due to the notation within the Veteran's November 1999 enlistment examination, documenting the occurrence of infrequent headaches. See November 1999, Service Treatment Record (STR). Given this unrefuted evidence, the presumption of soundness does not attach in this case as to the Veteran's migraine disability. 

In Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (2004), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held if a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder. Under such circumstances, 38 U.S.C. § 1153 applies and the burden falls on the veteran to establish an increase in disability during service. If the presumption of aggravation attaches, the burden shifts to the government to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. Id; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). 

Turning to the additional evidence of record, ongoing STRs demonstrate that the Veteran did not complain of worsening headaches or receive treatment for migraine-related symptoms. The Board finds that these records corroborate the findings from the enlistment examination report of infrequent and rare headache occurrences. 

The Veteran reports that his migraine headache disability began to worsen as a result of his deployments. See January 2024, VA Examination Report. More specifically, he avers that his overseas service, including service in Qatar, under his military occupational specialty (MOS) of aircraft mechanic, exposed him to extreme acoustic trauma as well as mental health stressors. The Veteran's injuries as to tinnitus and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been confirmed as both disabilities have been service-connected. See January 2016 and May 2024, Rating Decisions. While the Veteran's STRs may not reflect treatment for migraines or worsening migraine headaches, the Veteran has credibly reported that he self-medicated and used over-the-counter pain medications to address his symptoms. The Board finds that such treatment of the claimed disability is reasonable and consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service given his overseas deployment. 

In addition, the Board finds that the Veteran's subsequent medical treatment also supports a finding of aggravation during active service. Upon enlistment, the Veteran candidly reported the infrequent occurrence of non-severe headaches experienced approximately once per month. Following separation from service, private medical records establish that the Veteran experiences prostrating migraines at times and regularly experiences moderate to severe migraines several times per month which last, on average, 2 and 12 hours at a time. See December 2023, VA Examination Report; January 2024, Private Medical Record. 

As the evidence of record shows that there was an increase in the severity of the Veteran's migraine disability, the presumption of aggravation attaches. In order to rebut the presumption of aggravation, there must be clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. Clear and unmistakable evidence is defined as obvious or manifest. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence "cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable." Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009). 

The Board has considered the evidence of the Veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service with additional STRs also demonstrating no complaints of worsening migraine symptoms during service. However, the Board has also considered the circumstances of the Veteran's service and his overseas deployments, including foreign service in Qatar. Moreover, the Board has considered the drastic increase in severity demonstrated by a comparison of the enlistment examination report, treatment records, and most recent VA examinations. 

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that in this case, there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that there was no increase in severity or that the increase in severity was due to natural progression. Therefore, the presumption of aggravation has not been rebutted and service connection for a migraine headache disability, based upon aggravation of a pre-existing disability, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306.
