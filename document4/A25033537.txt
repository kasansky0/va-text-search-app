DOCKET NO. 240331-428019
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with cannabis use disorder and alcohol use disorder in remission (hereinafter, PTSD) is dismissed.

Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In April 2023, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD and tinnitus.  At that time, those same issues were pending adjudication before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) via a July 2022 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this appeal based on noncompliance with claims processing rules prohibiting concurrent election have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appeal is dismissed.  

The Veteran served on active duty from April to September 2005 and from April 2011 to May 2012. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), or modernized review system, a claimant may generally seek one of three available administrative review options by filing the appropriate form following adjudication of a claim. The three review options available are: (1) Higher-Level Review (HLR); (2) Supplemental Claim; and (3) Board appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Concurrent election of AMA review options is prohibited.  This means that once a claimant has filed for review under one lane (i.e., HLR, Supplemental Claim, or Board appeal), the claimant cannot seek review under a different lane while adjudication is pending in the previously selected lane.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 2-3 (2023).

Based on a full review of the claims file, the appeal is dismissed based on noncompliance with claims processing rules prohibiting concurrent election.  As explained further below, this appeal arose from an invalid April 2023 rating decision, which improperly adjudicated an April 2023 Supplemental Claim.  The April 2023 Supplemental Claim was a prohibited concurrent election of AMA review options.

By way of background, in April 2021, the Veteran filed original service connection claims for PTSD and tinnitus.  In a September 2021 rating decision, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied those claims.  

In March 2022, the Veteran timely filed a request for HLR of the September 2021 rating decision's denials of the service connection claims for PTSD and tinnitus.   In an April 2022 HLR rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the prior denial of service connection for tinnitus.  In a June 2022 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the prior denial of service connection for PTSD.  (The June 2022 rating decision indicated that although the Veteran had requested HLR in March 2022, the AOJ had processed and adjudicated the service connection claim for PTSD in the Supplemental Claim review lane because the AOJ had identified a duty to assist error.)  

In July 2022, the Veteran timely filed a Board appeal via a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) of the June 2022 rating decision (regarding the service connection claim for PTSD) and the September 2021 rating decision (regarding the service connection claim for tinnitus).  

In April 2023 - while the July 2022 Board appeal remained pending - the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, requesting review of the June 2022 rating decision (regarding the service connection claim for PTSD) and the April 2022 rating decision (regarding the service connection claim for tinnitus).  In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ adjudicated the April 2023 Supplemental Claim, confirming and continuing the prior denials of the service connection claims for PTSD and tinnitus.  

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, regarding the April 2023 rating decision's adjudication of the service connection claims for PTSD and tinnitus, giving rise to the instant appeal.

The Board finds that the present appeal is invalid because it arose from an invalid rating decision.  The April 2023 rating decision improperly adjudicated the April 2023 Supplemental Claim regarding service connection for PTSD and tinnitus. This Supplemental Claim constituted a prohibited concurrent election of AMA review options filed while the July 2022 VA Form 10182 for the same issues remained pending (i.e., not yet adjudicated) before the Board.  The law clearly prohibits such concurrent elections.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  

Therefore, this appeal is dismissed as a matter of law for noncompliance with claims processing rules.    

(Finally, the Board notes that in November 2024 - docket number 220715-260152, stemming from the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement - the Board remanded service connection claims for PTSD and tinnitus.  The AOJ then conducted development and issued a December 2024 rating decision confirming and continuing denials of those issues.  In a December 27, 2024 letter, the AOJ notified the Veteran and his representative accordingly and provided the applicable AMA review options and procedures.  If the Veteran wants to request review of the December 2024 rating decision, then the Board directs him to that letter.)
