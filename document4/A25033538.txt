FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran passed away in September 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for a waiver of the recoupment of an overpayment debt in the amount of $78,964 have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from April 1989 to April 1992. Regretfully, he passed away in September 2024. Prior to his passing, the Veteran was overpaid by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in terms of his VA benefits and was, therefore charged with an overpayment. The Veteran responded by seeking a waiver of the recoupment of his overpayment debt. This claim was denied by the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises, and the appeal at bar followed. 

However, while VA is a juridical entity that exists in perpetuity, and the charge of an overpayment is a claim that continues to exist regardless of the passing of the Veteran, the Board's in personam jurisdiction was lost once the Veteran passed away. Simply put, to continue this litigation with a possibility of recouping the debt, VA must determine whether an estate of the Veteran has come into existence, serve the estate with process, and charge the estate as if it were a new and separate debtor. Without such a charge present in the appeal at bar, the Board lacks jurisdiction in this appeal to even remand it to VA for further development. 

Accordingly, at this juncture, this appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
