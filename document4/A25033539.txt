ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, § 1131, 5107(b), 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.302, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1948 to December 1949 and from October 1950 to November 1951.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2025, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In a March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a Board hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

Service Connection

The Veteran contends that his disability is related to his military service.

In order to establish service connection for the claimed disability, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

The requirement of a current disability is" satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim."  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection if the disability is one that is listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted on the basis of a post-service initial diagnosis of a disease, where the physician relates the current condition to the period of service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).  Other specifically enumerated disorders will be presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within the first year following separation from active duty.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.309.

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).  Also significant is whether the examining medical provider had a sufficiently clear and well-reasoned rationale and a basis in objective supporting clinical data.  See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999); Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998); see also Claiborne v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 181, 186 (2005) (rejecting medical opinions that did not indicate whether the physicians actually examined the Veteran, did not provide the extent of any examination, and did not provide any supporting clinical data).

In evaluating the evidence in any given appeal, it is the responsibility of the Board to weigh the evidence and decide where to give credit and where to withhold the same and, in so doing, accept certain medical opinions over others.  Schoolman v. West, 12 Vet. App. 307, 310-11 (1999).  In this regard, the Board has been charged with the duty to assess the credibility and weight given to evidence.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F. 3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau, supra.  Indeed, the Court has declared that in adjudicating a claim, the Board has the responsibility to do so.  Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 488-89 (2000).  In doing so, the Board is free to favor one medical opinion over another, provided it offers an adequate basis for doing so.  Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).  That is, the claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in "approximate" balance, i.e., "nearly equal" but does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021)

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

As to a current diagnosis, the Board notes that the Veteran's disorder has been diagnosed as recurrent tinnitus.  See December 2024 VA examination. 

As to the in-service incurrence, the Board notes that the Veteran served as an infantryman in Korea and was exposed to acoustic trauma while on active duty. 

Turning to the medical evidence at hand, the Board notes that the Veteran attended a VA examination for this issue in December 2024.  The Veteran reported that he experiences tinnitus that causes a great distraction in conversation, making it difficult to understand words.  The examiner noted that the Veteran experiences a ringing sensation in both ears several times each day.  The examiner noted, "During his time served, the Veteran reports exposure to engine and construction noise, explosions, firearms, and battleships with 16-inch cannons.  During military service hearing protection was not used."  Following the examination, the examiner found that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely as not related to his military service.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's disability was not related to his military service because the onset of tinnitus was several years ago (2020/2021).  Also, the examiner based their opinion on the amount of time the Veteran served and the onset of the tinnitus.

The Board finds the examiner's opinion inadequate.  The Board reached this conclusion because the examiner simply found that the Veteran's disorder was not related to his service because the amount of time the Veteran served and the reported onset of the tinnitus.  Moreover, the Board does not find the fact that the Veteran did not report tinnitus symptoms earlier as conclusive evidence that the Veteran did not experience tinnitus while on active duty.

In sum, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus is warranted.  The Board notes that the Veteran has credibly reported that he experienced recurrent tinnitus in his ears since service and as such, his tinnitus may be presumed to be related to service based on continuity of symptomatology.  As was noted previously, as diseases of the nervous system, the Board finds that the Veteran's tinnitus is entitled to the application of this provision.  After a review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence, both positive and negative as to the issue of service connection for tinnitus is at least evenly balanced.  Based on the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus is therefore warranted.
