ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 22, 2010 for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The October 2023 decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) awarded an effective date of March 22, 2010 for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety; the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision implemented the October 2023 decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals, and made no appealable determination as to the matter. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to March 22, 2010 for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1985 to October 1998. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on January 9, 2024. In doing so, the Veteran asserted CUE (clear and unmistakable error) stating that the effective date for the above-described condition should go back to 2003, and in doing so, identified a November 2023 rating decision. However, in the rating decision on appeal the AOJ only addressed whether an earlier effective date under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 was possible, and did not discuss CUE. If there is no AOJ adjudication of a CUE motion raised by the Veteran, the Board does not have jurisdiction to address the issue in the first instance. A motion seeking revision on the basis of CUE is completely separate from entitlement to an earlier effective date and must be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (explaining that 38 U.S.C. § 5109A requires that a request for revision of a final AOJ decision on the basis of CUE be submitted to the AOJ for initial adjudication). An assertion of CUE is a motion or a request, not a theory of entitlement that can be considered part of another claim. See, e.g., Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011). Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that issue. The Veteran may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety is dismissed. 

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date of 2003 for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder with anxiety. 

In February 2003, the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder. The issue was last denied in an April 2007 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In an October 2023 Board decision, the Board awarded an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety to March 22, 2010. In November 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision implementing the October 2023 Board decision. In January 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety.

In the January 2024 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, the Veteran stated that he is entitled to an effective date of the original claim in 2003. He stated he was diagnosed in VA treatment records and referenced a questionnaire from 2003. 

A rating decision that implements a grant by the Board is not a decision, per se, which may be appealed. Rather, it is a ministerial action that leaves no room for choice or discretion. Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023) (citing 38 U.S.C. § 511, Griffin v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 288 F.3d 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2002), Love v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 336 (2022)). Here, the Veteran's January 2024 Supplemental Claim Application is challenging the November 2023 AOJ rating decision implementing the October 2023 Board decision. Therefore, the January 2023 Supplemental Claim Application functions as an appeal of the November 2023 AOJ rating decision. As discussed supra, there is no basis on which the Veteran may appeal the November 2023 rating decision to the Board. Thus, the present appeal to the Board regarding the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety must be dismissed.

In Encarnacion, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that the Board must determine whether an attempt to appeal a rating decision that implements a Board decision constitutes a timely motion for reconsideration of the Board decision. Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023). Here, the Board finds that such an attempt does not constitute a motion for reconsideration. Specifically, as this appeal is in the modernized appeal system, the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application cannot be liberally read as a motion for reconsideration of the October 2023 Board decision. The claimant in Encarnacion was unrepresented, and the Veteran in this case is represented by a state veteran's service organization. Such a representative may assist the Veteran with an appeal of a Board decision to the Court or the filing of a motion for reconsideration that complies with 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002. The January 2024 Supplemental Claim does not mention the Board decision, nor does it allege any errors of fact or law made in the Board decision or in the implementing rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002. Therefore, it cannot be liberally read as a motion for reconsideration of the October 2023 Board decision.  

To the extent that the Veteran contends that the 2003 claim included documentation for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and was erroneously denied, the correct vehicle to challenge the prior decisions in 2004 and 2007 would be to seek revision of those earlier decisions based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE). In this case, however, the Veteran did not assert such in the January 2024 Supplemental Claim Application.

Accordingly, as the Board does not have jurisdiction to review this appeal, the claim as to the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for bipolar schizoaffective disorder and anxiety, effective March 22, 2010, must be dismissed.
