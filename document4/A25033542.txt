FINDING OF FACT

On October 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that he requested a withdrawal of this appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force with active duty from October 1972 to December 1982.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO granted SMC based on aid and attendance, effective from April 10, 2021 and SMC under 38 U.S.C. 1114, subsection (p) and 38 CFR 3.350(f)(3) at the rate intermediate between subsection (l) and subsection (m) on account of entitlement to the rate equal to subsection (l) with additional disability of generalized anxiety disorder independently ratable at 50 percent or more, effective from June 14, 2022.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Board Hearing docket.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran sent an email on October 2, 2024 asking to please remove this appeal per his visit at the Manila VARO in March 2004 and stating that all of his claims need to be closed as soon as possible.  He also called a VA Regional Office on October 2, 2024 requesting that his BVA appeal docket number 230106-312680 for entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114, subsection (p) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(3) at the rate intermediate between subsection (l) and (m) be withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
