ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinnitus onset during his active military service.

2. The Veteran's back and neck disability is attributed to his lengthy military career and physical wear and tear of service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for a back disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

3. The criteria for service connection for a neck disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1988 to May1992, March 2003 to January 2004, June 2010 to March 2011, August 2015 to September 2015, February 2018 to November 2018, and from January 2021 to March 2022, with additional Reserve service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

The Board notes that the Veteran's NOD is untimely.  However, an extension of the period for filing a VA Form 10182 may be granted for good cause.  Whether good cause has been shown will be determined by the Board.  The Veteran was denied service connection for these claims in September 2022.  In March 2023, he attempted to file a new claim for these issues but was notified he must submit the claim on the correct form.  He again attempted to file a new claim for these issues in September 2023 but was again notified he must submit the claim on the correct form.  He then filed the above October 2023 NOD wherein he stated he was out of town for his examinations and his attorney at the time did not relay this information to the RO.  The record reflects that the Veteran attempted to continuously pursue this claim.  Based on a review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran has identified good cause for an extension of time to submit his VA Form 10182.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203, 21.1033(e). 

Under the law, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Tinnitus is a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking.  YT v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 195, 196 (1996).  Tinnitus is the type of disability that is capable of lay observation.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  

In this case, the Veteran contends that he suffered from tinnitus due to gunfire and loud noise in service.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, June 2022.  The Board has no reason to doubt the Veteran's reports of experiencing tinnitus during service and presently and finds these statements credible.  

As tinnitus, a chronic disease, was present during service and is present currently, and is not clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause, service connection is granted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).    

2. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability

3. Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability

The Veteran contends that he suffers from a back and neck disability as a result of wear and tear from service.  See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), June 2022. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Generally, to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Pain that causes functional impairment can be considered a disability.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Service treatment records document Cervicalgia in May 2018, low back and neck pain from wearing gear in October 2018, back pain in February 2019, back and neck pain in January 2021, and back pain in September 2021.  See STR-Reserves March 2020, STR March 2022, STR February 2024. 

The Veteran has continuously reported that he suffers from back and neck pain due to wear and tear from his service.  The Veteran is competent to report such experiences and observations because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes through one's senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  As a result, the Board finds the element of an in-service occurrence has been met in this case.

The Board finds the Veteran's testimony credible regarding the wear and tear from service, especially considering his lengthy 30-year active duty and reserve military career.   There is no adequate medical opinion contrary to a conclusion that the back and neck had its onset in service.  Thus, the evidence is at least approximately balanced as to whether these disabilities had their onset in service.

As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for a back and neck disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  See also Buchanan, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[N]othing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself.")
