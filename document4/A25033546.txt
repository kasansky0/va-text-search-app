An initial compensable rating for left little toe hammer toe is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) severed service connection for right and left little toes hammer toes effective July 29, 2022. 

2. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations prevent the award of a retroactive increase or additional benefit after basic entitlement to service connection has been terminated.

3. The award of increased ratings for right and left little toes hammer toes would constitute retroactive increases. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for right little toe hammer toe have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). 

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for left little toe hammer toe have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2010 to July 2022.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in September 2023 by a VA Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In August 2024, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).   

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board observes that, in his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also attempted to appeal an April 2024 rating decision that proposed to severe service connection for right and left little toe hammer toes. However, as such was only a proposal and not a final decision on the matter, it is not appealable. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104; 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Consequently, such will not be addressed herein. Nonetheless, the record reflects that an August 2024 rating decision effectuated the proposed severance. Thus, the Veteran is advised that he has one year from the issuance of such decision to file a decision review request. 

Finally, the Board notes that, in his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran reported that he was seeking service connection for fused bones in his toes rather than hammer toes. Thus, he is advised that he may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right little toe hammer toe.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left little toe hammer toe.

The September 2023 rating decision on appeal awarded service connection for right and left little toes hammer toes with noncompensable ratings as of July 29, 2022, and September 28, 2023, respectively.  However, service connection for such disabilities were severed as of July 29, 2022, in an August 2024 rating decision.  Prior to the severance of service connection, the Veteran appealed the propriety of the initially assigned noncompensable ratings for such disabilities.  However, VA regulations state that a retroactive increase or additional benefit will not be awarded after basic entitlement has been terminated, such as by severance of service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  In this regard, an award of higher initial ratings for right and left little toes hammer toes would result in additional benefits.  As the Veteran is no longer in receipt of VA disability benefits for his bilateral hammer toes, the Board finds the law is dispositive in this case and his appeal for higher initial ratings must be denied.
