ORDER

A higher rate of VA death (survivor's) pension benefits is denied.

Special monthly pension based on the need for the regular aid and attendance of another person or housebound status (SMP-AA/HB) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant's countable income was correctly calculated, and she received appropriate rate of survivor's pension benefits.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the appellant was blind, a patient in a nursing home, or had a factual need for the regular aid and attendance of another person, or that she was housebound due to her medical conditions.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a higher rate of survivor's pension benefits have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23, 3.271, 3.272, 3.273.

2. The criteria for SMP-AA/HB have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1122, 1502, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.351, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1952 to January 1954. He died in May 2014, and the appellant is his surviving spouse.

The decision on appeal was issued January 16, 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 16, 2024, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Lastly, the Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to fully and sympathetically develop a appellant's claim to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004). As the appellant is pro se, the Board has liberally construed her Notice of Disagreement as the matters addressed below.

Pension Rates

Basic entitlement to pension exists if, among other things, the claimant's income is not in excess of the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.23. 38 U.S.C. § 1521; 38 C.F.R. § 3.3(a)(3). The MAPR is revised every December 1st and is applicable for the following 12-month period. The MAPR shall be reduced by the amount of the countable annual income of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23(b).

In determining annual income, all payments of any kind or from any source (including salary, retirement or annuity payments, one-time lump sum payments or similar income, even if waived) shall be included during the 12-month annualization period in which received, except for income specifically excluded. 38 U.S.C. § 1503(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.271(a), 3.272. Income from the SSA is not specifically excluded under 38 C.F.R. § 3.272. Such income is therefore included as countable income.

For purposes of calculating countable income, total income may be reduced by amounts paid by a claimant for unreimbursed medical expenses that are "in excess of 5 percent of the applicable maximum annual pension rate or rates... as in effect during the 12-month annualization period in which the medical expenses were paid." 38 C.F.R. § 3.272(g)(1)(iii). In order to be excluded from income, these medical expenses must be paid during the time period at issue, regardless of when they were incurred. Medical insurance premiums themselves, including Medicare Plan B premiums deducted from Social Security benefits, may be applied to reduce countable income.

1. Entitlement to a higher rate of survivor's pension benefits.

A December 2014 decision granted the appellant's claim of entitlement to survivor's pension benefits. A December 2014 VA letter notified the appellant that her survivor's pension benefits were granted starting on June 1, 2014, the first day of the first month after the Veteran's death in May 2014. Notification Letter (December 2014). Thereafter, the appellant's monthly survivor's pension benefits received a cost-of-living adjustment. See Notification Letter (December 2016, December 2017, December 2018, December 2019, December 2020, December 2021, December 2022). 

In May 2023, the appellant submitted a VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance. See VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance (May 2023). A January 2024 decision denied entitlement to higher rate of survivor's pension benefits. See Notification Letter (January 2024). 

This appeal arises from the appellant's disagreement with the rate of survivor's pension benefits. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024) (stating that she incurred caregiver expenses, suggesting that she seeks a higher rate of survivor's pension benefits). The appeal period for consideration in this case is from May 9, 2023, when the appellant submitted her VA 21-2680, until the decision on appeal, January 17, 2024. 

The Board concludes that a higher rate of payment of survivor's pension benefits is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1521; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.23, 3.155, 3.271, 3.272, 3.273. 

Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that the rate of survivor's pension benefits was proper. From May 2023 to January 2024, the appellant's survivor's pension benefits were properly calculated to reflect her income from Social Security Administration (SSA). 

For the period effective December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, the MAPR for a surviving spouse with no dependents was of $10,757. See Past Rates: 2023 VA Survivors Pension Benefit Rates | Veterans Affairs (accessed March 13, 2025). For the period effective December 1, 2023, to November 30, 2024, the MAPR for a surviving spouse with no dependents was of $11,102. See Past Rates: 2024 VA Survivors Pension Benefit Rates | Veterans Affairs (accessed March 13, 2025).

As pertinent to the appellant's appeal, from May 2023 until November 2023, the appellant's total family income was properly calculated as $8,590. See SSA Profile and Benefit Data (August 2023); COLA - Adjusted (C710) (December 2022). Her income included only annual SSA benefits in the amount of $8,570 ($715.90 per month). From December 2023, until January 2024, the appellant's total family income was properly calculated as $8,844. See SSA Profile and Benefit Data (August 2023); COLA - Adjusted (C710) (December 2023). Her income included only annual SSA benefits in the amount of $8,844 ($738 per month).

In terms of unreimbursed medical expenses, while the appellant reported "caregiver expenses," she did not list any expenses, provided no specific amounts of expenses, or who incurred the expenses and who was paid as her caregiver. In September 2023, she reported that she had no additional evidence to submit, stating that all the records were at San Juan VA medical center, which were the Veteran's records. See 5103 Notice Acknowledgment (September 2023). From May 2023 until November 2023, SSA inquiry reflects a monthly Medicare premium payment in the amount of $44.90, annualized as $538.80. From December 2023 until January 2024, SSA inquiry reflects a monthly Medicare premium payment in the amount of $54.79, annualized as $656.40. Five percent of the applicable MAPR from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023, is $537. Five percent of the applicable MAPR from December 1, 2023, is $555. Given that only medical expenses in excess of five percent of the applicable MAPR may be deducted, for the period from May 9, 2023, to November 30, 2023, only $1.80 may be deducted; and for the period from December 1, 2023, to January 17, 2024, the appellant's unreimbursed medical expenses of $101 may be deducted.

Therefore, from May 9, 2023, until November 30, 2023, the appellant's countable income was $8,568.20. Subtracting her countable income from the MAPR equals to a monthly pension rate of $182. From December 1, 2023, until January 17, 2024, subtracting that income of $8,743 from the applicable MAPR of $11,102 and dividing it by 12 totals in a monthly survivor's pension benefit amount of $180 which is lower than $188 that the AOJ awarded the appellant. As such, a higher survivor's pension rate is not warranted for this period.

The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's financial situation. However, VA pension is a needs-based benefit and all payments of any kind, to include Social Security benefits, are included as countable income to calculate the amount of benefits to be awarded. Moreover, the Board is without authority to grant benefits on any other basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994); see also Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992).

Accordingly, the claim is denied.

SMP-AA/HB: Laws and Regulations

Special monthly pension is payable to individuals who are permanently bedridden or helpless or so nearly helpless as to be in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person under the criteria set forth in 38C.F.R. §3.352(a). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1502(b), 1521; 38C.F.R. §3.351(a), (b).

To establish a need for regular aid and attendance, a claimant must (1) be blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; (2) be a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or (3) show a factual need for aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1502(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(c).

The following factors will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance: inability of a claimant to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustments of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of a claimant to feed himself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, either physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). Performance of the necessary aid and attendance service by a relative of the beneficiary or other member of his household will not prevent the granting of the additional allowance. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(c).

Eligibility for special monthly pension by reason of regular need for aid and attendance requires that at least one of the factors set forth in VA regulation is met. See Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996). In addition, determinations that the claimant is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. Id. In adjudicating claims for special monthly pension, VA must consider all of the enumerated factors listed in the regulation and, if at least one of the factors is present, special monthly pension should be awarded. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448 (2000) (citing Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222 (1996)).

A surviving spouse that does not meet the requirements for increased pension based on need for aid and attendance, will nonetheless be awarded a higher rate of death pension if they are permanently housebound by reason of disability. The "permanently housebound" requirement is met when the surviving spouse is substantially confined to his or her home (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises by reason of disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout the surviving spouse's lifetime. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(f).

2. Entitlement to SMP-AA/HB.

The appellant seeks SMP-AA/HB, stating that she had a breast cancer operation in March 2022 with continued treatment, and has diabetes, hypertension, asthma, thyroid issues and depression. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024).

The Board concludes that the criteria for a higher rate of pension based on the appellant's need for the regular aid and attendance of another person or by reason of being housebound are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1502(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(c).

Initially, there is no evidence of record showing that the appellant was blind, or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less, in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less, that she was bedridden, or a patient in a nursing home. Additionally, the record does not indicate that she is housebound.

Turning to the evidence, the appellant submitted a May 2023 VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance completed by a private physician. See VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance (May 2023). VA 21-2680 reflects diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, type II, and bronchial asthma. The physician provided that she was able to leave her home or immediate premises, and that she did not require the use of a cane, any brace, crutches, or the assistance of another person for locomotion; thereby indicating that she had no restrictions. In terms of nutrition, she was characterized as overweight with a body mass index of 29.61.  Her gait and posture were adequate. She had no restrictions of either upper extremity or of her spine, trunk and neck. In terms of her lower extremities, walking long distances was restricted due to paresthesias and pain in her knees. Otherwise, she had no other pathology that affected her ability to perform self-care, ambulate or travel beyond her home. The physician noted that the appellant was able to feed herself and prepare her own meals; did not require assistance in bathing and tending to other hygiene needs and was not legally blind; and did not require nursing home care. She required medication management due to uncontrolled diabetes. The physician assessed that she had the mental capacity to manage her benefit payments, or to direct someone to do so. It was noted that she was able to leave her home daily, and that she did not require the use of a cane, any brace, crutches, or the assistance of another person for locomotion.

First, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not support a finding that the appellant needed the aid and attendance of another person at any point during the pertinent pendency of her claim. She did not have blindness and she was not a patient in a nursing home. Additionally, the appellant clearly did not have any restrictions with her upper extremities, back, trunk, or spine, and she did not have mental incapacity, in spite of diagnoses including diabetes and bronchial asthma. Her only restriction was walking long distances restricted due to paresthesias and pain in her knees. The evidence of record does not indicate that the appellant was unable to dress herself or to keep herself ordinarily clean and presentable; that she needed assistance with frequent adjustment of a special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, that she was unable to feed herself, that she was unable to attend to the wants of nature, or that she had physical incapacity that required care and assistance on a regular basis to protect her from the hazards or dangers incident to her daily environment. Thus, the appellant was not shown to need the regular aid and attendance of another person on a factual basis, as contemplated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

Second, the evidence does not support a finding that she was housebound. The physician that provided the May 2023 private VA 21-2680 indicated that the appellant did not have any restrictions with leaving her home or immediate premises.

Therefore, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the appellant is in need of regular aid and attendance of another person to keep herself ordinarily clean, to attend to the wants of nature, and to protect herself from hazards or dangers incident to her daily environment, or that she had any restrictions with leaving her home or immediate premises.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's health problems and their attendant difficulties. However,  the Board is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994); see also Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992). The appellant is reminded that if she experiences any change in her physical condition she may file a supplemental claim.
