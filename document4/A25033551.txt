ORDER

The May 22, 2024, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on April 29, 2023, that denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the April 29, 2023 rating decision issued on May 2, 2023, that denied service connection for service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The May 22, 2024, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the April 29, 2023 rating decision issued on May 2, 2023, that denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(b), 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1955 to March 1959. The Veteran filed a May 22, 2024, Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the April 29, 2023 rating decision and selecting the Evidence Submission docket. 

TIMELINESS OF AN APPEAL

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Timeliness of the May 22, 2024, Board Appeal request with respect to the April 29, 2023 rating decision.

On May 22, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the April 29, 2023 rating decision issued on May 2, 2023, that denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on April 29, 2023. 

As noted above, the rating decision issued on April 29, 2023 denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia. The Veteran and the Veteran's representative were notified of the decision in a May 2, 2023, letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and his representative at the time, Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs, and was not returned as undeliverable.

The Veteran's May 22, 2024, Board appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the May 2, 2023, letter that notified the Veteran of the April 29, 2023, rating decision that denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia. 

Although the Veteran has generally asserted that good cause exists for an extension to file an appeal, neither the Veteran nor his representative has provided an explanation for the delay in filing an appeal. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the May 22, 2024 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the April 23, 2023 rating decision issued on May 2, 2023, that denied service connection for right lower lobe lung cancer with metastasis and right lower lobe thrombocytopenia, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
