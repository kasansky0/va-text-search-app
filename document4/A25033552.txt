REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Army from September 1986 to September 1989.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 higher-level review decision, following a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran elected the Board's Evidence Submission docket. See October 2024 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision and any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the October 2024 VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.303.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file during a period that is outside the applicable evidentiary window - between the July 2024 rating decision and the October 2024 VA Form 10182, and more than 90 days following the VA Form 10182. However, as the Veteran's claim is being remanded, the AOJ will consider the claim in light of the entire claims file upon remand.

The Board notes that under the modernized system, appellees generally have a year to request to change dockets. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Here, the Veteran selected the Evidence Submission docket, but he did not submit evidence in support of his appeal within 90 days following the VA Form 10182 and did not submit a Williams waiver. See 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.202(c)(2). However, as the Veteran's motion that this appeal be advanced on the docket due to financial hardship and homelessness has been granted, and the claim is being remanded to rectify an AOJ duty-to-assist error, the Board is obligated to address his claim in a timely manner and finds no prejudice to the Veteran in expediently remanding the claim in the absence of a Williams waiver. 

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric disability is due to service. See November 2021 VA Mental Health Disorders Examination. 

In the November 2021 VA mental health disorders examination, as well as in August 2009 VA treatment records, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding private treatment records for prior mental health treatment. Notably, in the March 2023 VA Form 20-0999, upon higher-level review, it was found that a duty-to-assist error occurred, and the claim was returned to obtain verification of stressors, as well as outstanding identified private mental health treatment records from the Veteran. However, upon review of the claims file, although the AOJ requested verification of the identified stressors, the AOJ did not request authorization to obtain the identified private treatment records from the Veteran. 

As these records were identified prior to the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, fulfillment of the statutory duty to assist requires reasonable efforts are made to obtain outstanding private treatment records. As no such efforts were made prior to the July 2024 rating decision, the AOJ committed a duty-to-assist error prior to the rating decision on appeal. Accordingly, remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.

The Board reminds the Veteran that the "duty to assist is not always a one-way street." A veteran is expected to cooperate in the efforts to adjudicate the claim, and his failure to do so would subject him to the risk of an adverse adjudication based on an incomplete and underdeveloped record. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for the identified private mental health treatment noted in the August 2009 VA treatment records and the November 2021 VA Mental Health Disorders Examination. Make two requests for the authorized records from the identified physicians and/or facilities, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
