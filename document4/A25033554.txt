FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to June 1, 2023, the service-connected benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals have been shown to be manifested by no more than voiding dysfunction with urine leakage which required absorbent material be changed two to four times per day; daytime voiding interval between two to three hours; and nighttime awakening to void.  

2. On and after June 1, 2023, the service-connected benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals has been shown to be manifested by no more than voiding dysfunction with urine leakage which requires absorbent material be changed more than four times per day; daytime voiding interval less than one-hour; nighttime awakening to void two times; and obstructive voiding with hesitancy and weak stream.  

3. The Veteran's May 2011 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21 526EZ, seeking service connection for a bladder disability was received by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction on May 17, 2011. 

4. In May 2014, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for a bladder disability. 

5. New and material evidence as to the issue of service connection for a bladder disability was received within one year of notice of the May 2014 rating decision and the rating decision did not become final.

6. In August 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction increased the rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals from noncompensable to 60 percent, effective June 1, 2023. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 

1. The criteria for a rating of 40 percent, and no higher, prior to June 1, 2023, for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7529.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 60 percent on and after June 1, 2023, for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7529.

3. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 1, 2023, for the award of a 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Veteran had active service from October 1960 to January 1970. 

In January 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction increased the rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals from noncompensable to 60 percent; granted both a TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependent's Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35; and effectuated the awards as of June 1, 2023.  In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket.  On June 24, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the June 2024 withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

Rating for Benign Bladder Papilloma and Laser Ureterolithiasis Residuals

Disability ratings are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms during the relevant period with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Benign neoplasms of the genitourinary system, including benign bladder papilloma, are to be rated as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7529.

Diseases of the genitourinary system generally result in disabilities related to renal or voiding dysfunction, infections, or a combination of these symptomatologies.  Where the applicable diagnostic codes refer the decision-maker to these specific areas of dysfunction, only the predominant area of dysfunction shall be considered for rating purposes.  Since the areas of dysfunction described below do not cover all symptoms resulting from genitourinary diseases, specific diagnoses may include a description of symptoms assigned to that diagnosis. 

Voiding dysfunction is evaluated as either urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding.  Continual urine leakage, post-surgical urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, or stress incontinence requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than two times per day warrants a 20 percent rating.  A 40 percent rating requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed two to four times per day.  A 60 percent rating requires the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than four times per day.

Urinary frequency manifested by daytime voiding at intervals of between two and three hours or awakening to void twice per night warrants a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating requires daytime voiding at intervals of between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night.  A 40 percent rating requires daytime voiding at intervals of less than one hour or awakening to void five or more times per night.

Obstructed voiding manifested by obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilatation one to two times per year warrants a noncompensable rating.  A 10 percent rating requires marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, and decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post void residuals greater than 150 cc; (2) uroflowmetric findings of markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc/sec); (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; and (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every two to three months.  A 30 percent rating requires urinary retention necessitating intermittent or continuous catheterization.

Renal dysfunction with GFR (glomerular filtration rate) from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/173 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than or equal to 30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months, warrants a noncompensable rating.  A 30 percent rating requires chronic kidney disease with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  A 60 percent rating requires chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  An 80 percent rating requires chronic kidney disease with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  A 100 percent rating requires chronic kidney disease with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient warrants a 100 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

Period prior to June 1, 2023

The Veteran asserts that a compensable rating on and prior to June 1, 2023, for the service-connected bladder disability is warranted.

An April 2014 VA treatment record states that the Veteran had bladder incontinence. 

The report of a March 2017 urinary examination conducted for VA states that the Veteran complained of blood in his urine.  He was diagnosed with benign bladder papilloma.  The examiner noted the Veteran had a history of urethral calculi removed through a laser procedure.  On examination, the Veteran was noted o have a history of a benign neoplasm and no associated voiding dysfunction, urinary leakage, voiding obstruction, or renal dysfunction. 

At the April 2021 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that: he urinated "every hour" interrupting his sleep and with medication he was "still getting up three to five times a night; voiding every two or three hours during the daytime; and used absorbent materials which he changed several times a day. The Veteran clarified that he changed his absorbent materials three to four times per day.

At a July 2022 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that: he urinated "every twenty minutes" during night; "he could extend it out to two hours" with medication; and uses absorbent materials which he changes two to three times day.

Prior to June 1, 2023, the service-connected benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals have been shown to be manifested by no more than voiding dysfunction with urine leakage which required absorbent material be changed two to four times per day; daytime voiding interval between two to three hours; and nighttime awakening to void.  Such findings merits assignment of at least a 40 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7529.  In the absence of the need for an appliance or voiding dysfunction requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than four times per day, the Board concludes that a 40 percent rating, and no higher, on and prior to June 1, 2023, for benign bladder papilloma is warranted. 

On and after June 1, 2023

The Veteran argues that a rating in excess of 60 percent for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals on and after June 1, 2023, is warranted.

The report of a June 1, 2023 VA urological examination states that the Veteran had a history of urethral calculi which were  removed with an invasive or non invasive procedure two times or less per year.  The Veteran reported experiencing voiding dysfunction with urine leakage which required absorbent material to be changed more than four times per day; daytime voiding intervals of less than one hour; nighttime awakening to void twice a night; obstructive voiding with hesitancy and weak stream; and no renal dysfunction.  The report of a June 1, 2023, VA genitourinary examination conducted by the same examiner states that the Veteran was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction and benign bladder papilloma.  The Veteran reported experiencing voiding dysfunction with urinary leakage which required that absorbent material be changed more than four times per day; daytime voiding intervals of less than an hour; nighttime awakening to void twice a night; obstructive voiding with hesitancy and a weak stream; and renal dysfunction. While the examiner checked the box on the examination for renal dysfunction, the VA examination does not establish that the benign bladder papillomas were productive of renal dysfunction. 

A June 2024 VA evaluation states that the examiner had reviewed the Veteran's records.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with benign bladder papilloma.  The examiner commented that the voiding dysfunction was due to the service-connected disability.  The Veteran's voiding dysfunction required changing absorbent material more than four times a day and daytime voiding in intervals less than one hour, with hesitant and weak strain of urination. The Veteran also reported experiencing increased urination frequency with urination every 20 minutes. 

On and after June 1, 2023, the service-connected benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals has been shown to be manifested by no more than voiding dysfunction with urine leakage which requires absorbent material be changed more than four times per day; daytime voiding interval less than one-hour; nighttime awakening to void two times; and obstructive voiding with hesitancy and weak stream.  Such findings merit the assignment of a 60 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7529.  That is the maximum schedular rating for voiding dysfunction. 

The record does not establish, and the Veteran does not allege, that the service connected benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals are productive of renal dysfunction.  While the June 1, 2023, VA examiner incorrectly endorsed the service-connected benign bladder papilloma was productive of renal dysfunction.  Therefore, he is not eligible for a higher rating based on renal dysfunction.  According, a rating in excess of 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma on and after June 1, 2023, is denied.

Earlier Effective Date

The effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  Specific to claims for increased disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if a claim is received by VA within one year after that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The Veteran asserts that an effective date prior to June 1, 2023, for the award of a 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals is warranted.  He advances no specific contentions in support of his appeal. 

The Veteran's May 2011 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21 526EZ, seeking service connection for a bladder disability was received by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction on May 17, 2011. 

In May 2013, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for a bladder disability.  A June 2013 notification letter to the Veteran advised him of the April 2013 rating decision.  The letter stated that: "this is a provisional decision that is based on the evidence currently in VA's possession;" "[i]f you have additional relevant evidence pertaining to the issues decided here that you would like us to consider, please submit it to our office within one year of the date of this letter and we may reconsider our decision;" and "if you want to receive a final decision with appeal rights before the one-year provisional period ends, send VA a signed statement as follows: All necessary evidence was considered by VA. I request that this provisional decision be made final."

In his July 2013 Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 21-0958, the Veteran conveyed that "I would like this form to serve as my official notice of disagreement to VA Rating Decision dated June 6, 2013" and "I would like to appeal service connection for bladder cancer." 

An April 2014 notification letter to the Veteran states that "we have received you notice of disagreement based on the provisional rating decision in which we sent a notification on June 6, 2013" and "this was not a final decision and did not include appeal rights."  The May 2013 rating decision is provisional, and not final.

In May 2014, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for s bladder disability. 

A September 2014 treatment record by J. Kim M.D., states that the Veteran was diagnosed with bladder cancer. 

The September 2014 treatment record from Dr. Kim, documenting a diagnosis of bladder cancer, was received into the record within one year following notice of the May 2014 rating decision.  It is of such significance that it raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim of entitlement to service connection for a bladder disability when considered with the evidence previously of record.  Therefore, the Board finds that the May 2014 rating decision denying service connection for bladder cancer did not become final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

In July 2017, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a statement of the case to the Veteran.  In August 2017, the Veteran submitted an Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeal, VA Form 9. 

In September 2019, the Board granted service connection for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals. 

In May 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction established service connection for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals, rated as noncompensable, effective May 17, 2011. 

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket seeking a compensable rating for benign bladder papilloma. 

In August 2021, the Board remanded entitlement to an initial compensable rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals. 

In January 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied a compensable rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals. 

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket seeking a compensable rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals. 

In January 2023, the Board remanded entitlement to an initial compensable rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals. 

In August 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction increased the rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals from noncompensable to 60 percent, effective June 1, 2023, the date of the VA examination.

The Veteran submitted a May 2011 VA Form 21 526EZ, seeking service connection for a bladder disability which he continuously pursued until the award of the 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma.  As discussed above in regard to the rating for the service-connected benign bladder papilloma, the disability was initially found to meet the criteria for a 60 percent rating at the June 1, 2023, VA examination. Therefore, the appropriate effective date for the award of a 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals is June 1, 2023, the date it was initially factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred.  Accordingly, the Board finds an effective date prior to June 1, 2023, for a 60 percent rating for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to effective dates prior to June 1, 2023, for the awards of a TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is remanded. 

Considering the award of a 40 percent rating prior to June 1, 2023, for benign bladder papilloma and laser ureterolithiasis residuals, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction should readjudicate the issues of effective dates prior to June 1, 2023, for the awards of TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Readjudicate the issue of an effective date prior to 

 

June 1, 2023, for the award of TDIU and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.
