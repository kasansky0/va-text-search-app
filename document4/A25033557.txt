FINDING OF FACT

On April 1, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant through his representative that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the October 31, 2024, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) as to the appeal for an increased disability rating for the service-connected prostate cancer with urinary frequency and incontinence, currently rated at 40 percent prior to October 9, 2024, and rated as 60 percent thereafter, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1964 to October 1967.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision, which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the October 2023 rating decision, the RO confirmed and continued the previously assigned 40 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer with urinary frequency and incontinence.

On October 31, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  The Veteran selected the Hearing docket.  A hearing was scheduled for April 1, 2025.  Before the April 2025 hearing, the RO issued a rating in decision in March 2025 that increased the Veteran's prostate cancer disability rating to 60 percent, effective from October 9, 2024.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative, and must include the name of the Veteran, the VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id. 

In April 1, 2025, and prior to the promulgation of this appeal, the Veteran's attorney submitted correspondence indicating that the Veteran wished to cancel his April 2025 Board hearing and withdraw his appeal, noting that the Veteran was satisfied with his current benefits and did not wish to proceed with the claim.  The correspondence included the Veteran's full name, VA File number, and docket number.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
