ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his currently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea was incurred during his active duty service. 

2. The competent and credible evidence shows that the Veteran does not currently have PTSD.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. [The criteria for service connection for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2010 to February 2014.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in January 2024 and June 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision denying service connection for PTSD and a June 2023 rating decision denying service connection for sleep apnea.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR rating decision denying service connection for PTSD, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision.  The AOJ also determined that there had been a duty to assist error with regards to the service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In June 2024, the AOJ denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, in adjudicating the service connection claim for PTSD and at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision in adjudicating the service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

By way of history, the Veteran filed an August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested readjudication of the service connection claim for PTSD most recently addressed in a May 2023 rating decision and service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision.  As noted above, the AOJ denied the service connection claim for PTSD in a January 2024 rating decision and, after finding a duty to assist error in a January 2024 rating decision, denied the service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea in a June 2024 rating decision.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued his service connection claims since April 21, 2022. 

In the January and June 2024 rating decisions, the AOJ made the favorable findings that (1) the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea; (2) he had participated in toxic exposure risk activities based on his service in Kuwait and Afghanistan; (3) his claimed primary condition of chronic adjustment disorder was service connected; (4) service treatment records showed multiple complaints of sleep disturbance due to rumination and pain; and (5) the Veteran's in-service stressor was conceded based on evidence of in-service assault with resultant anxiety and other related symptoms in a January 2012 service treatment record.  These findings are binding on the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  

Pursuant to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), VA has duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Generally, service connection requires: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 - 67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The first requirement for any service connection claim is evidence of a disability.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

Service treatment records show that the Veteran complained of difficulty sleeping due to his mental health condition and right knee pain.  

In an April 2022 claim, the Veteran asserted that his sleep apnea was due to service as he was unable to get proper sleep and was always tired.

In a May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was less likely than not caused by his toxic exposure risk activities.  The examiner found that there was no evidence in current literature to substantiate a direct effect of the Veteran's sleep apnea condition to his chemical exposures.  Obstructive sleep apnea was caused by a physical obstruction due to a small oropharyngeal opening and/or excessive soft tissue blocking airflow resulting in hypopnea and apneic spells.

The examiner also opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was due to his service-connected ADHD/adjustment disorder.  The examiner stated that since these were separate and distinct medical conditions with different and distinct etiologies, one did not cause the other.  Sleep apnea involved upper airway obstruction, usually of the pharynx, and ADHD was a mental health condition that did not caused sleep apnea.  He repeated that obstructive sleep apnea was caused by a physical obstruction.  There was no current medical literature that supports a correlation or direct causative relationship between ADHD and obstructive sleep apnea.  The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was aggravated beyond its natural progression since sleep medication did not cause sleep apnea.  He repeated that obstructed sleep apnea was caused by a physical obstruction.  

In a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.  He reported that it began in 2012 after he returned from overseas.  His wife noticed problems with his sleep.  The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was due to his military service.  Without chronicity during or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury was considered to be a more likely etiology.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had insomnia in 2009 and 2011, but that his 2013 separation examination was silent for a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  Over four years after service, in 2018, the Veteran complained of problems breathing during sleep.  He was diagnosed with sleep apnea after service, therefore there was no nexus.  

In a June 2024 supplemental opinion, the examiner noted that the Veteran was given sleep aid and denied chronic insomnia in 2009.  In 2011, he was assessed with insomnia.  There was no medical literature to support that the in-service sleep disorder, diagnosed as insomnia, to be a causal factor for sleep apnea.  Therefore, there was no nexus. 

Post-service VA treatment records show that the Veteran was suspected to have sleep apnea with referral for a study in May 2014.  In September 2014, he was diagnosed with dyssomnia (high clinical suspicion for obstructive sleep apnea), snoring, and hypersomnia.  He also reported that according to his wife he stopped breathing while sleeping, woke up gagging, snored loudly, and always woke up tired.  In August 2018, he was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea after a sleep study. 

Based on a careful review of the evidence and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is approximately balanced that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was incurred during his active duty service.  Service treatment records show that the Veteran had difficulties sleeping during service and a May 2014 VA treatment record indicates that he had obstructive sleep apnea only two months after separation from service.  Further, September 2014 VA treatment record and February 2024 VA examination corroborates sleep apnea symptoms during service.  

While the Board acknowledges that the May 2023 and February 2024 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was not due to service, the Board finds that these opinions are inadequate as they were not supported by well-reasoned rationales and did not consider the May 2014 VA treatment record indicating that the Veteran may have had obstructive sleep apnea.  As such, the Board finds that these opinions lack probative value.

Accordingly, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance that his obstructive sleep apnea began during his active duty service.  Accordingly, his claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is denied.

Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition; a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).  A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a), which provides that all psychiatric diagnoses must conform to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).

Service treatment records show that the Veteran received mental health treatment and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and ADHD.  They also show that he had been a victim of hazing which resulted in legal action against the perpetrators. 

In an April 2022 lay statement, the Veteran described how he had been sexually and personally assaulted by a sergeant.  

In a May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with anxiety and ADHD.  He was not diagnosed with PTSD.  The examiner opined that, upon review of all records, to include service medical records, military personnel records, lay statements, and post-service treatment records, the Veteran did not currently meet the criteria for PTSD.  

In a June 2023 VA medical opinion, the examiner found that the Veteran should have been service connected for adjustment disorder and not ADHD as the latter was a neurodevelopmental disorder that must originate in childhood.  Further, service treatment records and VA records showed that the Veteran was diagnosed and treated for ADHD starting at a young age.  It was less likely than not that ADHD was aggravated beyond its natural progression by service as it was a neurodevelopment disorder.  

Post-service VA treatment records do not show complaints of, treatment for, or a diagnosis of PTSD.  

The Veteran is currently service connected for chronic adjustment disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9440.

Based on a careful review of all of the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding service connection for PTSD is warranted.

In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran and his representative have not presented any competent evidence that the Veteran has PTSD.  There is no evidence of any complaints of, treatment for, or diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.  In fact, the May 2023 VA examiner expressly found that the Veteran did not have PTSD.  

In sum, the Veteran has not presented, identified, or alluded to the existence of any post-service medical evidence of PTSD.  Here, no underlying disability has been clinically diagnosed during the appeal period or proximate thereto.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The Veteran is certainly competent to report his history of mental health problems and any treatment that he may have undergone.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  However, the Veteran has not demonstrated that he has the requisite specialized knowledge to diagnose PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran has not presented any competent and credible evidence of a current diagnosis for PTSD, and the available evidence does not support that the Veteran had any persistent symptomatology that would suggest that he had an underlying chronic disability.  Accordingly, the Veteran's assertions that he has a current diagnosis for PTSD have little probative value.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection for PTSD is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding in favor of the Veteran's service connection claim.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), is therefore not for application as to this claim.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
