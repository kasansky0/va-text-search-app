ORDER

Service connection for a headache disability on a direct basis only is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a headache disability as secondary to service-connected disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's current headache disability was shown as chronic in service or manifested to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; or was noted in service with continuity of symptoms since service; or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a headache disability on a direct basis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to February 1981 and with additional Reserve service. 

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 30, 2022, rating decision denying service connection for right knee disability and review of a February 14, 2023, rating decision denying service connection for headache disability.  Additionally, in a March 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, the Veteran requested review of a July 29, 2022 rating decision denial of initial higher rating for PTSD. On May 11, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 29, 2022, November 30, 2022, and February 14, 2023 decisions, respectively.  

In a February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 29, 2022, November 30, 2022, and February 14, 2023, rating decisions, respectively, which was subsequently subject to the HLR decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Since the claim for service connection for a headache disability on a secondary basis require additional development, whereas the claims for service connection for that matter on a direct basis do not, the Board finds that it is appropriate to bifurcate the issues and adjudicate them separately. See Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311, 315 (2011) ("bifurcation of a claim is generally within the Secretary's discretion"); see also Tyrues v. Shinseki, 732 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Roebuck v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 307, 315 (2006) (acknowledging that the Board can bifurcate a claim and address different theories or arguments in separate decisions).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d).

Certain chronic diseases, such as other organic diseases of the nervous system (e.g. migraine headaches), will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Entitlement to service connection for a headache disability. 

The Veteran contends his current headache disability had an onset during service noting that he had "constant throbbing like a base drum" in service that has persisted since service reoccurring twice a week. See C&P Exam (January 2022). He also asserts his headaches are a result of in-service noise exposure (gun range and gunman boat duties). See VA 21-526EZ (November 2021). 

The Board concludes that the persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's current headache disability had its onset during active-duty service; manifested to a compensable degree within the initial post separation year; was noted in service with continuity of symptoms since service; or is otherwise etiologically related to an injury or disease incurred during active-duty service. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) show in February 1978, he presented with complaints of a headache for a day along with other upper respiratory symptoms and was assessed with rhinitis, and in October 1980, he complained of headaches along with upper respiratory symptoms and was assessed with a viral syndrome. See STR-Medical (December 2021). Subsequent STRs do not show complaints or treatment for headaches nor diagnosis of a headache disability. Indeed, his February 1981 report of medical examination (RME) at separation shows he received normal evaluations of his head and neurologic system, and the associated report of medical history (RMH) shows he specifically denied having or having had history of "frequent or severe headaches," and, when asked to identify having "ever had any illness or injury other than those already noted," he marked "no" other condition - there is no indication of headache problems or disability reported by the Veteran or noted by the examining physician. See Military Personnel Record (December 2021); STR-Medical (December 2021). 

The first documented evidence of headache disability comes in November 2021 when VA received the Veteran's original VA compensation claim, which included headaches and a reported onset in 1979. See VA 21-526 (November 2021). Prior to this, however, available private treatment records starting in August 2021 do not show history or complaints of headaches. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (November 2021) (noting the Veteran's review of systems was negative except for arthralgia and joint swelling). VA treatment records show the Veteran presented to establish VA care in March 2022 and reported history of osteoarthritis and insomnia with complaints of knee problems and sleep impairment, and a review of systems indicates he denied headaches. See CAPRI (Apri 2022) (positive review of systems noted in patient's history). 

April 2022 VA treatment records show the Veteran first sought treatment for headaches, and specifically, a VA neurology consult notes the Veteran reported a recent onset of recurrent headaches in past couple months manifested by pounding pain and pressure that wakes him up from his sleep and sometimes occurs during the middle of day; he takes ibuprofen for knee pain which helps with his headaches; and assessment was headaches identified as "new onset migraine however new onset at 65 is concerning for secondary underlying structural cause" and notes poor sleep in context of knee pain is triggering factor. See CAPRI (April 2022) (April 25, 2022 view note in "Neurology Clinic Note"); see also VAMC Other Output / Reports (December 2024) (full view of April 25, 2022, VA neurology consult note). Subsequent medical records show diagnoses of tension headaches and migraine. See C&P Exam (January 2022); CAPRI (April 2022); Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided (August 2022). Lastly, during his January 2022 VA headache disability examination, the Veteran's reported a medical history with onset of headaches in 1979 or 1980 when ringing in his ears started has persisted since service recurring about twice a week and treated with Tylenol and ibuprofen. See C&P Exam (January 2022). 

While the record shows that the Veteran has a current headache disability, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it had an onset during service or manifested to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; or that symptoms were noted in service with continuity of symptoms since service; or that the disability is otherwise etiologically related to in-service injury or disease.

Here, the compete lay and medical evidence does not show a headache disability was diagnosed during active service or manifested to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. In this regard, although STRs reflect reports of headache symptomatology in 1978 and 1980, his headaches and other symptomatology were associated with respiratory disorders at each of those times. Indeed, STRs show no documented findings or treatment for headache problems during active duty, much less the Veteran experienced headaches of a nature that persists for a long time or constantly recurs to demonstrate a chronic disability. Further, on his February 1981 RMH at separation, he explicitly denied having had or having a history of frequent or severe headaches, which weighs against a finding that he had onset of a chronic headache disorder during his active duty. There is also not competent, credible evidence of any chronic headache disorder within one year after the Veteran's service separation. The first documented complaints of a chronic headache disability are not shown until November 2021, which comes four decades after his separation from service. Therefore, the most persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran had onset of a chronic headache disability in service or one that manifested to a compensable degree within the initial post separation year.

Moreover, the Veteran's statements that his current headache disability had an onset during service and has continued to present is less than credible as it is inconsistent with the other evidence of record, including his prior reported history. See Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999) (although the Board must take into consideration a claimant's statements, it may consider whether self-interest may be a factor in making such statements); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995) (noting that the credibility of a witness may be impeached by a showing of interest, bias, inconsistent statements, consistency with other evidence), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (explaining that, although the Board "cannot ignore appellant's testimony simply because appellant is an interested party," it may take pecuniary interest into account when assessing the appellant's credibility). Foremost, the Veteran's reports that he has experienced recurring headaches twice a week since service is not borne out by the record as his February 1981 RMH at separation shows he specifically denied having had or having a history of frequent or severe headaches and his head and neurologic system were evaluated as normal and the examiner marked no concerns about headache problems at separation. Additionally, the Veteran did not provide a history of headaches in August 2021 when seeking private treatment for his left knee nor in March 2022 when he established VA care; and in April 2022, he reported medical history of a recent onset of his current headache problems. Hence, to the extent that he now reports persistent headache symptoms since service, this is not borne out by a review of the record to include his medical history that he provided to those providing him with medical care. The Board finds that the more persuasive lay and medical evidence weighs against finding continuity of headache symptoms since service separation. See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511. 

Further, persuasive evidence has not been presented linking the Veteran's current headache disability to an in-service injury or disease, including his in-service headache complaints. Indeed, the January 2022 VA Medical Opinion concludes that the Veteran's tension headaches are less likely than not incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event or illness. In support of that conclusion, the rationale indicates that the Veteran's STRs do not show any finding or diagnosis of a chronic headache disorder associated with his in-service complaints nor was a chronic headache disorder noted at his separation from service. See C&P Exam (January 2022). The VA-obtained opinion provided a supporting explanation noting the Veteran's denial of headache complaints at separation, and at that time, the record did not reflect any treatment for headaches to support a link to service. See C&P Exam (January 2022). Although generally, a VA examiner must consider a veteran's testimony when formulating his or her opinion, see McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016), this is not the case where the Board has found that the lay evidence of record lacks credibility. See e.g., Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (noting that an opinion is inadequate where examiner relies solely on absence of in-service treatment but ignores credible lay evidence). Thus, the Board assigns probative value to the VA-obtained opinions as they are supported by the relevant evidence of record and contains a supporting explanation. See Prejean v. West, 13 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (holding that factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion).

Additionally, the April 2022 VA neurology consult report found that the Veteran's migraines was a recent onset that was likely secondary to an underlying structural cause, and further, suggested poor sleep in context of knee pain as triggering factor for migraines. See CAPRI (April 2022) (April 25, 2022 view note in "Neurology Clinic Note"); see also VAMC Other Output / Reports (December 2024) (full view of April 25, 2022, VA neurology consult note). There is no contrary medical opinion that associates the Veteran's migraines to his military service, and whether the Veteran's current headache disability is secondary to a service-connected disability will be addressed in the remand portion below. 

To the extent the Veteran contends that his current headache disability is a result of his conceded in-service noise exposure, he is not competent to provide a nexus opinion as the etiology of his headaches. See Rating Decision (March 2022) (conceded in-service noise exposure with grant of service connection for tinnitus).  Indeed, the etiology of a headache disability is an intricate matter that requires an understanding of the body's hearing mechanism, disease processes, and signs/symptoms of injury to those mechanisms. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d. at 1372; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (although it is error to categorically reject a non-expert opinion as to etiology, or nexus, not all questions of nexus are subject to non-expert opinion; whether a layperson is competent to provide a nexus opinion depends on the facts of the particular case). Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's opinion has no probative value in this matter.

In short, the persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding the Veteran's headache disability manifested while in service or to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period, or that the Veteran experienced continuity of symptomatology, and the persuasive evidence weighs heavily against that it is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Lastly, VA had not duty to provide an opinion on whether the Veteran's current headache disability was attributable to in-service noise exposure. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). There is no indication in the evidence that his current headache disability was related to his in-service noise exposure beyond the general lay assertions to trigger VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (distinguishing cases where only a conclusory generalized statement is provided by the veteran and rejecting the theory that medical examinations are to be routinely and virtually automatically provided to all veterans in disability cases involving nexus issues). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a headache disability as secondary to service-connected disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends his headaches are secondary to his service-connected PTSD and/or tinnitus. See Third Party Correspondence (November 2022); Web / HTML Documents (November 2022); VA Form 20-0996 (February 2023); see also C&P Exam (January 2022); CAPRI (November 2022) (Veteran reports tinnitus aggravates his headaches). 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a headache disability is remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate).

Here, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ obtained medical opinions (hereinafter, opinion) addressing secondary service connection. Specifically, December 2022 medical opinion concluded that the Veteran's headache disability is less likely than not proximately due to his service-connected PTSD. The rationale was:

The claimant was diagnosed with Migraine Headache by his private physician and a headache DBQ was submitted dated 08/22/2022.  Additionally, his private physician provided a letter stating, "In conclusion Posttraumatic stress disorder might not cause Migraine Headaches but might contribute and exacerbate the symptoms."  There is no evidence in the medical literature showing a causal relationship between PTSD and migraine headaches.  The claimant's migraine headaches are not the result of his service connected PTSD. Therefore, the claimed condition is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the veteran's service connected condition

Addressing the aggravation prong of secondary service connection, the opinion reflects that:

There is no evidence in the medical literature showing a causal relationship between PTSD and migraine headaches.  Therefore, the claimed condition was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by the claimant's service connected PTSD.

The Board find the opinion is inadequate for adjudicative purposes. First, the opinion improperly considered "proximate" causation when addressing the causation prong of secondary service connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364-66 (2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but-for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection). Second, the opinion does not address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection. See El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (indicating that findings of "not due to," "not caused by," and "not related to" a service-connected disability are insufficient to address the question of aggravation under § 3.310(b)). It appears, at best, to conflate causation with aggravation. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 90 (2018) (an examiner must provide a rationale that deals with causation and aggravation as independent concepts). Third, the opinion improperly relies on the absence of general medical literature without further discussing the specific facts of the case. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018). 

Additionally, the AOJ did not obtain an opinion addressing the Veteran's theory that his headache disability is secondary to service-connected tinnitus. A liberal reading of this pro se claimant's pleading raised that issue prior to the AOJ issuing the decision on appeal. See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552-553 (2008). Here, the record contains the Veteran's reports that his headaches are associated with ringing in his ears (tinnitus). The Veteran has established entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. See Rating Decision (March 2022). A claim for secondary service connection requires medical evidence that connects the asserted secondary disability to the service-connected disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). Hence, VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion addressing the claimed on headache disability as secondary to service-connected tinnitus was triggered. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion by H.J., a psychiatrist, received in November 2022, linking his migraine headaches to his PTSD. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (November 2022). The Board finds the opinion inadequate for adjudicative purposes. The opinion's rationale uses of the term "might," which suggests that the reasoning is less than certain and not necessary at least as likely as not. Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (use of term "could," without other rationale or supporting data, is speculative); Goss v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 109, 114 (1996) (use of the phrase "could not rule out" was too speculative to establish medical nexus); Tirpak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 609, 611 (1992) (medical opinions are speculative and of little or no probative value when physician makes equivocal findings such as "the veteran's death may or may not have been averted."). Moreover, the Board finds the essential rationale for the opinion is not discernable. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). Indeed, at most, the opinion provides the Board with medical findings and conclusions but the opinion does not reveal a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007). For example, the opinion notes the Veteran has diagnoses of migraine headaches and PTSD and notes a review of medical literature but does not provide a rationale statement connecting the two in support of the conclusion rendered. To the extent that the opinion references medical literature, the relevant of that literature to the opinion is unclear and not discussed vis-à-vis facts specific to the Veteran. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018) (reliance on the absence of medical literature supporting nexus without discussing the specific facts of the case renders an opinion inadequate). 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran asserts his current right knee disability had an onset during service when he experienced right knee pain and swelling with running and marching and was diagnosed as chondromalacia. See C&P Exam (April 2022); Third Party Correspondence (November 2022); HLR -Informal Conference (May 2023). In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a medical statement from his treating VA provider noting chondromalacia patella is the diagnosis of the breakdown and softening of cartilage which typically progresses into arthritis whether it is treated or not. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (May 2022). 

Alternatively, the Veteran asserts his right knee disability is secondary to overcompensation due to his left knee osteoarthritis, status post total knee replacement (non-service connected). See HLR -Informal Conference (May 2023). 

STRs show in April 1979, the Veteran presented with complaints of right knee pain for several hours and clinical evaluation revealed findings of crepitus behind his patella, painful and decreased motion, mild edema with moderate swelling, and tenderness along the patella; and an assessment of chondromalacia was given. See STR-Medical (December 2021). A May 1979 STR shows the Veteran again presented with complaints of right knee pain and notes a history of "pbm" and cracking with inflammation. See STR-Medical (December 2021). Subsequent STRs do not show complaints or treatment for right knee problems, and the February 1981 RME at separation shows normal evaluation of the bilateral lower extremities and he denied having or having had history of "swollen or painful joints" and "trick or locked knee" on the associated RMH. See STR-Medical (December 2021). 

Post-service medical records include an October 2019 VA right knee x-ray noting history of knee pain and findings of degenerative changes, and subsequent VA diagnostic testing reveals severe degeneration of medial compartment along with patellofemoral degeneration. See C&P Exam (January 2022); Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (March 2022); CAPRI (April 2022). 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. 

VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate).

Here, the record contains VA-obtained medical opinions dated in January 2022 and April 2022, and each medical opinion reflects that the Veteran's right knee disability is less likely than not related to in-service treatment for pain and swelling and diagnosis of chondromalacia of right knee based on the lack of continuity of care between 1979 and 2021. See C&P Exam (January 2022); C&P Exam (April 2022). The Board finds these VA-obtained opinions are inadequate because neither sufficiently informs the Board of the bases for the conclusion rendered. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). In support of the conclusion, each opinion notes that the lack of evidence of chronicity of care between 1979 and 2021 for right knee problems but neither opinion reveals a rationale connecting the medical findings to the conclusion. Rather, the opinion appears to solely rely on the absence of chronicity of care, but continuous treatment is not required for a grant of service connection and opinion provides no rationale addressing the assessment of chondromalacia along with complaints of pain and swelling documented during service. See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-96 (1997) (VA cannot reject a claim of service connection based on a lack of continuity of treatment); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 16, 19 (1991) ("regulations require a continuity of symptomatology, not continuity of treatment"). Additionally, neither VA-obtained opinion provides an adequate rationale discussing whether the right knee chondromalacia first noted in service could result in the Veteran's current right knee degenerative joint disease. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991) (the Board is not competent to substitute its own opinion for that of a medical expert). 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted the above referenced May 2022 medical statement from his treating VA provider, however, the statement does not include a medical conclusion or statement discussing the facts of this case; it is inadequate to support an award of service. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (March 2022); see also Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 295. Additionally, the Veteran submitted a physician's statement completed by D.H., MD, received in November 2022, links his right knee disability to his in-service injury, but the Board finds this opinion is inadequate as the essential rationale for the opinions is not discernable. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (November 2022); see also Monzingo, 26 Vet. App. at 106. In this instance, the opinion does not provide the Board with any reasoned rationale or medical explanation supporting the conclusions reached. See Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124. 

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD is remanded.

The July 29, 2022, rating decision awarded service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial rating of 50 percent effective from November 6, 2021. See Rating Decision (July 2022). The Veteran appealed the denial of an initial higher rating for PTSD. See VA Form 20-0996 (March 2023); VA Form 10182 (February 2024). Thus, the rating review period under appeal begins November 6, 2021, the award of service connection, and ends July 29, 2022, the date of the rating decision subject to the HLR rating decision on appeal. 

The issue on appeal is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the July 2022 rating decision subject to the HLR decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining relevant outstanding non-VA (private) treatment records identified by the record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records). Here, the record identifies the Veteran receives non-VA treatment for his PTSD from Dr. H.J., a psychiatrist, at Vitlink Psychiatric Services. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (March 2022). Additionally, VA treatment records note the Veteran reported receiving regular non-VA treatment for his PTSD from a psychiatrist at Vitlink. See CAPRI (April 2022); CAPRI (July 2022). Although in March 2023 the Veteran submitted an authorization for release, VA Form 21-4142, for those privately held records prior to the May 2023 HLR decision on appeal, the record does not reveal that VA identified the pre-decisional duty to assist error and attempted to obtain the referenced records. See VA Form 21-4142 (March 2023). As these private treatment records, if obtained, could bear on the outcome of the Veteran's claim, specific efforts should be made to procure them. Thus, since the March 2023 VA Form 21-4142 is over a year old, a remand is required to allow VA to ask the Veteran to submit a new authorize release of those identified, relevant treatment records.

The Veteran is reminded that VA's duty to assist in the development of a claim is not a one-way street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). The Veteran should cooperate and assist as requested in the development of the appeal.

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Dr. H.J. and Vitlink Psychiatric Services.  Make two requests for the authorized records from the identified facilities, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to address the etiology of the Veteran's headache disability. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal.

Optional: The clinician may consider the Veteran's history as to onset and progression; and any documented history in formulating an opinion.

The clinician must opine on: 

(a.) Whether the Veteran's headache disability is at least as likely as not caused by service-connected PTSD and/or tinnitus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" causation.

(b.) Alternatively, whether the Veteran's headache disability is at least as likely as not aggravated service-connected his PTSD and/or tinnitus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" aggravation-in other words, would the Veteran's headache disability be less severe "but for" his PTSD and/or tinnitus. 

Aggravation exists when nonservice-connected disability becomes functionally worsened due to an inability to treat the condition because of a service-connected disability.

Consider: (1) the Veteran's lay statement that ringing in his ears increases his headaches; (2) April 2022 VA neurology consult indicating migraines likely secondary to underlying structural source and noting sleep impairment as triggering factor; and (3) October 2022 private medical statement noting PTSD can contribute and exacerbate headaches. 

3. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to address the etiology of the Veteran's right knee disability. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal. 

The clinician should address the following:

Whether the Veteran's right knee disability, at least as likely as not, had its onset in service or is etiologically related to in-service complaints of right knee pain and swelling, assessment as chondromalacia in April 1979. Explain

Consider: (1) April 1979 STR showing complaints of right knee pain and findings of crepitus, edema, swelling, painful motion and assessment of chondromalacia in April 1979; (2) May 1979 STR showing complaints of right knee pain and history of "pmb" with cracking and inflammation; (3) February 1981 RME at separation noting normal bilateral lower extremity evaluation, and no history of knee problems on the associated RMH at separation; (4) October 2019 VA knee x-ray noting history of right knee pain and findings of degenerative changes and the March 2022 VA x-ray and MRI reports showing severe degeneration of medial compartment along with patellofemoral degeneration; and (5) May 2022 medical statement noting chondromalacia patella is the diagnosis of the breakdown and softening of cartilage which typically progresses into arthritis whether it goes treated or not. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (May 2022).
