FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Presumptive service connection for melanoma was established on August 10, 2022, the date of passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). 

2. Entitlement to secondary service connection for a left leg scar was established on the date that service connection was granted for the primary condition, August 10, 2022. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for dermatitis was established on August 4, 2022, the date VA received the Veteran's application to reopen his claim.  

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's dermatitis has manifested by involving less than 5 percent of his total body, less than 5 percent of his exposed areas, and has not required more than topical therapy.

5. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring, has been manifested by two painful scars.  

6. The Veteran's left leg surgical scars do not have a combined area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

7. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's migraines were not manifested by very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from November 1990 to May 1991.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in August 2022 and April 2023.  In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, for the claims pertaining to dermatitis, melanoma, and the left leg scar, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

With regard to the Veteran's claim pertaining to migraines, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for an increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

If the claim for service connection is received within one year of a veteran's discharge from service, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date will be the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  It is a fundamental tenet of Veterans law that the effective date awarded for a service-connected condition corresponds with the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 52, 58 (2011); 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Retroactive effective dates are allowed, to a certain extent, in cases where an award or increase of compensation is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).  Under these provisions, the claimant must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and have been continuously eligible from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination of entitlement.  These provisions apply to original and reopened claims, as well as claims for increase.  Id.; see also McCay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 183, 188 (1996), aff'd, 106 F.3d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  In such cases, the effective date of the award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).

When there is a prior final decision and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies.  In such cases, the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(r), 3.400(q)(2); Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  

Consistent with the case law aforementioned, a Veteran can attempt to overcome finality of the decision only through a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error, or by a claim to reopen based upon new and material evidence.  However, because the proper effective date for an award based on a claim to reopen could be no earlier than the date on which that claim was received, only a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) could result in the assignment of an earlier effective date.

Procedural Background

In January 2019, the Veteran filed an original claim for entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See January 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In July 2019, a rating decision was issued denying service connection for dermatitis, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See July 2019 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not appeal the January 2019 denial of service connection within the applicable time period and, as such, the decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. 

On August 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental application to reopen his claims for dermatitis, melanoma, and left leg surgical scars.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995. The Veteran sought entitlement based on the new presumptions of service connection created by the PACT Act.  Id.  

In a January 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for dermatitis, melanoma, and left leg surgical scars.  See January 2023 Rating Decision.  Service connection for dermatitis was granted on a direct basis and an effective date of August 4, 2022, was assigned.  Service connection for melanoma was granted pursuant to a presumption created by the PACT Act and an effective date of August 10, 2022, was assigned.  Service connection for left leg surgical scars was granted as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected melanoma and an effective date of August 10, 2022, was assigned.  Id.  

In a May 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed his assigned ratings as well as the effective dates for each of the aforementioned conditions.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182.  

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring, is denied. 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for his service-connected melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.  

38 C.F.R. § 3.114

In cases where a grant of compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, such as the PACT Act, retroactive effective dates may be allowed.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).  To be entitled to an earlier effective date, the claimant must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and have been continuously eligible from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination of entitlement.  Id.  These provisions apply to original and reopened claims.  Id.; see also McCay v. Brown, supra.  In such cases, the effective date of the award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue, which as to be explained below, is August 10, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).  If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than 1 year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of 1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request.  38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3).

On August 10, 2022, the PACT Act was signed into law.  This law increased veteran eligibility for benefits by expanding the lists of locations, timeframes, and presumptive conditions related to toxic exposures.  Under the PACT Act, melanoma is presumed to be associated with exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT).  Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168 (2022).  Eligibility for the presumption was established for veterans who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from August 1990 until the present time and had been diagnosed with one of the listed conditions, to include melanoma.  Id.   

On August 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental application to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for melanoma.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  In his application, the Veteran asserted entitlement based on "Pact legislation mak[ing] melanoma a Gulf War presumptive."  Id.  

In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for melanoma based on his presumptive exposure to airborne toxins during the Persian Gulf War.  See January 2023 Rating Decision.  An effective date of August 10, 2022, was assigned.  Id.

Here, the Veteran's diagnosis of melanoma preceded the date of the liberalizing legislation.  In June 2019, a VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had a history of malignant melanoma in the left leg.  See June 2019 Skin Conditions DBQ.  Further, the Board notes that the Veteran's status as a "Persian Gulf Veteran," pursuant to the criteria established by 38 U.S.C. § 1117, was confirmed in a January 2023 VA memorandum.  See January 2023 VA Memorandum.  As such, the Veteran was continuously eligible for entitlement to service connection from the effective date of the liberalizing law.  However, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a), the effective date of the award or increase shall not be earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue.

Given the facts above, it is apparent that the Veteran's current effective date of August 10, 2022, represents the earliest allowable effective date pursuant to the liberalizing law, the PACT Act, which conferred the presumption of service connection for melanoma based on the Veteran's Gulf War service.  As such, an earlier effective date is not warranted.

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date based on the provisions of 38 C.F.R § 3.400. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.400

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), the effective date of a grant of compensation for reopened claims shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Here, the date that the Veteran submitted a supplemental application to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for melanoma was August 4, 2022.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  

Consequently, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the earliest possible effective date would be the date of the Veteran's supplemental application, August 4, 2022 (six days prior to his currently assigned effective date).  To warrant the assignment of this effective date, entitlement would need to be based on another theory of service connection, such as direct service connection.  As explained above, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest available effective date based on presumptive entitlement.  While the Board acknowledges that development has not been done regarding alternate theories of entitlement, it finds that such action would not be appropriate for the current matter.

Notably, the Veteran has asserted entitlement based specifically on the presumptions created by the PACT Act.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  At no point throughout the history of the claim has the Veteran raised an alternate theory of entitlement.  Even in his initial application for service connection, which was subsequently finalized, the Veteran asserted that his melanoma was due to exposures during Desert Storm.  See January 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Moreover, as the Veteran's supplemental application date (August 4, 2022) and his currently assigned effective date (August 10, 2022) are separated by only six days, no extra benefit would be conferred upon the Veteran were the earlier effective date to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.31 dictates that "payment of monetary benefits based on original, supplemental, or increased awards of compensation, pension, dependency and indemnity compensation, or a monetary allowance ... may not be made for any period prior to the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective."  As the Veteran's supplemental application and his current effective date both fall within the same month, the Veteran would not be entitled to any additional monetary benefits were the earlier effective date claim to be granted.  

Given the above, and in the interest of conserving VA medical and judicial resources that would be obligated by further remand, the Board finds that the question of entitlement to an earlier effective date under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 is moot.

For the foregoing reasons, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for melanoma is denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a left lower leg surgical scar, secondary to melanoma, is denied.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for his service-connected left leg surgical scar.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.

In January 2019, the Veteran filed an original claim for entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See January 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In July 2019, a rating decision was issued denying service connection for dermatitis, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See July 2019 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not appeal the July 2019 denial of service connection within the applicable time period and, as such, the decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. 

On August 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental application to reopen his claim for left leg scarring.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  In a January 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for the Veteran's left leg scar on a secondary basis.  See January 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran's surgical scar was determined to be secondary to his service-connected melanoma and an effective date of August 10, 2022, was assigned.  Id.

The record reflects that the Veteran's scar was indeed the result of a melanoma excision performed in 2016.  See September 2022 Skin Conditions DBQ; September 2022 Scars/Disfigurement DBQ.   

Importantly, the effective date for service connection of a secondary disability cannot be earlier than the effective date of the disability upon which the secondary grant was based.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 49 (2010) (holding that "[i]t is axiomatic that there must be a primary service-connected condition for a claimant to establish entitlement to secondary service connection").  However, the Board is also cognizant that there is no temporal requirement inherent in 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  See Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131, 133 (U.S. 2017).  

In Frost, the Court held that for a Veteran to be service-connected on a secondary basis, the primary disability does not need to be service-connected, or even diagnosed, at the time the secondary condition is incurred.  Id.  That said, the Court did not find that a Veteran could receive an effective date for the secondary condition prior to the grant of service connection for his primary condition.  Rather, the Court clarified that "at the time that any decision establishing entitlement to secondary service connection is rendered, there must be a primary service-connected condition."  Id.  The Court was instructing VA to refrain from denying secondary disabilities on the sole basis that a primary disability was not service-connected or diagnosed at the time when the secondary disability was incurred.  This decision does not change the well-established rules in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 regarding the assignment of effective dates.  See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232 (2019). (the lesson of Frost is not that benefits may be awarded independent of the effective date for an underlying disability).  Accordingly, the Court's holding in Frost does not alter the Board's present analysis in determining whether an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is warranted.  

As noted above, the Veteran's leg scar is a direct result of a melanoma excision.  There is no evidence of record which supports another basis for the grant of service connection, nor has the Veteran has asserted that his left leg scar is due to any other cause.  Even if service connection were to be granted on a direct basis, no extra benefit would be conferred upon the Veteran as only six days separate the date of his application to reopen and his currently assigned effective date.  

Given that the Board has determined that August 10, 2022, is the appropriate effective date for melanoma, the effective date of the Veteran's left leg scars cannot precede that date.  As such, the Veteran is currently in receipt of the earliest possible effective date for his service-connected left leg scar.  In light of this, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for a left leg surgical scar is denied. 

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 4, 2022, for the grant of service connection for dermatitis, is denied.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for his service-connected dermatitis.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.  

In January 2019, the Veteran filed an original claim for entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See January 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In July 2019, a rating decision was issued denying service connection for dermatitis, melanoma, and surgical scars.  See July 2019 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not appeal the July 2019 denial of service connection within the applicable time period and, as such, the decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. 

On August 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental application to reopen his claim for dermatitis.  See August 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  In a January 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for dermatitis on a direct basis and an effective date of August 4, 2022, was assigned.  See January 2023 Rating Decision.

As discussed above, when there is a prior final decision and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies.  In such cases, the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(r), 3.400(q)(2); Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  

Here, the Veteran's reopened claim for dermatitis resulted in a grant of service connection.  Accordingly, the earliest available effective date is August 4, 2022, the date of the Veteran's supplemental application to reopen.  As the Veteran was already assigned an effective date of August 4, 2022, no further relief is warranted.

For the foregoing reasons, entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 4, 2022, is denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where a claimant timely appeals the rating initially assigned for the service-connected disability, VA must consider whether the claimant is entitled to "staged" ratings to compensate them for times since filing the claim when their disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the appeal.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts shown in every case. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for dermatitis is denied.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for dermatitis.  Importantly, as this is an appeal as to the initial rating assigned, the relevant temporal focus is from August 4, 2022, the effective date of the award of service connection. 

Rating Criteria

The Veteran's dermatitis is rated under DC 7806.  This diagnostic code instructs that dermatitis is to be evaluated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. 

Analysis

To warrant an initial compensable rating, the evidence must, at a minimum, more closely approximate the rating criteria for a 10 percent rating.  Upon review, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's dermatitis has not required more than topical therapy, nor has it manifested in lesions involving at least five percent of his entire body or five percent of his exposed body area. 

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his dermatitis.  See September 2022 Skin Conditions DBQ.  The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's diagnosis and indicated that it requires "constant/near constant" topical treatment.  Id.  The examiner further indicated that the Veteran had not undergone any other treatment or procedures, aside from topical therapy, in the past 12 months.  Id.  Upon physical examination, the examiner noted that less than five percent of the Veteran's total body area was affected and less than five percent of his exposed body area was affected.  Id.  

The Board finds the results of the September 2022 VA examination to be credible and highly probative in determining the extent of the Veteran's dermatitis symptomatology.  The Board further notes that, during the period on appeal, no other physical examinations were conducted to assess the extent of the Veteran's condition.  

While VA medication lists confirm the Veteran's prescriptions for topical treatments, there are no other records documenting complaints of, or treatment for, dermatitis during the period on appeal.  Similarly, there are no indications that the Veteran has undergone any systemic therapy during the period on appeal.  See VA Treatment Records. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology most closely approximates a noncompensable rating under DC 7806 and the General Formula for Rating Skin Conditions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  

The Board notes that it has a duty to acknowledge and consider all diagnostic codes that are potentially applicable when evaluating the Veteran's dermatitis.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991).  However, the Board has found that no other potentially applicable diagnostic codes would confer additional benefit upon the Veteran.  The General Formula provides that conditions may also be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck when appropriate.  The Board considered a rating under DC 7800, for disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, but finds that a minimum compensable rating would still not be met.  Notably, the Veteran does not satisfy the 10 percent criteria of having one of the eight characteristics of disfigurement.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7800. 

Given the above, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for dermatitis have not been met and, therefore, the claim is denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.   

5. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent, for melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring, is denied.

The Veteran seeks an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring.  Importantly, as this is an appeal as to the initial rating assigned, the relevant temporal focus is from August 10, 2022, the effective date of the award of service connection. 

Rating Criteria

Malignant melanoma is rated under DC 7833.  DC 7833 instructs that melanoma is to be rated as scars - DCs DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805.  Accordingly, the Veteran's melanoma, status post excision with painful scarring, is currently rated under DC 7804.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is assigned for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; a 20 percent rating is assigned for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; and a maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for five or more scars that are unstable or painful.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.  

DC 7804 has three additional notes which provide that: (1) An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. (2) If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. (3) Scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this diagnostic code, when applicable.

Analysis

To warrant an initial rating in excess of ten percent, the evidence must, at a minimum, more closely approximate the rating criteria for a twenty percent rating.  Upon review, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's melanoma scars manifests in two painful scars. 

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his scars.  See September 2022 Scars/Disfigurement DBQ.  The examiner identified two scars associated with the Veteran's melanoma excisions: one on the left lower extremity (LLE) and one documented as a left groin inguinal scar.  Id.  The Veteran reported experiencing pain and swelling in his surgical scars.  Id.  The examiner indicated that these scars were not unstable or characterized by the frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Id.  The scars were measured and the total area of the scars was recorded as 15.9cm2.  Id.  

The Board finds the results of the September 2022 VA examination to be credible and highly probative in determining the extent of the Veteran's painful scarring.  The Board further notes that, during the period on appeal, no other physical examinations were conducted to assess the extent of the Veteran's condition, nor has the Veteran asserted that he has more than two painful or unstable scars due to his melanoma excisions.  

VA treatment records for the period on appeal confirm the Veteran's history of melanoma but are otherwise silent to complaints of, or treatment for, painful or unstable scarring.  See VA Treatment Records. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology most closely approximates a 10 percent rating under DC 7804.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804.  The Board notes that the Veteran's melanoma surgical scars are also rated under DC 7802 and his claim for an increased rating under that diagnostic code will be discussed in the following section.  

As the Veteran's melanoma scars do not more closely approximate the criteria for a 20 percent rating under DC 7804, the claim is denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.   

6. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a left leg scar, secondary to melanoma, is denied.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his left leg scar, secondary to his melanoma.  Importantly, as this is an appeal as to the initial rating assigned, the relevant temporal focus is from August 10, 2022, the effective date of the award of service connection.

Rating Criteria

The Veteran's left leg scar is rated under DC 7802 for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802.  

Based on DC 7802, it provides that a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating.  Id.  

There are two notes associated with DC 7802 which provide that: (1) For the purposes of DCs 7801 and 7802, the six (6) zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk.  The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk. (2)  A separate evaluation may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under this diagnostic code if there are multiple scars, or a single scar, affecting multiple zones of the body. Combine the separate evaluations under § 4.25.  Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under this diagnostic code.

Analysis

To warrant a compensable rating under DC 7802, the Veteran's scar/s must have an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.).  Upon review, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against such a finding.  

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his scars.  See September 2022 Scars/Disfigurement DBQ.  The examiner identified two scars associated with the Veteran's melanoma excisions: one on the LLE and one documented as a left groin inguinal scar.  Id.  The Veteran reported experiencing pain and swelling in his surgical scars.  Id.  The examiner indicated that these scars were not characterized by instability with the frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Id.  The scars were measured, and the total area of the scars was recorded as 15.9cm2.  Id.  The LLE scar had measurements of 12cm x 0.7cm and the left groin scar was measured as 5cm x 1.5cm.  Id.  

The Board finds the September 2022 VA examination report highly probative in determining the size of the Veteran's scars and notes that there are no other measurements of record during the period on appeal.

In light of this evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran was appropriately assigned a noncompensable rating by the AOJ.  There is no evidence to suggest that the Veteran's scars have a total area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.).  As such, the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating, under DC 7802, is denied.  

The Board notes that the Veteran is already compensated for the painful nature of these scars under DC 7804 (as explained above) and finds that there are no other applicable diagnostic codes which would confer a greater benefit.  In reaching the foregoing conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine is not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.   

7. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent, for service-connected migraines, is denied. 

The Veteran seek an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected migraines.  Importantly, as this is an appeal as to the initial rating assigned, the relevant temporal focus is from July 5, 2022, the effective date of the award of service connection.

Rating Criteria

The Veteran's migraine headaches are rated under DC 8100.  Under this DC, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there are characteristic prostrating attacks averaging once every two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is appropriate when there are characteristic prostrating attacks averaging once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent rating is appropriate when there are very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  A noncompensable rating is warranted when attacks are less frequent than as required for a 10 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100. 

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" means migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a), DC 8100; see also Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 246 (2018).  In other words, the term prostrating takes on its plain meaning of lacking in vitality or will; powerless to rise; laid low.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contains several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraine attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id.  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a), DC 8100. Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  See Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445-46 (2004).

Analysis

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran, in his May 2023 VA Form 10182, appealed the initial noncompensable rating assigned for his migraines.  This rating was already adjusted to 30 percent after a higher-level review was conducted by the AOJ.  See October 2022 Rating Decision.  However, in an effort to liberally construe the Veteran's appeal, the Board will assume that he is seeking a rating in excess of his initial 30 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).

To warrant an initial rating in excess of 30 percent, the evidence from the period on appeal must satisfy the criteria for a 50 percent rating.  Upon review, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against such a finding. 

In July 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his migraines.  See July 2022 Headaches DBQ.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with migraine headaches and indicated an onset date of 2006.  Id.  The Veteran denied experiencing prostrating headaches but reported head pain with associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting.  The Veteran reported experiencing these headaches two times per month.  Id.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches cause nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sounds.  Id.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not experience prostrating and prolonged attacks and noted that the typical duration of head pain was less than one day.  Id.  Lastly, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's headaches do not impact his ability to work.  Id.  

The Board finds the results of the July 2022 VA examination report persuasive in determining the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches.  The Board further notes that the record is otherwise silent to complaints of, or treatment for, migraines during the period on appeal.  

Based on the evidence from the period on appeal, the Board finds that the Veteran's migraines do not fully satisfy the criteria for a 50 percent rating.  

With regard to frequency, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran experiences "very frequent" migraine attacks.  During the July 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported experiencing headaches two times per month.  As this exceeds the once-a-month criteria used in the 30 percent rating, the Board finds that the frequency element has been satisfied.  The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to testify regarding observable symptomatology, including frequency, and finds his reports credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

However, regarding the elements of severity, duration, and economic inadaptability, the Board finds that persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim.  Notably, during the July 2022 VA examination, the Veteran denied experiencing prostrating attacks.  As noted above, the Board finds the Veteran's reports credible.  The Board also notes that the criteria for a 50 percent rating require "completely prostrating" attacks as opposed to the 30 percent criteria which just require "prostrating attacks."  38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a), DC 8100.  While the Veteran's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photosensitivity, and sensitivity to sound may leave the Veteran with a lack of vitality, the evidence does not support a finding that these symptoms render him completely powerless to rise.  

Further, the only evidence pertaining to the duration of these attacks and their economic impact comes from the July 2022 VA examination report.  To that end, the examiner noted that the Veteran's headaches typically last less than one day and do not impact his ability to work.  The Board finds these opinions persuasive and notes that the Veteran has not asserted that his symptoms persist for extended periods of time or that they affect his ability to work.  

In Johnson v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims concluded that DC 8100 is successive, meaning that "each disability level builds on another in terms of duration and frequency, requiring . . . a veteran rated at a higher level to satisfy all the requirements of the lower levels." 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018).  The Court also held that the criteria for a 50 percent rating under DC 8100 are conjunctive, meaning that a 50 percent disability rating requires evidence that a claimant's migraine attacks are (1) very frequent, (2) completely prostrating and prolonged, and (3) "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Id.  If one of these elements is missing, like in this case, a claimant is not entitled to a 50 percent disability rating.  See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007). 

As the evidence from the period on appeal does not reflect that the Veteran experiences very frequent, completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability, the claim for an increased initial rating is denied.  

In reaching the foregoing conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the issue, that doctrine not applicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, supra; 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
