FINDING OF FACT

In August 2024 correspondence, the Veteran withdrew the appeal for the above issues.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for the above issues have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1993 to January 1995, January 1997 to December 2006, June 2007 to September 2007, April 2008 to July 2008, May 2009 to August 2009, March 2010 to June 2010, February 2011 to May 2011, and from March 2012 to September 2015.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran elected the Board's Hearing docket.  See February 2024 VA Form 10182.

The Board may dismiss any appeal, or any issues within an appeal, which fail to allege specific errors of fact or law.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Any or all issues involved in an appeal may be withdrawn at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  Withdrawal may be made by an appellant or by an appellant's authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In August 2024, the Veteran withdrew from appellate consideration the appeal for the issues of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee degenerative joint disease status post meniscectomy, entitlement to service connection for a low back condition, entitlement to service connection for left leg radiculopathy, entitlement to service connection for right leg radiculopathy, entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, and entitlement to service connection for IBS.
