REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had extensive honorable active duty service in the United States Air Force from September 1971 to September 1991. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In November 2023, the Veteran filed a request for higher level review. In March 2024, the RO issued a higher-level review decision that continued to deny the Veteran's claims. In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182. In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 RO decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for heart impairment atrial fibrillation, service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, and service connection for prostate condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for heart impairment atrial fibrillation. 

The Veteran contends that he should be service connected for heart impairment, atrial fibrillation. 

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner noted that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of valvular heart disease. The examiner noted that the valves affected are the mitral, tricuspid. The examiner noted that the Veteran's condition impacted the Veteran's ability to perform any type of occupational task and decreased productivity due to shortness of breath. The March 2023 examiner opined that the Veteran's heart impairment atrial fibrillation is likely as not due to military exposure as research has proven that exposures can result in coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiac disease. 

In July 2023, a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) assessment was completed. The examiner noted that the Veteran did have TERA exposure. The October 2023 examiner was provided with this information and opined that the condition is less likely as not due to military exposure or agent orange as research has proven that exposure can result in CAD and cardia arrythmia. The examiner found that there is no medical literature or known medical knowledge that would suggest a nexus between any toxic exposure and valvular heart disease; therefore, the claimed valvular heart disease was less likely than not after considering potential exposure through all military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities. The Board finds that the March 2023 VA examiner provided an inadequate opinion and examination as there was no consideration for service-connected conditions. Additionally, the Board finds that the examiner's opinion gave a conflicting opinion that was unclear and vague as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed condition.

The Board finds that the RO relied on an inadequate examination to determine that the Veteran was not entitled to service connection for his claimed heart condition, atrial fibrillation. The Board notes that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of valvular heart disease. The Board also notes that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with hypertension. The Board finds that the RO failed to obtain a medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's valvular heart disease was caused by or is otherwise related to the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.

The Board finds that the RO made a pre-decisional duty to assist error when it failed to obtain an adequate examination and opinion. Failing to obtain an adequate examination and relying on an inadequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). This pre-decisional duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by providing the Veteran a new VA examination that includes an adequate opinion and rationale.

One of the effects of the AMA is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the RO for further development instead of immediately deciding them directly.  Nevertheless, even under the AMA, the Board still has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  See Pub L. No. 115-55 section (2)(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

 2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran contends that he should be service connected for obstructive sleep apnea. 

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for sleep apnea. The examiner noted that the Veteran does have a current diagnosis of sleep apnea. The examiner also noted that it may be related to the Veteran's allergies. The Board notes that the examiner noted that the Veteran uses a CPAP and does have persistent daytime hypersomnolence. The examiner noted that the Veteran's sleep apnea causes fatigue that would affect his productivity. The March 2023 examiner opined that it is less likely as not that there is no research that has linked exposure to agent orange to sleep apnea. 

The Board notes that the March 2023 VA examiner did not consider whether the Veteran's sleep apnea could be caused by or otherwise related to a service-connected condition, such as hypertension, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, or chronic adjustment disorder. The Board finds that the March 2023 VA examiner provided an inadequate opinion and examination as there was no consideration for service-connected conditions. Additionally, the Board finds that the examiner's opinion gave a conflicting opinion that was unclear and vague as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed condition The Board further notes that the Veteran is diagnosed with and service-connected for chronic adjustment disorder. The Board finds that consideration should be given as to whether the medications the Veteran takes for service-connected conditions or whether a service-connected condition may have caused or otherwise be related to the Veteran's currently diagnosed sleep apnea. 

The Board finds that the RO made a pre-decisional duty to assist error when it failed to obtain an adequate examination and opinion. Failing to obtain an adequate examination and relying on an inadequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). This pre-decisional duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by providing the Veteran a new VA examination that includes an adequate opinion and rationale.

No. 115-55 section (2)(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

3. Entitlement to service connection for prostate condition.

The Veteran contends that he should be service connected for a prostate condition.  

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran indicated that he did not want to have his prostate examined. The March 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate disorder is as likely as likely as not due to direct military exposure to agent orange as research has proven that exposures can result in cancer of the prostate. The examiner noted that Agent Orange exposure limits the growth of the prostate gland. The examiner further noted that studies show toxins might suppress male hormones, causing infertility and decreased bone and muscle. The Board further notes that a TERA opinion was obtained in October 2023.

The Board notes that the March 2023 examiner did not indicate whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a prostate condition as the examiner noted that the Veteran did not want to have his prostate examined. The Board notes that the examiner provided a positive nexus opinion in March 2023. However, the October 2023 TERA opinion indicated that it was less likely as not due to direct military exposure to Agent Orange, then indicated that Agent Orange does limit the growth of the prostate gland. The Board finds that there are conflicting opinions in the way that the examiner addressed the opinion, saying it is not related but then saying that it is within the same opinion. The Board finds that the examination is inadequate. 

The Board finds that the RO made a pre-decisional duty to assist error when it failed to obtain an adequate examination and opinion. Failing to obtain an adequate examination and relying on an inadequate examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed heart impairment, atrial fibrillation. 

The examiner should be provided a copy of the Veteran's service treatment records, prior VA examinations, a copy of this Remand, and any lay statements. 

The examiner must address the following:

(a) Identify all heart conditions or impairments that the Veteran is diagnosed with.

(b) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed heart condition, atrial fibrillation, currently diagnosed valvular heart disease, or any other heart condition was caused by or aggravated by any of the Veteran's service-connected conditions? 

The examiner is asked to specifically consider the Veteran's service-connected hypertension.

Aggravation is defined as any worsening beyond the natural progression of the disability.  The examiner should establish a baseline level of all diagnosed disabilities prior to aggravation.

The examiner must address causation and aggravation. 

(b) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed heart condition, atrial fibrillation, currently diagnosed valvular heart disease, or any other diagnosed heart condition, was caused by toxic exposure or herbicide agent orange exposure?

The examiner is reminded that toxic exposure and herbicide agent exposure have been conceded. 

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. 

If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, the medical professional must indicate such and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. 

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea. 

The examiner should be provided a copy of the Veteran's service treatment records, prior VA examinations, a copy of this Remand, and any lay statements. 

The examiner must address the following:

(a) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's claimed obstructive sleep apnea, was caused by or aggravated by any of the Veteran's service-connected conditions? 

The examiner is asked to specifically consider the Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder, all medications that the Veteran takes for his mental health condition, and to determine whether the Veteran has obesity.

Aggravation is defined as any worsening beyond the natural progression of the disability.  The examiner should establish a baseline level of all diagnosed disabilities prior to aggravation.

The examiner must address causation and aggravation. 

The fact that the Veteran may not have a disease presumed to be service connected for Veterans exposed to herbicide agents / Agent Orange in Southwest Asia should not be used as a reason for finding that this Veteran's sleep apnea is not related to exposure to an herbicide agent.? 

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.
