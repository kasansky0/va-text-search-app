DOCKET NO. 240131-412983
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to January 3, 2024, for additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran and M.W. were married in 2018.

2. In April 2022, the Veteran was notified of his initial award of service-connected benefits at a rate in excess of 30 percent effective February 3, 2021, and also notified that he was being paid as a single veteran with no dependents and that he should notify VA of any change in dependents.

3. On January 3, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents adding M.W. as a dependent spouse. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction thereafter added M.W. as a dependent spouse effective January 3, 2024, with payments beginning February 1, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's spouse, M.W. have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.50, 3.217, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably from July 2018 to December 2019.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for additional dependency benefits for the Veteran's spouse is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of additional dependency allowance for his spouse, M.W. 

A veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent, including a spouse. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).

38 U.S.C. § 5110(f) provides that "[a]n award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action."

The effective date of the award of any benefits or increase of benefits by reason of marriage shall be the date of the marriage, if proof of marriage is received by VA within a year from the date of the marriage. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(n).

The effective date of an award of additional compensation for dependents will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The term "date of claim" means the following, listed in their order of applicability: (i) Date of veteran's marriage, or birth of his or her child, or, adoption of a child, if the evidence of the event is received within one year of the event; otherwise (ii) date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within one year of VA's request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(1).

The earliest possible effective date for additional compensation for dependents shall be the same date as the decision giving rise to such entitlement, provided that proof of dependent status is submitted within one year of notice of that decision. Sharp v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 267, 276 (2009).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.204, VA will accept, for the purposes of determining entitlement to VA benefits, the statement of a Veteran as proof of marriage, provided that the statement contains certain required information, to include the date and place of the marriage. With respect to additional compensation for dependents, a Veteran "must provide the social security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is seeking benefits." 38 C.F.R. § 3.204. Also, a Veteran "shall, as a condition for receipt... of benefits, furnish [VA] upon request with... the social security number of any dependent... on whose behalf, or based upon whom, benefits are sought." 38 C.F.R. § 3.216; 38 U.S.C. § 5101(c)(1).

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date for adding a dependent spouse is not warranted.

In an April 2022 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD and assigned a 70 percent evaluation effective February 3, 2021. 

The Veteran was notified of the April 2022 rating decision by a letter dated April 6, 2022. The letter specifically stated that the Veteran's combined evaluation is 30 percent or more disabling, that he may be eligible for additional benefits based on dependency, and that VA may be able to pay him retroactive benefits for dependents if he submitted a dependency claim within a year from the date of the letter. No response to this letter was received.

The Veteran initially submitted information about his marriage on January 3, 2024, including M.W.'s name, social security number and date of marriage. Specifically, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents adding M.W. to his award. In a January 5, 2024, decision, the AOJ added M.W. as a dependent spouse effective January 3, 2024, with payment to begin February 1, 2024. 

The Veteran now seeks an effective date prior to January 3, 2024, the date the AOJ received his VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents. 

As noted above, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b), the effective date of an award of additional compensation for dependents will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award.

The date of claim is defined as the date of the Veteran's marriage, if evidence of the marriage is received within one year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence and marriage to the dependent, if evidence is received within one year of VA's request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(1).

The earliest relevant date is the date the Veteran married M.W. in 2018; however, the date of a veteran's marriage can only be the effective date if evidence of the marriage within one year of the event. VA did not receive evidence of the Veteran's marriage to M.W. within one year of the marriage, and as such, the date of marriage such cannot be considered a "date of claim" pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

Instead, the Veteran initially provided evidence of his marriage to M.W. as a dependent on January 3, 2024, when he submitted his VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents. There is no evidence of a dependency claim for M.W. prior to January 2024. Further, to the extent that the Veteran may have referenced M.W.'s existence prior to 2021, the Veteran did not qualify for additional compensation for a dependent at this time. 

The next relevant date is February 3, 2021, the date the first (and most recent) qualifying disability rating became effective. However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3) provides that the effective date of the qualifying disability is only appropriate if evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action. As mentioned, the Veteran was notified of this by letter dated April 6, 2022, and he did not provide proof of dependents within one year of this notice letter.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b), the effective date of an award of additional compensation for dependents will be the latest of the dates discussed above. Based on the foregoing, the latest applicable effective date is January 3, 2024-the date in which VA received his VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents, with payment to commence on February 1, 2024, the first day of the following month.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to January 3, 2024, for the addition payment for the Veteran's spouse as a dependent have not been met. The claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5101(c)(1), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.31, 3.109, 3.158, 3.204, 3.213(a), 3.216, 3.401(b).
