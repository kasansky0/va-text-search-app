REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from May 1985 to October 2010.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2023 rating decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023  rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 decision.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected lumbosacral strain, spondylosis, and facet arthropathy, is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve is remanded.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error in order to obtain missing VA treatment records and private treatment records.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  In her application, the Veteran indicated that she was receiving treatment through VA.  A review of the Veteran's file reflects that there are no VA treatment records associated with the record during the appellate period. See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2020 (holding that it is reasonable to presume VA is in the constructive possession of any and all VA medical records for an applicant during the appellate time frame).  On remand, any outstanding treatment records must be obtained.

Additionally, in January 2023, a private examiner provided a medical opinion.  In arriving to their medical opinion, the examiner cited the Veteran's civilian treatment records.  A review of the Veteran's file reflects that additional private treatment records have not been associated with the file.  A remand is warranted to obtain the private medical treatment records.

Because the clinical records of the treatment, if obtained, could bear on the outcome of the Veteran's appeal, efforts must be made to procure them.  38 U.S.C. § 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Obtain copies of records pertaining to any VA treatment the Veteran has received.  The evidence obtained, if any, should be associated with the record.

2. Ask the Veteran to provide a release for relevant records of treatment from any private practitioners, and to identify, and provide appropriate releases for, any other care providers who may possess new or additional evidence pertinent to the issues on appeal.  If she provides the necessary release(s), assist her in obtaining the records identified, following the procedures set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.  Any new or additional (i.e., non-duplicative) evidence received should be associated with the record.  If any of the records sought are not available, the record should be annotated to reflect that fact, and the Veteran and her representative should be notified.
