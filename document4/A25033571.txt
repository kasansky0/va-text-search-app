An initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and probative evidence shows moderate incomplete paralysis of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve).

2. The competent and probative evidence shows moderate incomplete paralysis of the right lower extremity (sciatic nerve).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.124a, DC 8520.

2. The criteria for an initial rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity (sciatic nerve) are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.124a, DC 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from September 1993 to July 1997.  

An August 26, 2022, rating decision granted service connection for the above disorders and assigned 10 percent ratings. The Veteran requested higher-level review in July 2023. His ratings were continued in September 2023 and earlier effective dates were denied. The Veteran timely appealed the September 2023 rating decision to the Board and requested the Board's Direct Review docket in a September 2024 VA Form 10182 and appealed only the issues listed on the title page. 

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider the evidence of record as of August 26, 2022-the date of the rating decision which prompted the higher-level review requested. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 3.2601(f). If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after August 26, 2022, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

The Board also recognizes that after the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran filed a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities in September 2024. See 9/23/2024, VA 21-8940. The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is within the Board's jurisdiction under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) when the evidence of unemployability is submitted prior to the AOJ decision, or during an applicable evidence window, and pertains to the period on appeal for the associated increased rating claim. The Board has also considered whether an inferred claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) has been raised. In this matter, there is no evidence of unemployability prior to the August 2022 rating decision due to his radiculopathy currently on appeal; specifically, the evidence does not show any functional impact due to the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy as shown in the VA treatment records and August 2022 VA examination. Thus, the Board finds that Rice is inapplicable since there is no evidence of unemployability due to the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. As such, TDIU is not before the Board at this time. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentages are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, the Board must also consider staged ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by their senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve)

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve)

The Veteran asserts entitlement to initial ratings of 20 percent. He is rated under DC 8520. Specifically, the Veteran, through his attorney-representative, contends his symptoms were more nearly approximated as moderate. See 9/5/2024, Appellate Brief. 

Complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve exists when the foot dangles and drops, there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost. This is evaluated as 80 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy is evaluated as 60 percent disabling. Moderately severe paralysis is evaluated as 40 percent disabling. Moderate paralysis is evaluated as 20 percent disabling, and mild paralysis is 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Code 8520. The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for "complete paralysis" given for each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating for incomplete paralysis should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves, Note [to the prior rating schedule].

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Rating Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citations omitted). Absent an express definition, it is presumed that VA regulations employ words using their ordinary dictionary meanings at the time the regulations were promulgated. See Nielson v. Shinseki, 607 F.3d 802, 805-06 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that when terms are not defined, it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that they are deemed to have their ordinary meaning).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) does not "carry the force of law." DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (2017). It is "an internal manual used to convey guidance to VA adjudicators. It is not intended to establish substantive rules beyond those contained in statute and regulation." Id. (quoting 72 Fed. Reg. 66,218, 66,219 (Nov. 27, 2007)).

The M-21 provisions do not go through the regular rulemaking procedures and is little more than evidence as to how VBA applies law and regulation in practices; it is not binding on the Board as it is not a regulation, instruction of the Secretary, or OGC opinion. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). The regulations further clarify that the Board "is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues." 38 C.F.R. § 20.105.

In Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018), however, the CAVC held that the Board is required to discuss "any relevant provisions contained in the [M-21] as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases, but because it is not bound by those provisions, it must make its own determination before it chooses to rely on an [M-21] provision as a factor to support its decision." The CAVC has stated, on at least two prior occasions, that, where the rating applicable rating criteria contains terms that are undefined, the Board must define those terms as it applies them to the veteran at hand in order to satisfy its obligation to provide adequate reasons or bases. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 254-55 (2018); Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219-20 (2018).

VA's M21-1 provides benchmarks for evaluating the severity of peripheral nerve conditions. See M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c. The Manual indicates with regard to "mild" as follows: As this is the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve this is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for service connection purposes. In general, look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

The Manual indicates with regard to "moderate:" Symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling. In such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms. Other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

For moderately severe incomplete paralysis, it is described as follows: the?moderately severe evaluation level is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve. This is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in?38 CFR 4.123. Motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at?a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy see the criteria for a severe evaluation under?38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. 

Finally, the Manual indicates with regard to "severe:" In general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, those standards are "'relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims,' which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision." Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 18 (2021) (quoting Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312, 321 (2021)).

VA has recognized that moderate incomplete paralysis will likely be described by the Veteran and medically graded as significantly disabling and may be demonstrated by combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. In Miller v. Shulkin, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "[a]lthough the note preceding § 4.124a directs the claims adjudicator to award no more than a 20% disability rating for incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve where the condition is productive of wholly sensory manifestations, it does not logically follow that any claimant who also exhibits non-sensory manifestations must necessarily be rated at a higher level." 28 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2017).

Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Affairs held that the assignment of ratings based on paralysis does not preclude separate ratings for neuritis or neuralgia of the same nerve. Banschbach v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 422, 429 (2024). The Court explained that each nerve has a diagnostic code and rating scale for paralysis, as well as additional diagnostic codes (but no ratings) for "neuritis" and "neuralgia." Id. at 426. The Court acknowledged that adjudicators must avoid pyramiding, i.e., evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses. However, the Court noted that the rating schedule provides that separate conditions or manifestations of the same condition are to be rated separately, unless otherwise provided by the rating schedule. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25(b). Id. at 428. Moreover, the Court concluded that the Board must exhaust all schedular alternative for rating a disability. See Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 168 (2019). The Court further noted that paralysis, neuritis, and neuralgia are uniquely defined, indicating that each may present separately ratable manifestations. Id.

Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe incomplete paralysis. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by such organic changes will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. Tic douloureux may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

Turning towards the relevant evidence of record, the Veteran underwent an examination in August 2022. See 8/5/2022, VA Examination. The Veteran had mild intermittent pain and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias. Muscle strength testing was normal (5/5), and he did not have muscle atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes were normal (2+). He had decreased sensory testing for each lower leg/ankle and foot/toes. No trophic changes were reported, and his gait was normal. The examiner indicated bilateral mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerves. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records show bilateral numbness and painful pins and needles. See 4/25/2022, CAPRI. Neuritis was briefly reported in June 2022. See 8/9/2022, CAPRI. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence, the Board finds that initial ratings of 20 percent, but no higher, for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy (sciatic nerve) is warranted. In support, the Board notes several pieces of probative evidence, to include that the Veteran's various radiculopathy symptoms have been described as mild as shown in the VA examination. The Veteran also reported numbness and pins and needles sensation in his feet. His sensory testing was decreased as shown in the August 2022 examination. 

The Board also finds that ratings in excess of the now assigned 20 percent ratings is not warranted at any point during the period on appeal. The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy attributable to his radiculopathy as reported in the noted VA examination described above. The Board acknowledges his computerized problem list showed left foot drop. However, the credible 2022 examination report, that includes a physical examination of the Veteran, did not show symptoms more nearly approximated as left foot drop. See 8/9/2022, CAPRI. The Veteran has had decreased sensation testing. The Board finds these symptoms to be more nearly approximated as a 20 percent rating for moderate symptoms as it shows combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes. Additionally, the competent VA examiner, when characterizing the Veteran's radiculopathy symptoms during this period on appeal, have found them to be mild as recorded in the examination report. Indeed, the examination report reflected, at most, mild symptoms, such as paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and intermittent pain. Overall, the above examination report reflects a disability picture of the bilateral lower radiculopathy that is of moderate severity to include being medically graded as significantly disabling. 

As such, after looking at the overall disability picture for the bilateral lower extremity, the Board finds the Veteran's symptoms were not more nearly approximated as moderately severe as he did not have motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. For example, the examination report in 2022 shows the knee and ankle to be 2+ (normal) upon reflex examination. For the foregoing reasons, ratings in excess of 20?percent?are not more nearly approximated or warranted.?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

The Board finds the VA examination of record to be competent and probative as the evidence was gathered by a medical professional who physically examined the Veteran.

Lastly, the Board finds that separate ratings for neuritis or?neuralgia?are not warranted here. The evidence of record does not show neuritis and?neuralgia. The Board acknowledges the VA treatment records noting neuritis. However, it appears from the treatment note that it was used interchangeably with neuropathy and not a separate diagnosis. See 8/9/2022, CAPRI. In this regard, the Veteran was a walk-in patient/transferred from another provided and reported peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran reported he did not like to use medications, but preferred massage therapy and acupuncture for neuritis. The evidence of record does not show a separate diagnosis of neuritis. Furthermore, there is no evidence on record of loss of reflex. Thus, the Board finds that separate ratings are not warranted. For the foregoing reasons, initial ratings in excess of 20 percent are not more nearly approximated or warranted throughout the period on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
