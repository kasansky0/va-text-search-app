ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chloracne is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, upper extremities is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for glaucoma is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for acid reflux is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for memory loss is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for anxiety attacks is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has had chloracne of the left arm, glaucoma, or peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities either approximate to or during the pendency of the claim.

2. The Veteran's hearing loss is manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level II in the right ear and Level III in the left ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chloracne have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 5103, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy upper extremities have not been met.   38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 5103, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.16, 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1965 to July 1973.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) electing evidence review by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Veteran submitted the claim on appeal using a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. The complete VA Form 21-526EZ includes 'Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits,' which contains explicit notice to the claimant that "You are entitled to a hearing at any time in the claims process. If you wish to have a hearing or have other questions, contact VA online through Ask VA: https://ask.va.gov or call us toll-free at 1-800-827-1000 (TTY:711)." By signing the VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran certified they received the notice attached to their application. Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ issued its initial decision on appeal.

Finally, the Veteran's April 2024 VA Form 10182 indicated he was appealing a June 23, 2023, decision. However, based on the issues identified by the Veteran on the Form 10182, the Board has interpreted the Veteran's April 2024 Form 10182 as a timely appeal of the March 2024 rating decision, which addressed the issues identified by the Veteran.  The Board notes that the Veteran's representative in the March 2025 informal hearing presentation has essentially confirmed that the Veteran was appealing that decision.  Thus, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in the Board's interpretation of the appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 763 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Certain listed medical conditions may be granted service connection on a presumptive basis due to presumed exposure to herbicide agents, such as Agent Orange. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6)(iii); 3.309(e). If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent (to include Agent Orange) during active service, certain diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. §3.307 (a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38C.F.R. §3.307 (d) are also satisfied. These diseases include, but are not limited to, chloracne or other acneform diseases consistent with chloracne and early-onset peripheral neuropathy. 38 C.F.R. §3.309 (e).

If a disease is not listed as a condition presumptively associated with herbicide agent exposure, service connection may still be established if probative evidence shows an association between the condition and the in-service herbicide agent exposure.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional." Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d at 1337.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for chloracne 

2. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings regarding left arm chloracne: "Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded. You have Vietnam service from May 28, 1969 to June 3, 1969. You have sufficient service to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection." 

Regarding the claimed upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, the following favorable findings were made: "Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded. You have Vietnam service from May 28, 1969 to June 3, 1969." 

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain any reports or finding of chloracne or peripheral neuropathy. The service separation examination in July 1973 noted normal skin and neurologic findings. On the Report of Medical History completed at that time, the Veteran denied skin diseases and neuritis.

The Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence showing complaints or treatment for chloracne or peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities at any time since service.

In this case, VA has conceded the Veteran's herbicide agent exposure based on service in the Republic of Vietnam. However, while the presumption of service connection for herbicide-related diseases are available for the above listed conditions, the record does not support that the Veteran has been diagnosed with chloracne or peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

The Board is aware that VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  

In this case, the only current evidence of chloracne and peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities is on the Veteran's application for service connection. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that VA is not required to provide a medical examination when there is not credible evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010). Additionally, a mere conclusory generalized lay statement that service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010). Thus, a VA examination is not warranted in this case.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). As the evidence persuasively weighs against the appeal, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. The claim of entitlement to service connection for chloracne, glaucoma, and peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremities is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38C.F.R. §4.7. When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Hearing loss ratings range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with average hearing thresholds determined by puretone audiometric testing at frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 cycles per second. "Puretone threshold average" is the average of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hertz. This average is used in all cases (including those in §4.86) to determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from TABLE VI or VIA. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100.

The rating schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness. The horizontal rows in TABLE VI represent nine categories of the percentage of discrimination based on the controlled speech discrimination test. The vertical columns in TABLE VI represent nine categories of decibel loss based on the puretone audiometry test. The Roman numeral designation is located at the point where the percentage of speech discrimination and puretone threshold average intersect. Id. 

Under certain exceptional patterns of hearing impairment, auditory acuity levels may be calculated using either TABLE VI, as described above, or TABLE VIA, which derives a Roman numeral designation based solely on the puretone audiometry test. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. The TABLE that produces the higher Roman numeral will be used. Id. These auditory acuity levels are entered into TABLE VII of the rating schedule to determine the percentage disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

The Veteran underwent a VA audiological examination in December 2023. The Veteran reported that he needed the television louder and that he had difficulty hearing his wife at times.

Puretone thresholds (in decibels) and speech discrimination scores were as follows:

 	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	15	20	20	55	28	84%

LEFT	20	30	90	100+	60	86%

As shown in the table, objective testing produced a puretone threshold average of 28 decibels in the right ear and 60 decibels in the left ear. Maryland CNC speech discrimination scores were recorded as 84 percent in the right ear and 86 percent in the left ear. Applying these results to TABLE VI yields a numeric designation of Level II hearing impairment in the right ear and Level III hearing impairment in the left ear. Entering Level II hearing impairment for the right ear and Level III impairment for the left ear into TABLE VII yields a noncompensable or 0 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

On the basis of the audiological evaluation of record, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss has not approximated the criteria for a compensable evaluation at any time during the appeal period. Schedular disability ratings for hearing loss are based on the results of the audiological studies of record. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992). Moreover, the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday environment as these are the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 377 (2017). The Veteran's hearing loss does not produce any other functional effects not contemplated by the rating schedule. See id. Accordingly, a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for glaucoma is remanded.

This issue is remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error, namely a favor to obtain private medical records.

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings regarding glaucoma: "Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded. You have Vietnam service from May 28, 1969 to June 3, 1969. You have been diagnosed with a disability. You were diagnosed with age-related cataracts, dry eye syndrome, and refractive error on March 25, 2019."

VA medical records include an August 2021 administrative note which indicates that the Veteran was receiving private medical treatment for his eyes. The administrative note indicates that he was seen by the Prosser Eye Care on several occasions in 2021. He was also seen by a Dr. Li for his eyes in 2020. This administrative note also indicates that he was being evaluated for "POAG," which appears to be an abbreviation for primary open angle glaucoma.  The administrative note indicated that documents were scanned into Vista Imaging Display for viewing and forwarded to the staff eye doctor for chart review. Other VA medical records throughout 2020 and 2021 reference the Veteran's treatment at the Prosser Eye Clinic.

Unfortunately, these records are not available in the record for the Board's review. Remand is required to allow VA to obtain authorization and request these records.

2. Entitlement to service connection for memory loss is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for anxiety attacks is remanded.

The Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for acid reflux, memory loss, and anxiety attacks, each as "secondary to PTSD."  See October 2023 Form 21-526EZ.

In a November 2023 letter, the AOJ informed the Veteran that as his claim for service connection for PTSD had previously been denied, he must use the proper form to file a supplemental claim for that benefit.  The Veteran has not submitted a supplemental claim for service connection for PTSD. 

[The Board notes that in the August 2008 rating decision that denied service connection for PTSD, the AOJ indicated that the Veteran's DD 214 showed no service in Vietnam or Korea.  They acknowledged however, that dental and service treatment records show he was seen at the Bien Hoa Airbase in the Republic of Vietnam in April 1969 and May 1969.  The AOJ also noted that a performance report for the period of February 29, 1969, to September 8, 1969, showed he was a Combat Skyspot Bord Operator in Southeast Asia and that he participated in several highly sensitive and special missions during that time.]

In March 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in conjunction with his instant claims seeking service connection for memory loss and anxiety.  During that examination, the Veteran reported while stationed in Vietnam he took part in Operation Menu as a member of a Radio Bomb Scoring unit. He described multiple incidents where his life was threatened and where others around him lost their lives. He reported that he survived 24 rocket attacks; these attacks took place at night and military service members would be woken by sirens and forced to take shelter.  He also reported that while deployed, he and his unit "ran 60 B52 carpet bombing missions." They reportedly were 1 of 3 top secret units and he reported that they had to "burn the notes" at the mission's end. The Veteran also described an incident that occurred on June 17th, 1969 as part of these activities; specifically, a rocket attack hit their vehicle while one member of their unit was outside.

The March 2024 VA examiner provided a diagnosis of PTSD, and listed memory loss and anxiety as among the Veteran's symptoms of that disability. The examiner opined that the Veteran's reported stressors meet Criterion A (i.e., they are adequate to support the diagnosis of PTSD); and that the stressors are related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.

Finaly, the Board observes that a recent VA toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) memo indicates the Veteran was found to have had herbicide agent exposure based on service in the Republic of Vietnam: "STRs-(06/27/2020) Pg 8 RVN service."

In light of the examination findings, the AOJ's failure to develop the issue of service connection for PTSD in conjunction with the claimed disabilities of memory loss and anxiety secondary to PTSD constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 47 (2011).

4. Entitlement to service connection for acid reflux is remanded.

Finally, the Veteran has claimed that he has acid reflux as secondary to PTSD, adjudication of the claim for service connection for acid reflux must be deferred as it is inextricably intertwined with the remanded matter.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ensure that all outstanding VA medical records pertaining to the Veteran's eye treatment in 2021, which have been scanned into Vista Imaging, are accessible in the electronic claims file for the Board's review.

2. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for all private physician(s)/facility(ies) that have treated his claimed glaucoma, to include Dr. Li, the Prosser Eye Clinic, and Prosser Eye Care. Make two requests for the authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

3. Develop the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD and thereafter readjudicate the claimed issues of entitlement to service connection for memory loss and anxiety claimed as secondary to PTSD.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
