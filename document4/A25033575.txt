DOCKET NO. 210709-171375
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed without prejudice.

FINDING OF FACT

On April 1, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran's representative that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD by the appellant (or his or her authorized representative) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the Army from May 1968 to December 1970 and from January 1971 to January 1975. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2021 rating decision. In the July 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On April 1, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

Dismissal of Claim

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD.

In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal. Specifically, in an April 1, 2025, written statement, the Veteran's representative stated the Veteran wished to withdraw the PTSD issue on appeal. The Board finds that this withdrawal is knowing and with an understanding that the appeal would not be adjudicated. Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, and the appeal is dismissed.
