REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for res cerebral aneurysm is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2014 to August 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Because the October 2022 rating decision on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (a)(1); 19.2(a).

In March 2023, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the October 2022 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for res cerebral aneurysm, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for res cerebral aneurysm is remanded.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for his res cerebral aneurysm. See January 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ. Specifically, the Veteran reported onset of headaches in service, as well with headaches after service. After having the aneurysm in 2020, his headaches became less frequent.  The Board notes that the Veteran is now service connected for migraines.

The AOJ identified the following favorable finding: (1) the Veteran has been diagnosed with res cerebral aneurysm. See October 2022 Rating Decision.

However, the Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of the Veteran's claimed disability because no VA examiner has opined on whether the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm was etiologically related to service. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal, a VA examination was not obtained to address the issue of the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm. 

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease, (3) an indication that the current disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another disability already service connected, and (4) the evidence is otherwise insufficient to adjudicate the claim. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). The third element, which requires that the evidence of record "indicate" that the claimed disability or symptoms "may be" associated with the established event, is a low threshold. Id. at 83.

The Board finds remand for an opinion under McLendon is warranted because there is competent evidence the Veteran suffered a res cerebral aneurysm in April 2020 and he contends that the migraines in service are related/precursor to his aneurysm. Accordingly, remand is necessary to correct an error on the part of the AOJ in satisfying its duties to assist the Veteran in the development of his claim. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A (a), 5103A(d)(2)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4).

There is also evidence in the record that the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm may be related to his currently service-connected migraines. See August 2022 VA Examination Report for migraines. However, the medical opinions of record do not address whether the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm was due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. Accordingly, the examiner did not address whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection for his res cerebral aneurysm on a secondary basis. Thus, this claim requires consideration of secondary entitlement to service connection. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Failure to address this theory was also a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c)(4); 20.802(a).

Thus, remanded is warranted to obtain a VA medical opinion on the issue of the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm.

Finally, while the Veteran reports experiencing a res cerebral aneurysm in April 2020, there are no medical treatment records before the Board from his April 2020 hospital treatment. In his January 2021 statement in support of claim, the Veteran indicated he underwent brain surgery, stayed in a coma for a month, and underwent a lengthy recovery process. These medical treatment records are not in the record before the Board.

Thus, remand is also warranted to obtain the Veteran's medical treatment records regarding his res cerebral aneurysm.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain the Veteran's medical treatment records concerning his treatment for res cerebral aneurysm for the period from around April 2020 to the present.

2. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm present during the period on appeal. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be provided to, and reviewed by, the clinician before rendering the opinion. It is up to the discretion of the reviewing clinician as to whether a new examination is necessary to provide an adequate opinion. 

For the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm disability, the reviewing clinician must opine on:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm was incurred in, or is otherwise related to, active service, to include whether his in-service migraines were related to his aneurysm or were a precursor is his aneurysm.  

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the res cerebral aneurysm was proximately due to his service-connected migraines;

(c.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's res cerebral aneurysm was aggravated by his service-connected migraines;

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability.

The examiner is also advised that 38 U.S.C. § 1110 allows for service connection of conditions that would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability even if the worsening of the condition occurs due to the natural progression of that condition. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (2023).

The examiner must provide separate opinions and rationales to address secondary causation and secondary aggravation. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018).

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and history. Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide an explanation for such rejection. In forming the opinion, the examiner cannot rely on the absence of medical records corroborating disability.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed must be provided. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, discuss why this is the case. In this regard, indicate whether the inability to provide a definitive opinion is due to a need for further information or because the limits of medical knowledge have been exhausted regarding the etiology of the disability at issue or because of some other reason.
