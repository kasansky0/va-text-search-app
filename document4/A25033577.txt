DOCKET NO. 221018-287090
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to include sleep disturbance is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2025 written statement, the Veteran withdrew his appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, to include sleep disturbance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of service connection for PTSD, to include sleep disturbance, by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1994 to April 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2021 rating decision of a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Veteran subsequently filed a September 2022 VA Form 10182, requesting the evidence docket.

The Board notes that PTSD was subsequently granted in a different appeal stream, in a September 2023 rating decision. In March 2025, the Veteran submitted a written statement asking that this appeal be withdrawn.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal; additionally, service connection has already been granted for the issue on appeal. Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
