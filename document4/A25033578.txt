ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service aboard the USS Constellation included trips to the Republic of Vietnam between 1965 and 1971.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer due to herbicide exposure have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a), 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 1965 to April 1971.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Following an August 2022 denial of the Veteran's claim, he requested higher-level review (HLR) in July 2023. An August 2024 rating decision after HLR again denied service connection, and this timely appeal of the denial followed.  

In the March 2025 notice of disagreement selected the Direct Review docket, which means the Board's decision must be based on evidence already of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal.  As such, in reaching this decision, the Board has considered only the evidence of record as of the original denial in August 2022.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The matter is now before the Board for consideration. 

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C § 7107(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).  

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

Generally, if a veteran serving in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, ever develops one of the diseases identified as presumptively caused by exposure to herbicide agents, that disability is automatically service connected as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(e).  That is, no evidence of actual exposure to herbicides or a causal relationship between exposure and the claimed disability is necessary. 

The Veteran has been diagnosed with a prostate cancer.  See May 2021 Greater Boston Urology Urologic Pathology Report and May 2021 Greater Boston Urology Cancer Consult. Prostate cancer is a disability presumptively caused by herbicide agents. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Therefore, if the evidence establishes he served in Vietnam during the relevant period, he is entitled to service connection.

Personnel records for the Veteran indicate that he served aboard the USS Constellation (CVA-64) from May 17, 1967, to April 5, 1971.  See April 1967 NAVPERS 601-12, Transfers and Receipts.  Unfortunately, ship locator data does not place the USS Constellation within 12 nautical miles of the offshore eligible waters, as defined in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, Public Law 116-23, while the Veteran was aboard.  See July 2022 VA Records Research Response and January 2024 VA TERA Memo. 

The Veteran's MOS is listed as "Torpedoman's Mate."  See April 1971 DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.  However, performance evaluations aboard the USS Constellation reflect that the Veteran was a "Radar Technician," and was responsible "for the maintenance, operation, testing and repair of the AN/SPC-55A Radar."    See, e.g., November 1968, May 1969, November 1969, and April 1970 NAVPERS 792, Reports of Enlisted Performance Evaluation.

As a radar technician, the Veteran contends that testing required his presence inside of a helicopter, "while the radar would track the helicopter...which when completed, we would head to Da Nang for a few beers at the [Enlisted Men's] Club...in my 4 years on the [USS Constellation], I would guess I did 4 or 5 trips for this."  See November 2021 Buddy / Lay Statement.  Unfortunately, the deck logs from the USS Constellation are not a part of the record to verify such testing or claimed trips to Da Nang.  

However, when adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  The core of this standard is the benefit of the doubt doctrine.

In making findings and rendering decisions, the Board employs a balancing test of positive and negative evidence. When they are approximately balanced or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine entitles the veteran to the benefit of the doubt, and the Board finds in the veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 131, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  

Conversely, if the Board finds the evidence tending to disprove a fact or claim predominates to the point the overall evidentiary picture is persuasively against the veteran, reasonable doubt is extinguished, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the Board finds accordingly.  See, e.g., Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Here, the Board finds the description by the Veteran of his sojourns into Vietnam are inherently plausible given the mission and positions of the USS Constellation, and his statement therefore triggers the benefit of the doubt doctrine as to the issue of his qualification for presumptive service connection.

Service connection based on exposure to herbicide agents while in Vietnam is warranted here. This appeal is granted.
