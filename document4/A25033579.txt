REMANDED

Eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from March 2013 to January 2014.  

A.S., is the Veteran's mother.  She submitted the underlying joint application with the Veteran and is interested in serving as the Primary Family Caregiver.  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a); 38 C.F.R. § 71.25.

In March 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied entitlement to benefits under PCAFC.  In January 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Eligibility for benefits under the PCAFC is remanded.

A remand is necessary to satisfy a statutory duty under 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a), the Board may remand for correction of any error by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(12).  PCAFC requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to notify individuals who submit an application for the program of decisions affecting the furnishing of assistance with notice as described within 38 U.S.C. § 5104.

Generally, notice under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) must include the following: (1) Identification of the issues adjudicated; (2) A summary of the evidence considered by VA; (3) A summary of the applicable laws and regulations; (4) Identification of findings favorable to the claimant; (5) In the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; (6) An explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and (7) If applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

Generally, the Veteran and A.S., contend that the Veteran was eligible for a Family Caregiver and his mother met the applicant requirements to serve as Primary Family Caregiver.  However, the notification of the March 2021 Centralized Eligibility and Appeals Team (CEAT) decision does not meet the criteria outlined in 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) and as directed in 38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(12).  Without adequate notice of the basis for the denial, claimants cannot make an informed decision as to whether to accept or appeal the decision nor can they know what evidence to submit to substantiate the appeal.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 252 (2007).  The March 2021 initial determination explained that the CEAT review found the Veteran did not meet the eligibility criteria for PCAFC because the evidence did not support a finding that the Veteran needed continuous personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months for activities of daily living or continuous/daily supervision, protection, or instruction, and that participation in the program was not in the Veteran's best interest, but did not provide a summary of the evidence; the applicable laws and regulations; any favorable findings or other elements that were not satisfied leading to the denial; or an explanation of how to obtain or access the evidence used in making the decision.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction must provide the Veteran with complete notice of the decision as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104.

In March 2022, after these determinations were rendered, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated 38 C.F.R. § 71.15 to the extent that the definition for a need for supervision, protection, or instruction included a single frequency requirement ("on a daily basis") and a personal safety requirement that was inconsistent with 38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(2)(C)(ii)-(iii).  Veteran Warriors, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 29 F.4th 1320, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2022).  As such, the Board remands the claim for a pre-decisional duty to assist error based on the precedential rule announced in Veteran Warriors.  VAOGCPREC 7-03 (rules announced in judicial decisions apply retroactively to all cases still open on review when the new rule is announced); Brewer v. West, 11 Vet. App. 228, 234 (1998).  Upon remand, the Veteran's eligibility should be evaluated under the correct statutory criteria for "need for supervision, protection, or instruction."  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(2)(C).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Issue a notice of the decision on the issue of entitlement to eligibility for PCAFC benefits as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104 to the Veteran, under the correct statutory criteria for "need for supervision, protection, or instruction" that is consistent with the holding in Veteran Warriors and 38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(2)(C) for the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision.  The notice shall include but is not limited to, a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; 

identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of the elements not satisfied.
