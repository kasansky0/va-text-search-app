ORDER

The September 10, 2024, decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals is vacated in part as to the rating of major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxious distress.

Entitlement to a rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The September 10, 2024, decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals did not state explicitly that an increased rating of 50 percent, but no higher, from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, was granted for the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress.

2. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms of MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, most closely approximated occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for vacatur of the September 10, 2024, Board decision as to the rating of MDD with anxious distress are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7103(c), 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1000(a).

2. The criteria for a disability rating of 50 percent, but no higher, from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, for MDD with anxious distress are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1974 to June 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an appeal from a February 2021 higher level review decision, following a May 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The February 2021 higher level review decision confirmed the May 2020 rating decision's denial of service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and continuance of a disability rating of 30 percent for the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress.

In the March 4, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

While the instant appeal was pending, the AOJ, in an August 2021 rating decision, increased the evaluation of the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress from 30 percent to 50 percent, effective September 18, 2020, the date of the intent to file which preceded the Veteran's claim for individual employability. Because the Veteran selected direct review docket, however, and the Board therefore may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 AOJ decision, the Board is unable to review the propriety of 50 percent disability rating after the record closed with the May 2020 rating decision.

In a September 2024 decision, the Board stated, as to the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for MDD with anxious distress, only that a rating in excess of 50 percent for MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, was denied. The September 2024 decision did not explicitly state that an increased rating of 50 percent, although no higher, for the period from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, had been granted although the AOJ had assigned only a 30 percent disability rating in that period.

1. The motion to vacate the September 2024 Board decision.

In January 2025, the Veteran moved to vacate the September 10, 2024, Board decision, citing the lack of clarity in the September 2024 Board decision.

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on its own motion, when a claimant has been denied due process of law or has been granted benefits based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000. For the reasons discussed below, the September 10, 2024, Board decision is vacated in part, specifically, that part addressing the rating for MDD with anxious distress.

Because the September 2024 Board decision did not state that the Board was granting an increased rating of 50 percent for the period from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, the AOJ was unable to implement the favorable decision as set out in M21-5, Chapter 7, section G.1.e. The Veteran was thus denied the due process of the implementation of the grant of an increased rating for MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000. Therefore, the motion to vacate the September 10, 2024, Board decision is granted as to that portion of the decision addressing the rating of MDD with anxious distress.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating for MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020.

The Veteran argues that his MDD with anxious distress causes occupational and social impairment warranting a 100 percent disability rating. March 2021 Notice of Disagreement; May 2021 appellate brief.

A November 2018 rating decision originally granted service connection for the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress as secondary to his left knee chondromalacia disability. The AOJ assigned a 30 percent rating effective September 21, 2018, the date of the Veteran's claim for service connection for his psychiatric disability. While this matter was pending on appeal, an August 2021 rating decision increased the Veteran's rating for his psychiatric disability to 50 percent, effective September 18, 2020, the date of the intent to file that preceded the Veteran's October 2020 claim for individual unemployability, as noted above. 

Because the Veteran selected direct review in his March 2021 notice of disagreement, the Board may not review evidence submitted after the May 22, 2020, notice of the May 2020 rating decision. Therefore, the Board may only review the propriety of an increased rating from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, the period for which the evidence in the record permits adjudication. 

As the maximum rating sought by the Veteran was not assigned from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, the Veteran's claim for an increased rating has been recharacterized accordingly.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's symptoms of his mental health disorder, in the period from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, caused a level of impairment most closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 50 percent rating. The Veteran's symptoms and functional impairment during that same period did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 70 percent or higher.

A 30 percent rating, as was assigned to the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder from September 21, 2018, to prior to September 18, 2020, is appropriate when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned for symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, which cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms reflect impairments such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, which result in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

In this matter, the October 2018 and May 2020 VA examinations and the Veteran's September 2018 private mental health examination show that the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress was manifested by symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating including flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, impaired abstract thinking, and difficulty maintaining effective work and social relationships. The Veteran also had symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as suspiciousness, fatigability, and restlessness, but are most closely approximated by the criteria for a 50 percent rating.

As to disturbances in motivation and mood, the October 2018 VA examination recorded the Veteran's mood as depressed nearly every day and also anxious, producing fatigue, feelings of self-doubt, and diminished interest in engaging in activities. Also in the October 2018 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his knee injury left him unable to perform activities as he used to do and left him feeling hopeless and helpless, as well as leaving him with a lack of motivation and a loss of enjoyment of activities he had previously enjoyed. The September 2018 private examination similarly reported depression and anxiety and also recorded flattened affect.

The September 2018 private examination likewise related the ways in which the Veteran's knee disability caused psychiatric symptoms and impacted the Veteran's functioning. The private examiner noted that, because of the Veteran's chronic pain, he became more irritable and would lose his patience and felt unmotivated to do activities. Although the private examiner also noted an intermittent inability to perform the activities of daily living, the notation appears related to the Veteran's explanation that he had to modify his dressing because of the pain related to the knee, rather than to a lack of motivation or psychological impairment. 

As to the Veteran's impaired abstract thinking, the September 2018 private examiner noted that the Veteran noticed memory issues and a lack of focus and concentration. The October 2018 VA examination also noted the Veteran's struggles to concentrate because of his worry and sense of helplessness. Additionally, in the May 2020 VA examination, the Veteran stated that he did not always "feel right" but offered no more specific explanation of the vague sense.

As to the Veteran's relationships, the October 2018 VA examination noted that, while the Veteran reported that he got along well with his current wife and socialized at church, the Veteran did not have friends outside of his church or family. See also September 2018 private examination. The May 2020 VA examination reported that the Veteran's mood was subject to sudden and unpredictable changes which affected his relationship with his wife because, as the Veteran described it, his psychiatric disability was hard on her. See also September 2018 private examination. The September 2018 private examination additionally noted that the Veteran experienced suspiciousness, became withdrawn, and isolated himself because of his chronic pain.

VA treatment records, the October 2018 and May 2020 VA examinations, and the September private examination thus reflect impairment at a level and due to symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating. They do not reflect symptoms and functional impairments associated with a 70 percent rating. Although the Veteran reported suicidal ideation in the October 2018 VA examination, he indicated that he had last had such thoughts 20 to 25 years prior the VA examination and VA treatment records include no notations of suicidal ideation or death wishes.

The Veteran's private treatment records do not include mental health assessments or private treatment other than the April 2020 private PTSD evaluation. The Veteran also provided no lay statements other than those made to the examiners in October 2018, April 2020, and May 2020. 

The April 2020 private examination fails to support a rating in excess of 50 percent. The private examiner recorded several of the same symptoms noted in the October 2018 and May 2020 VA examinations and supported by the record, including disturbances of mood such as anhedonia and difficulty in social relationships expressed by a lack of trust of others, crowd avoidance, and irritability with angry outbursts, all most closely approximating the symptoms listed with a 50 percent rating. However, the April 2020 private examination also identified symptoms unsupported by any other medical records in the claims file, including the VA examination conducted one month later in May 2020. These symptoms included intrusive thoughts, vivid recollections of service including images and sounds, and hallucinations. In the absence of support in the record for these relatively extreme symptoms that would be expected to be noted in medical records by care providers, the April 2020 private examiner's report of these symptoms and psychiatric criteria related to PTSD is simply not credible. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(7).

In summary, the credible evidence of record persuasively demonstrates that, from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress manifested in symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating such as impaired abstract thinking, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Further, in that same period, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms of fatigability and restlessness more closely approximate symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating, being less severe than those contemplated by a 70 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126. These symptoms of the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress produced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020.

The evidence of record, as described above, persuasively weighs in favor of a disability rating of 50 percent, but against a finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, resulted in the level of impairment required for a 70 percent rating. The criteria for a 70 percent or higher rating for that period, therefore, are not met. The Veteran's symptoms thus necessarily also do not produce total occupational and social impairment warranting a disability rating of 100 percent for the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020. 

For these reasons, a disability rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's MDD with anxious distress from September 21, 2018, to prior to May 22, 2020, is granted.
