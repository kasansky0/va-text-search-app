Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2019 for total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2019 for entitlement to eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. 35 is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left tarsal surgery scar is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for left knee strain is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right tarsal surgery scar is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right knee strain is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. As of January 30, 2019, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone were of sufficient severity to produce unemployability.

2. Based on the grant of an earlier effective date for a TDIU to January 30, 2019, herein, the Veteran met the basic eligibility requirements for Chapter 35 benefits as of January 30, 2019.

3. On January 30, 2019, VA received an intent to file from the Veteran. The Veteran subsequently made service connection claims for his bilateral knee strains and tarsal scars in March 2019. No communications were received by VA prior to January 30, 2019 that may be construed as a formal or informal claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Entitlement to a TDIU is warranted from January 30, 2019. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

2. From January 30, 2019, the criteria for eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 5102, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021.

3. The criteria for an earlier effective date for left tarsal surgery scar prior to January 30, 2019 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

4. The criteria for an earlier effective date for left knee strain prior to January 30, 2019 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

5. The criteria for an earlier effective date for right tarsal surgery scar prior to January 30, 2019 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

6. The criteria for an earlier effective date for right knee strain prior to January 30, 2019 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1978 to May 1981. The Board thanks the Veteran for his service.

On August 23, 2017, the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017) went into effect. This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review on or after February 19, 2019. As this case is an appeal of a March 2023 rating decision, this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework. 

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) electing direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 and January 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2019 for total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU)

2. Entitlement to an effective date of January 30, 2019 for entitlement to eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. 35

After review, the Board finds that the Veteran warrants an effective date of January 30, 2019 for his TDIU.

Total disability ratings for compensation based upon individual unemployability may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more or, as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

In evaluating entitlement to a TDIU, the central inquiry is "whether a veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." See Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

Substantially gainful employment, in the context, contains economic and noneconomic components; the economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person, while the noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). The Court also provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment, noting that attention must be given to: the veteran's occupational history, education, skill and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities. The Board's inquiry must focus on the current severity of the service-connected disabilities and whether they render the veteran unable to obtain or sustain substantially gainful employment, without consideration of the effect of non-service-connected disabilities. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019); see Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated as totally disabled.

The determination of unemployability is to be made by a VA adjudicator and is not a medical question. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 168.

The Veteran's representative states that the Veteran's claim for TDIU has remained part and parcel with his claim that was made January 30, 2019. The representative also states that the Veteran has not worked in a gainful capacity since January 2011.

The Board agrees with the assessment that the Veteran's claim for TDIU was part and parcel with his January 2019 claim.

As of January 30, 2019, the Veteran was in receipt of a combined rating of 80 percent with a 70 percent rating for his depressive disorder. As such, the Veteran qualifies for schedular TDIU from this date.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 in March 2021. The Veteran has a high school education. He last worked full time as a security control room officer in January 2011. He indicated leaving his job due to disability and did not attempt to obtain employment afterwards.

The Veteran's service-connected disorders impose significant limitations on the Veteran. A May 2019 examination indicated that the Veteran's ankle disorders limit his ability to lift, stand for prolonged periods of time, walking on flat surfaces without assistive devices, and stop him from climbing stairs or ladders, ambulating over uneven surfaces, and inhibit running and jumping. A May 2019 VA examination for his pes planus and tarsal tunnel syndrome demonstrated the same limitations.

A September 2019 neuropathy examination indicated that the Veteran's neuropathies caused no functional impact. Conversely, a September 2019 psychiatric evaluation indicated that the Veteran's depressive disorder caused chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, difficulty understanding complex commands, suicidal ideation and disturbances of mood and motivation.

In making this determination the Board has contemplated the findings of the VA medical records, VA examinations, lay statements, and any submitted private medical documents. The Board specifically notes the examinations previously discussed.

The Board concludes that an effective date of January 30, 2019 is proper. In particular, the Board cites the severity of the Veteran's major depressive disorder, bilateral feet disorders and bilateral ankle disorders, as well as the existence of other service connected disorders that impact the Veteran. The evidence clearly demonstrates that the Veteran would consistently struggle to even accomplish sedentary work.

The Board has considered whether a TDIU prior to January 30, 2019 is warranted.  After a careful and sympathetic review of the record, the Board does not find that that time period warrants extra-schedular consideration. Prior to January 30, 2019, the Veteran's combined disability rating was 20 percent. Furthermore, evidence within the claims file does not establish, that the Veteran was unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, based on the disorders that were service-connected during that time period. Finally, the Veteran has made no such assertions or statements indicating that he warrants such an entitlement.

Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities from January 30, 2019, the last day the Veteran was considered employable. Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU is warranted from January 30, 2019. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

Additionally, basic eligibility for certification of Survivors' and DEA benefits exists if a veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability.

By virtue of the decision above, the Veteran has had a permanent and total service-connected disability since January 30, 2019. Accordingly, the criteria for basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits are established from that date.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and an award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date the claim arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For claims for an increase in a service-connected disability, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," all of the evidence must be looked to, including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions, and an effective date must be assigned based on that evidence. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35-36 (2000); VAOPGCPREC 12-98. Thus, "it is the information in a medical opinion, and not the date the medical opinion [that] was provided that is relevant when assigning an effective date." Tatum v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 139, 145 (2010); see also Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

Neither the Veteran nor his representatives have put forth a specific argument as to why earlier effective dates are warranted.

The Veteran's current effective date for his bilateral knee strains, right tarsal surgery scar, and left tarsal surgery scar is January 30, 2019, the day the AOJ found that the Veteran submitted an Intent to File. The record does not contain a formal or informal claim for any disorder prior to January 30, 2019, the current effective date of service connection. There was no claim for either disorder prior to the date selected by the AOJ.

The effective date of a disorder is impacted by a variety of factors. Here, the controlling factors are the existence of the disabilities, the date the Veteran's active service ended, and the date of receipt of a claim. As such, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date for service connection for psoriasis and left knee sprain is not warranted.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims of an earlier effective date for service connection for bilateral knee strains, right tarsal surgery scar, and left tarsal surgery scar. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply and earlier effective dates are not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
