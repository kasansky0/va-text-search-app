REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1979 to April 1981.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

The Board notes that a July 2024 rating decision granted the Veteran 60 percent ratings for his right and left lower extremity peripheral vascular disease disabilities from February 22, 2023.  Consequently, the issues of entitlement to ratings in excess of 60 percent for right and left lower extremity peripheral vascular disease disabilities have been added to this decision.

In a May 2024 decision, the Board denied increased ratings for right and left lower extremity peripheral vascular disease for various time periods.  The decision also granted increased staged ratings for two time periods.  To the extent it denied increased staged ratings, the Veteran appealed the May 2024 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In a November 2024 order, the Court granted an Amended Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR).  The Court order vacated the Board's May 2024 decision to the extent that it denied increased staged ratings for right and left lower extremity peripheral vascular disease.  The Court order remanded the case to the Board for action consistent with the JMPR.

The JMPR states that the Board failed to address the arguments made in an April 2024 statement from the Veteran.  In that statement, the Veteran's attorney, citing to Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012), pointed out that the rating criteria for peripheral vascular disease does not take into consideration the effects of medication.  The attorney then noted that the (July 2017) VA examination report states that the Veteran treated his lower extremity peripheral vascular disease with medication.  He asserted that therefore the Veteran's claims should be remanded for a retrospective opinion.  

The attorney is correct that the pertinent rating criteria, 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7114, does not contemplate medication use.  As the May 2017 VA examiner did not provide any guidance as to what the Veteran's baseline lower extremity symptoms would have been but for the use of ameliorative medication, a retrospective medical opinion must be obtained to clarify as to what the severity of the lower extremity peripheral vascular symptoms would have been without the ameliorating effects of the Veteran's medications.  

The failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to correct this pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  38 C.F.R. ยง 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran a VA peripheral vascular disease examination of the lower extremities.  The examiner must provide details as to the severity of the Veteran's lower extremities in accordance with both the former (prior to November 14, 2021) and current versions of 38 C.F.R. ยง 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7114.  

Under the former version the examiner should provide specific findings as to the Veteran's ability to walk on a level grade at 2 miles per hour and specify the maximum distance the Veteran can walk before experiencing claudication.  Describe the presence and severity of diminished peripheral pulses and any indications of arterial occlusion.  Note any trophic changes such as thin skin, absence of hair, or dystrophic nails should be described if present.  The presence of pain at rest, persistent coldness of the extremities or ischemic limb pain should be described.  As the pertinent rating criteria does not contemplate medication use, the VA clinician should clarify what the severity of the lower extremity peripheral vascular symptoms would be without the ameliorating effects of the Veteran's medications, if any.

The examiner is requested to provide retrospective evaluation of the Veteran's symptoms as described in the May 2017 VA examination report, and as described by the VA treatment records since April 2017, and opine as to what the severity of the Veteran's symptoms would have been under the former criteria without the ameliorating effects of the Veteran's medications (such as Veteran's ability to walk on a level grade at 2 miles per hour and specify the maximum distance the Veteran can walk before experiencing claudication, etc.).  The same should be provided for the Veteran's symptoms under the current criteria based on treatment records dated after November 14, 2021.

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional obtainable facts are required), or (the examiner does not have the knowledge or training).
