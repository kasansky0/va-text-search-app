ORDER

The appeal of the deferment of a decision on entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a December 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) deferred a decision on entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the deferment of a decision on entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from March 1986 to June 1995. He has another period of active-duty service from June 1995 to December 1998 that has been deemed dishonorable for VA purposes.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The appeal of the deferment of a decision on entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105. 

In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ did not issue a decision for the issue of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. Rather, the AOJ deferred a decision. The issue was last adjudicated in an August 2022 rating decision, more than one year prior to receipt of the January 30, 2024 Notice of Disagreement. Thus, even after considering the Board's requirement to liberally interpret a Notice of Disagreement, see 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.202(a), there simply is no decision adjudicating service connection for sleep apnea that can be construed as having been validly appealed to the Board, and dismissal is warranted.
