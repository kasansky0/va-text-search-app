REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of ambulance services provided to the Veteran on November 26, 2020, by City of Norfolk is remanded.

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of ambulance services provided to the Veteran on February 20, 2021, by City of Norfolk is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1984 to November 1990. The Veteran passed away in May 2022.

The appellant is the provider who transported the Veteran via ambulance on November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2020 and March 2021 determinations by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2020 and March 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of ambulance services provided to the Veteran on November 26, 2020, by City of Norfolk is remanded.

2. Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of ambulance services provided to the Veteran on February 20, 2021, by City of Norfolk is remanded.

In the December 2020 and March 2021 decisions on appeal, the AOJ denied the claims for payment or reimbursement for the cost of the ambulance transportation on both November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021, based on a findings that the Veteran did not meet the criteria under 38 U.S.C. § 111; specifically, that the Veteran has a service-connected disability rating of less than 30 percent; the transports were not related to a service-connected disability; and the Veteran's annual income for the calendar year immediately preceding the dates of transport exceeds the maximum annual rate of VA pension. See 38 U.S.C. § 111(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a). Notably, the denials of the instant claims were rendered by the VAMC Beneficiary Travel Department.

However, VA beneficiary travel rules explicitly do "not cover payment for emergency transportation of veterans for non-service-connected conditions in non-VA facilities when the payment for transportation is covered by §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008, as authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1725." 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000-17.1008; 70.1.

The evidence for the November 26, 2020, date of service indicates that this claim may have involved ambulance transportation to a non-VA facility for a medical emergency. Specifically, a CAPRI record reflects that the Veteran presented to a non-VA emergency room following a fall with a closed head injury. See November 27, 2020, non-VA community care coordination note. Regarding the February 20, 2021, episode of care, there is a CAPRI record that reflects that the Veteran presented to a non-VA emergency room with complaints of chest pain. See March 31, 2021, non-VA community care coordination note. However, these two notes are snippets contained within the VHA beneficiary travel file, and it is unclear from the documentation of record the exact circumstances surrounding the ambulance transportations and the ultimate treatment that the Veteran received at the non-VA emergency rooms. Additionally, the March 2021 VA Form 10182 reflects that the appellant asserts that both dates of service and ambulance transportations were "emergency in nature." 

The December 2020 and March 2021 denial letters did not reference 38 U.S.C. § 1725 as a possible basis for receiving payment or reimbursement for the ambulance transportations, and there is no indication that any actual assessment of the Veteran's eligibility for payment or reimbursement for the ambulance transportations under this provision was performed.

As this case involves ambulance transportations to a non-VA facility in alleged emergencies, and there is no indication that these claims have been appropriately adjudicated under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.1000 through 17.1008, a remand is appropriate so that such adjudication can be completed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, indicating that remand is appropriate where correction of an error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim on appeal.

The Board also notes that evidence pertinent to this appeal has not been associated with the claims file. In this regard, the file does not include any records from the City of Norfolk pertaining to the transports of the Veteran on November 26, 2020, to Faith Regional Hospital and the transport on February 20, 2021, to the same non-VA hospital. It also does not include any records from Faith Regional Hospital pertaining to the treatment he received during or following the ER visits on November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021. Additionally, it does not include any VA treatment records from the period during which the appellant was transported by the ambulance on November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021, and thereafter, documentation that could also be pertinent to whether a medical emergency existed at the time he was transported by ambulance and whether a VA facility was available to provide treatment, two central criteria for determining whether entitlement to VA payment or reimbursement of the cost of the ambulance transportation is warranted under 38 U.S.C. § 1725. 

Consequently, on remand, such pertinent medical records should be obtained. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any available records pertinent to the claims being considered under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003 for payment or reimbursement of the cost of the ambulance transportation of the Veteran by the City of Norfolk on November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021. This documentation should include any available records of the ambulance transportations, and any subsequent records of emergency room and hospital treatment at Faith Regional Hospital pertaining to the November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021, episodes of care, as well as VA treatment records that are relevant to the dates of service. 

2. Appropriately adjudicate the claims for payment or reimbursement of the cost of the ambulance transportation of the Veteran by the City of Norfolk on November 26, 2020, and February 20, 2021, under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and the accompanying regulations, particularly 38 C.F.R. § 17.1003, ensuring that the decision issued to the Appellant complies with the notice requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104.
