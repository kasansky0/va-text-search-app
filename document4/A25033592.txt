REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical expenses incurred from December 6, 2016 through December 10, 2016, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2008 to November 2016.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2020 VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Community Care (OCC) letter.  That letter explains that previous denials for payment or reimbursement of medical expenses are appealable under the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in Wolfe v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 1 (2019).  The letter also notes that the Veteran may have been impacted by VA's erroneous statement of the law and explains that his appeal period has re-started and he has one year from May 2020 to file an appeal.

On November 9, 2020, VA received a VA Form 10182.  The Veteran selected the Direct Review lane and expressed disagreement with a purported November 2, 2017 decision; in an attachment he also cited to the May 2020 VA letter.  Therefore, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the May 2020 VHA letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

For the sake of clarity, under the Direct Review option, the Board may not consider evidence that accumulated after the May 2020 letter (more precisely, the evidence which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) considered in the decision).  See Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  

The Board notes that evidence (including non-VA treatment records and a non-VA billing patient statement of account) was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed (after the May 2020 letter) under the Direct Review docket.  As the Board is remanding the claim for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical expenses incurred from December 6, 2016 through December 10, 2016.

Remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist omissions.

Based on the limited record before the Board, it appears the Veteran seeks reimbursement for the cost of emergent, non-VA medical treatment for a service-connected disability from December 6 through December 10, 2016.  Specifically, attached to his November 2020 VA Form 10182, the Veteran included a statement (on a VA Form 9, dated in November 2018) that he disagrees with the denial of coverage for an emergent hospitalization for service-connected kidney failure; he reports that VA facilities were not feasibly available.  [The record shows the Veteran has established service connection for status post kidney failure, effective November 3, 2016.  See October 2017 rating decision.]  

The evidence currently of record is somewhat sparse.  The record contains a December 14, 2016 follow-up treatment record from University of Tennessee (UT) Internal Medicine.  However, complete records of treatment at UT do not appear to have been sought.  Such records may help to substantiate the claim, particularly under 38 U.S.C. § 1728.  Therefore, remand is necessary to obtain complete treatment records from UT.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  [The Board acknowledges additional records from UT were received in February 2021; however, as explained above, the Board is unable to review and consider that evidence under the Direct Review docket.  Failure to obtain (or seek to obtain) such records prior to the decision on appeal constitutes a duty to assist omission.]  

Notably, a November 8, 2018 VHA letter denied the claim seeking reimbursement for the cost of medical expenses incurred at the University of Tennessee Medical Center from December 7, 2016 through December 9, 2016 on the basis that services were not authorized under VA contract, language which suggests consideration under 38 U.S.C. § 1703.  Although the decision lists the "Fee Program" as 38 U.S.C. § 1728, it does not appear such regulation was fully considered in the rationale provided.  

As correction of these errors by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the medical reimbursement claim on appeal, the appeal must be remanded for the AOJ to associate such pertinent records with the file, properly adjudicate the Veteran's claim under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 and 38 U.S.C. § 1728, and provide appropriate notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) to the Veteran and his representative.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask the Veteran to submit an authorization for VA to secure for the record complete clinical records from the University of Tennessee Medical Center for treatment provided from December 6, 2019 through December 10, 2019.  If he does so, obtain those records.

2. Thereafter, adjudicate the claim of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the cost of non-VA medical expenses incurred from December 6, 2016 through December 10, 2016, under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725 and 1728.  The decision must address the Veteran's contention that the treatment was emergent for a service-connected disability. 

3. Provide appropriate notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b) to the Veteran and his representative.
