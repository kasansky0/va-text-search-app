FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The January 2023 rating decision granting service connection for prostate cancer, effective August 10, 2022, was not properly appealed and became final.

2. The Veteran's request for an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for prostate cancer constitutes a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.

3. The September 1981 Board decision confirming the Veteran's effective date of September 18, 1978, for the award of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis was not properly appealed and became final.

4. The Veteran's request for an effective date prior to September 18, 1978, for the award of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis constitutes a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim.

5. The February 2019 rating decision granting service connection for left knee instability, effective November 20, 2018, was not properly appealed and became final.

6. The Veteran's request for an effective date prior to November 20, 2018, for the award of service connection for left knee instability constitutes a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim. 

7. Prior to August 10, 2022, there was no pending, unadjudicated claim or unadjudicated petition to reopen the claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction secondary to prostate cancer.

8. The Veteran's award of SMC based on the loss of use of a creative organ is predicated on the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction, which, pursuant to the June 2023 rating decision, has an effective date of August 10, 2022.

9. The discontinuance of the 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer, effective June 1, 2024, was not a formal rating reduction, but a change in rating assignment by operation of law in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7528. The procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) were appropriately followed in this case. The Veteran's prostate cancer was in remission and without continued malignancy at the time of the June 1, 2024, rating reduction.

10. During the period under review, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran experienced residuals of prostate cancer in the form of voiding dysfunction with 3 awakenings to void per night. 

11. The diagnostic code only provides a noncompensable rating for the service-connection of erectile dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for prostate cancer, lacks legal merit and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

2. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date earlier than September 18, 1978, for the award of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis, lacks legal merit and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

3. The Veteran's freestanding claim seeking an effective date earlier than November 20, 2018, for the award of service connection for left knee instability, lacks legal merit and is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 5109A; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). 

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.104, 3.155, 3.156, 3.159, 3.400.

5. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.104, 3.155, 3.156, 3.159, 3.400.

6. The criteria for the reduction of the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer, effective June 1, 2024, was proper. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 4.115b, DC 7528.

7.  The criteria for a 20 percent rating, but no higher, for residuals of prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.115a, 4.115b, DC 7528.

8. The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for erectile dysfunction have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.115b, DC 7522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1972 to March 1974.

The issue comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from June 2023, September 2023, October 2023, and March 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023, September 2023, October 2023, and March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for acid reflux and increased ratings for left knee disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection for a disease or injury is the day following separation from active duty or the date entitlement arose if VA received a claim within one year after separation from service. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date the claim was received or the date the entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id. In other words, as dictated by the above provisions, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection for the disability addressed in that decision is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Id.

Under former regulations pertaining to legacy appeals, prior to February 19, 2019, a rating decision becomes final and binding if the Veteran does not timely perfect an appeal of the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.1103. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim after notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. After a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

The Court has emphasized that an effective date cannot be challenged with a freestanding earlier effective date claim. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). Rather, once a rating decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only basis for challenging the effective date is a motion to revise the decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.160; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. 296 at 299.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its rules as to what constitutes a claim for benefits; claims are now required to be submitted on a specific claim form, prescribed by the Secretary, and available online or at the local regional office (RO). Prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized formal and informal claims. In this regard, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who cannot act on his own behalf may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the PACT Act of 2022. Notably, the section of the PACT Act titled "Veterans Agent Orange Exposure Equity Act of 2022" expanded the presumption of in-service herbicide agent exposure to service in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, American Samoa, and Johnston Atoll. Pub. L. 117-168 § 403; 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (d).

The PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168 § 403, amended 38 U.S.C. § 1116 by adding locations in addition to the Republic of Vietnam where a veteran's service during specified periods will be presumed to have exposed him or her to herbicide agents, otherwise called "covered service." Such covered service includes active service performed in or on Thailand at any U.S. or Royal Thai base from January 9, 1962, to June 30, 1976, without regard to where on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the veteran performed. Additionally, the earliest effective date assignable for grants of benefits based on the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1784. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for prostate cancer

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for his grant of service connection for prostate cancer. Specifically, he contends that his award for service connection should extend back to 1993. See March 2024 10182. 

The Veteran's freestanding earlier effective date claim related to the grant of service connection for prostate cancer is improper.

In the January 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for prostate cancer associated with herbicide exposure, and granted a 100 percent evaluation effective August 10, 2022, as the Veteran's claim for service connection was within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act, and the grant of service connection is based on presumptive service connection provided in the PACT Act. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. Accordingly, as the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer was granted in accordance with the new rules afforded in the PACT Act, the earliest available effective date possible is August 10, 2022.

Then, in accordance with the diagnostic code (DC) for prostate cancer, the RO gave him a VA examination and proposed that his rating be decreased to 20 percent in the June 2023 rating decision. However, in a September 2023 rating decision, the RO then proposed the award be decreased it from 20 percent to 10 percent; so, the Veteran was never officially decreased to 20 percent. Thereafter, the RO reduced the Veteran's evaluation to 10 percent in a December 2023 rating decision, effective March 1, 2024, pursuant to the DC. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528. However, the RO issued another rating decision in March 2024, decreasing the Veteran's award to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024, pursuant to the DC. Id. 

On March 18, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for prostate cancer to 1993. However, the March 18, 2024, VA Form 10182 was not timely as to the January 2023 rating decision granting service connection, nor did the Veteran timely file any of the other review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the January 2023 rating decision.

Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his representative, must file a NOD or one of the other review options in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) with a determination by the AOJ within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination. Otherwise, that determination will become final. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52 (a). Notably, VA sent the notice of the grant of service connection for prostate cancer on January 18, 2023. Accordingly, the Veteran did not have continual pursuit of the January 2023 rating decision, and it became final. Id. 

Once a rating decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains CUE. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300 (holding that any other result with vitiate the rule of finality); DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no procedure for filing a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision).

In other words, if there is disagreement as to the effective date assigned in a given rating action, it must be timely appealed or otherwise continuously pursued within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date. In cases where this is not done, only a finding of CUE in an unappealed, final decision would yield an earlier effective date. In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any instances of CUE in the January 2023 rating decision and is therefore not seeking an earlier effective date on the basis of CUE.

To the extent that the Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for prostate cancer on any basis other than CUE, such a claim is precluded. As freestanding earlier effective claims are barred as a matter of law, the claim for an earlier effective date must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 18, 1978, for the award of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis with meniscal tear 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 20, 2018, for the award of service connection for left knee instability 

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for his grants of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis and instability. 

The Veteran's freestanding earlier effective date claims related to the grants of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis and instability are improper.

The AOJ granted service connection for a left knee injury (later left knee osteoarthritis) in November 1979, with an effective date of September 18, 1978. The Veteran appealed the matter of the effective date and rating to the Board, which were denied in a September 1981 Board decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor did he submit new and material evidence within the one-year period. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b).

Regarding left knee instability, the Veteran was granted service connection in a February 2019 rating decision, with an effective date of November 20, 2018. The rating decision granting the effective date was not properly appealed, nor was new and material evidence submitted within one year, and the decision became final. 

Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his representative, must file a NOD with a determination by the AOJ within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination. Otherwise, that determination will become final. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52 (a). Notably, VA sent the notice statement of case on August 20, 2019. Accordingly, the decision was not substantively appealed and became final. Id. 

Once a rating decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains CUE. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300 (holding that any other result with vitiate the rule of finality); DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no procedure for filing a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision).

In other words, if there is disagreement as to the effective date assigned in a given rating action, it must be timely appealed within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date. In cases where this is not done, only a finding of CUE in an unappealed, final decision would yield an earlier effective date. In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any instances of CUE and is therefore not seeking earlier effective dates on the basis of CUE.

To the extent that the Veteran is seeking earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for left knee osteoarthritis and instability on any basis other than CUE, such claims are precluded. As freestanding earlier effective claims are barred as a matter of law, the claims for an earlier effective date must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296.

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction 

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 16, 2023, for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction 

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the grant of service connection for his erectile dysfunction and the award of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction. Specifically, the Veteran asserts the effective dates should extend back to 1993. See March 2024 10182.

The AOJ assigned August 10, 2022, as the effective date of service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to service-connected prostate cancer. 

Procedurally, in a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for prostate cancer associated with herbicide exposure, and awarded a 100 percent evaluation effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act. The RO then provided the Veteran with another VA examination in February 2023 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528, and proposed for the Veteran's evaluation to be reduced to 20 percent in a June 2023 rating decision. Thereafter, in September 2023, the RO issued another rating decision in proposing a rating reduction to 10 percent. On December 12, 2023, the RO reduced the Veteran's rating from 100 percent to 10 percent, effective March 1, 2024. The RO also issued another rating decision in March 2024, decreasing the Veteran's award to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024.

The June 2023 rating decision also granted service connection for erectile dysfunction secondary to the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer pursuant to the PACT Act, effective August 10, 2022, as well as SMC for loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction, effective February 16, 2023, the date of the February 2023 VA examination.

As the Veteran's service connection award for prostate cancer maintains an effective date of August 10, 2022, pursuant to the PACT Act, the effective date of erectile dysfunction secondary to prostate cancer cannot be earlier than the effective date of service connection for prostate cancer. For awards of secondary service connection, the effective date can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis. See Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145 (2007) (holding that "as with any other claim, the effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected condition is governed by § 3.400.").

Therefore, it follows that an effective date for secondary service connection cannot be earlier than the effective date warranted for the underlying disability upon which service connection was granted because entitlement to secondary service connection does not arise until the underlying disability is service connected. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the earliest possible effective date for service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to prostate cancer is August 10, 2022.

The Board observes that SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ is bound to the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction. Thus, as the Veteran's grant of service connection for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is effective August 10, 2022, the evidence of record warrants a grant of an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.320, 3.400, 3.2500. 

Thus, the criteria for an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction have not been met; however, the criteria for an effective date earlier than February 16, 2023, for the award of SMC for loss of a creative organ have been met, and an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, is granted. Pub. L. 117-168, Title IV, § 403(e); 136 Stat. 1784; 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

Rating Reduction 

6. A reduction of the 100 percent disability rating for service-connected prostate cancer, effective June 1, 2024, was proper.

The Veteran contends that the reduction of the evaluation for prostate cancer from 100 percent disabling to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024, was improper.

The Veteran's prostate cancer was rated DC 7528, 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b. The Board notes that the criteria for evaluating genitourinary system disabilities were amended, effective November 14, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 54081 (Sept. 30, 2021). Therefore, as the amendments occurred prior to the review period for prostate cancer, they are applicable to the instant appeal. 

Under DC 7528, malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system are evaluated as 100 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528. A note to this provision indicates that following the cessation of surgical, x-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent will continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of 6 months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of § 3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. Id.

The phrase "the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure," in 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528, refers to the cessation of treatment for the applicable malignant neoplasm of the genitourinary system. Thus, the 100 percent rating will end as of the date the veteran received final treatment for cancer, the cessation of treatment for the cancer itself, as opposed to treatment for residuals secondary to the cancer or further treatment required as a result of the treatment for the disease. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 443, 447-48 (2014) (also referred to as "Tatum II").

The rating reduction provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.343 and 3.344 are not applicable in the present case. See Love v. McDonough, 106 F.4th 1361, 1368-70 (Fed. Cir. 2024); Foster v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 338, 345-46 (2021). Here, the discontinuance of the 100 percent disability rating for service-connected prostate cancer was accomplished pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528. In that regard, DC 7528 contains a temporal element for continuance of a 100 percent rating for prostate cancer or its residuals. Therefore, the action taken by the RO was not a "rating reduction," as that term is commonly understood. See Foster, 34 Vet. App. at 345-46. Rather, the rating reduction in this case was procedural in nature and by operation of law. The only requirement is that once the appropriate examination shows cancer remission, any change in the disability rating is subject to the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). A reduction implemented pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) requires a 60-day notice before VA reduces an evaluation and an additional 60-day notice before the reduced evaluation takes effect.

By way of background, in a January 17, 2023, rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for prostate cancer associated with herbicide exposure, and awarded a 100 percent evaluation, effective August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act. The RO then provided the Veteran with another VA examination in February 2023 pursuant to DC 7528, and proposed for the Veteran's evaluation to be reduced to 20 percent in a rating decision dated June 16, 2023. Thereafter, in a rating decision dated September 27, 2023, the RO issued another rating decision stating that the prior June 2023 proposal to reduce the rating to 20 percent was made in error, and proposed a rating reduction to 10 percent. In the decision, the RO stated that the Veteran had 60 days to furnish any evidence or a rebuttal. On December 12, 2023, the RO reduced the Veteran's rating from 100 percent to 10 percent, effective March 1, 2024. Then again, the RO issued a March 2024 rating decision reducing the Veteran's rating to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024. The practical effect of the rating decisions is that the Veteran's disability rating for prostate cancer was reduced from 100 percent to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024, with no intermediate rating of 20 percent.

The Veteran provided a lay statement in August 2023, indicating that his nighttime awakenings to urinate had increased from once per night to 3 times a night, that he experienced slow urination 1 to 2 times per week, as well as symptoms of arousal dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. 

The Veteran underwent a VA prostate examination in September 2023. The Veteran's malignancy was noted as being in remission, with treatment completed, and radiation therapy completed in April 2021. The examiner found that the Veteran did not have renal dysfunction. However, the Veteran was found to experience voiding dysfunction, in the form of increased urinary frequency, with daytime voiding intervals between 2 and 3 hours, and nighttime awakening to void 2 times. He was also found to experience slow stream and erectile dysfunction. 

Regarding the issue of the effective date of the reduction, it appears that the RO complied with the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). The reduction was made effective no sooner than permitted by current law and regulations ("the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final action expires"). 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). Specifically, the RO first notified the Veteran of its proposal to reduce his rating to 20 percent in a June 16, 2023, rating decision, which was sent in a June 21, 2023, notification letter, in which the Veteran was notified of his due process rights to provide any additional evidence or rebuttal before the reduction was made. The Veteran submitted the aforementioned August 2023 lay statement regarding his residuals. 

Then, the Veteran was notified of a proposed reduction in the September 27, 2023, rating decision and a September 28, 2023, notification letter, in which the Veteran was notified of his due process rights to provide any additional evidence or rebuttal before the reduction was made. The Veteran did not submit any additional evidence or rebuttal. On December 12, 2023, more than 60 days after the September 2023 rating decision, the RO issued its rating reduction to 10 percent, effective March 1, 2024, again more than 60 days after the issuance of the rating decision. Thereafter, the RO issued another rating decision on March 1, 2024, more than 60 days after the September 2023 rating decision, reducing the rating to 10 percent, effective June 1, 2024, again more than 60 days after the issuance of the rating decision.

In his August 2023 lay statement, the Veteran attested to awakening twice or three times per night to void, and slow urination once or twice per week. The September 2023 VA examination similarly reflected the Veteran's prostate cancer to be in remission, with daytime voiding intervals between 2 and 3 hours, and 2 nighttime awakening, and slow stream. This evidence did not show continued malignancy of the prostate. The Veteran did not request a personal hearing within 30 days of the June 2023 or September 2023 notice letters. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (i). More than 60 days passed before the RO issued a rating decision implementing a rating reduction.

The evidence shows that the Veteran's prostate cancer had been in remission for years by the time of the September 2023 VA examination, and the Veteran completed his prostate cancer treatment in April 2021. The procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) were followed. As the evidence reflected no local reoccurrence or metastasis of prostate cancer, the 100 percent evaluation for prostate cancer was properly reduced. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528; Foster, 34 Vet. App. At 344-49. The issue of an increased rating for the Veteran's prostate cancer following the reduction of his 100 percent rating shall be addressed in a separate section within this decision.

Increased Ratings

VA has adopted the Schedule for Rating Disabilities to evaluate service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.321; see, generally, 38 C.F.R. Part IV. The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

The degrees of disabilities are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate DCs identify the various percentage ratings for each disability and the criteria for specific ratings. However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Where there is a question of which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability assessment more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations, to the extent the evidence shows distinct time periods where the service-connected disability has exhibited signs or symptoms that would warrant different ratings under the rating criteria. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In initial-rating cases, where the appeal stems from a granted claim of service connection with respect to the initial evaluation assigned, VA assesses the level of disability from the effective date of service connection. See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126. In increased-rating claims, where a claimant seeks a higher evaluation for a previously service-connected disability, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). In such claims, VA considers the level of disability for the period beginning one year prior to the claim for a higher rating. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the probative evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); (holding that a Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an "approximate balance of positive and negative evidence" in order to prevail); 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

7. Evaluation to a rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for prostate cancer residuals

The Veteran contends that a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted for his service-connected residuals of prostate cancer.  

DC 7528 compensates for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. A 100 percent rating is assigned for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. Following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). If there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, for renal dysfunction, a 100 percent rating is warranted for chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient. An 80 percent rating is warranted for chronic kidney disease with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A 60 percent rating is warranted chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for chronic kidney disease with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. A 0 percent rating is warranted for GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

Note: GFR, estimates GFR (eGFR), and creatinine-based approximations of GFR will be accepted for evaluation purposes under this section when determined to be appropriate and calculated by a medical professional.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, voiding dysfunction is rated based on urine leakage, frequency, or obstructive voiding. Voiding dysfunction involves ratings ranging from 20 to 60 percent and contemplates continual urine leakage, post-surgical urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, or stress incontinence. A 60 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be change more than 4 times per day. A 40 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day. A 20 percent rating is warranted for voiding dysfunction requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 times per day.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, for urinary frequency, a 40 percent rating is warranted for urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval less than one hour or awakening to void five or more times per night. A 20 percent rating is warranted for urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night. A 10 percent rating is warranted for urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or awakening to void two times per night.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, for obstructed voiding, a 30 percent rating is warranted for obstructive voiding with urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization. A 10 percent rating is warranted for obstructive voiding with marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) Post void residuals greater than 150 cc. (2) Uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc/sec). (3) Recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction. (4) Stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months. A 0 (zero) percent rating is warranted for obstructive voiding with obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilatation 1 to 2 times per year.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, for urinary tract infection, a 30 percent rating is warranted for urinary tract infection with recurrent symptomatic infection requiring drainage by stent or nephrostomy tube; or requiring greater than 2 hospitalizations per year; or requiring continuous intensive management. A 10 percent rating is warranted for recurrent symptomatic infection requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer. A 0 percent rating is warranted for recurrent symptomatic infection requiring hospitalization but requiring suppressive drug therapy for less than 6 months. For poor renal function: rate as renal dysfunction.

The Veteran provided a lay statement in August 2023, indicating that his nighttime awakenings to urinate had increased from once per night to 3 times a night, that he experiences slow urination 1 to 2 times per week, as well as symptoms of arousal dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. 

The Veteran underwent a VA prostate examination in September 2023. The Veteran's malignancy was noted as being in remission, with treatment completed, and radiation therapy completed in April 2021. The examiner found that the Veteran did not have renal dysfunction. However, the Veteran was found to experience voiding dysfunction, in the form of increased urinary frequency, with daytime voiding intervals between 2 and 3 hours, and nighttime awakening to void 2 times. He was also found to experience slow stream obstructed voiding and erectile dysfunction. No urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization was found. The Veteran was noted not to experience urine leakage, have a history of urinary tract infections, or use an appliance.

Throughout the period on appeal, as outlined above, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted. Based on the September 2023 VA examiner's findings and the Veteran's August 2023 lay statement, the Veteran's primary residual of prostate cancer is voiding dysfunction manifested by urinary frequency. No renal dysfunction has been shown in the record. 

Although the September 2023 VA examination found the Veteran to experience daytime voiding intervals between 2 and 3 hours, and nighttime awakening to void 2 times per night, the Veteran reported that his nighttime awakenings to urinate increased from 1 time to 3 times per night. Regarding the Veteran's August 2023 lay statements of 3 awakenings per night and the September 2023 VA examination's findings of 2 awakenings per night, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also, Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Board finds the August 2023 lay statement to be credible and the September 2023 VA examination to be adequate, and finds in benefit of the Veteran.

The Board notes that other DCs 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a were considered, but no absorbent material usage, urinary tract infections, or urine retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization has been reflected anywhere in the record.

Thus, resolving the evidence of record in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran's residuals of prostate cancer warrant a rating of 20 percent, for the entire period on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7528. 

8. Evaluation to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction 

The Veteran contends that a compensable rating for his service-connected erectile dysfunction is warranted. 

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522.

The rating criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522 were revised, effective November 14, 2021. Under the revised rating criteria since November 14, 2021, a noncompensable rating is given for erectile dysfunction, with or without penile deformity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b. The criteria prior to November 14, 2021, may not be considered in this case as the revisions occurred prior to the period on appeal. 

DC 7522 directs that entitlement to SMC under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 shall also be considered. The Board notes that the Veteran has already been awarded SMC in a June 2023 rating decision, which has been awarded an earlier effective date within this Board decision. 

The Board has considered all potentially applicable provisions of the rating schedule, whether or not they have been raised by the Veteran or the record. However, the Board has found no DC that provides a basis upon which to assign a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction. While the Veteran has a zero percent rating, he is in receipt of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ, and he is in receipt of a monthly monetary benefit for this disability (erectile dysfunction). Therefore, he is compensated for this disability.

Thus, the evidence of record does not support a grant of a compensable rating for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction, and to this extent, the Veteran's claim is denied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522. Accordingly, the Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against an increased initial rating for the Veteran's erectile dysfunction, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for acid reflux 

The Veteran contends that his current acid reflux is due to his active-duty service, to include as due to toxic exposure.

Based on a sympathetic assessment of a veteran's claim, the Board may recharacterize an issue on appeal, or expand or restrict the scope of a particular claim to ensure the veteran is compensated for the full benefit sought. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011); see Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009); see also, Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009). Turning to the evidence, the Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for acid reflux. See October 2023 claim. The record reflects that the Veteran has a history and previous diagnoses of esophageal reflux, chronic inflammation secondary to GERD, gastritis, heartburn, and chronic constipation. See VA treatment records. Therefore, the Board will consider service connection for acid reflux, to include esophageal reflux, chronic inflammation, GERD, gastritis, heartburn, and chronic constipation. 

VA must consider all theories of entitlement either expressly raised by the claimant or which are reasonably raised by the record. Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2009). VA's duty to assist applies to the entire claim, which includes assistance in developing more than one theory in support of that claim. See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Further, based on a sympathetic assessment of the Veteran's claim, the Board may recharacterize an issue on appeal, or expand or restrict the scope of a particular claim to ensure the veteran is compensated for the full benefit sought. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011); see also, Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009).

VA's duty to assist includes providing an examination and obtaining a medical opinion when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. Such development is necessary if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but (1) contains competent evidence of a diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability, (2) establishes that the Veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in service, or has a presumptive disease during the pertinent presumptive period, and (3) indicates that the claimed disability may be associated with the in-service event, injury, or disease, or with another service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); see also, McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The threshold for finding a link between a current disability and service so as to require medical examination is low. Locklear v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 410 (2006).

The Veteran contends that his conditions have been the result of herbicide agent exposure experienced in service. See October 2023 claim. Currently chronic inflammation, GERD, gastritis, heartburn, and chronic constipation are not listed as presumptive diseases entitled to service connection due to herbicide exposure. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). The availability of presumptive service connection for a disability based on exposure to herbicides does not preclude a veteran from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation, or on any other recognized basis. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed Cir. 1994). 

In its October 2023 decision, the RO issued a favorable finding as to the Veteran's diagnosis of esophageal reflux. See October 2023 rating decision. As the Board is bound by these favorable findings, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability, satisfying the first element in McLendon. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c); see also, McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79.

The record reflects that the Veteran has reported gastrointestinal and reflux symptoms. Specifically, in the January 2005 VA treatment record, the Veteran stated that he had experienced daily heartburn for many years. Further, the Board finds that the Veteran contended that he had an in-service event that is connected to his current acid reflux. See October 2023 claim. Thus, this satisfies the second and third McLendon elements. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79.

Therefore, in consideration of the low bar set in McLendon, the Board finds that the RO committed a duty to assist error when it did not offer the Veteran a VA examination addressing the theory of service connection for his acid reflux. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79.

Absent an adequate medical opinion addressing the causal nexus between the Veteran's service and his acid reflux, the record is insufficient for the Board to decide the Veteran's claim, and a remand is needed.

Additionally, the Board must consider all theories of entitlement either expressly raised by the claimant or which are reasonably raised by the record. See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Congress passed, and the President signed, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act). The PACT Act provides that a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) medical examination/opinion is required in cases of toxic-exposed Veterans where there is a claim for a disability that is not clearly due to an etiology not associated with toxic exposure, and the claim cannot otherwise be granted based on the current evidence of record. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (38); 1168, 1710(e)(1). A Veteran can establish participation in a TERA explicitly or implicitly through service in a location presumed associated with toxic exposure, through records showing participation in a TERA, where VA has conceded exposure in a prior claim or file has a claim attribute for toxic exposure, where a Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) is associated with toxic exposure, where medical records suggest exposure to a toxic substance, chemical, or airborne hazard such as VHA exposure screening, or based on any other relevant evidence of record. 

The PACT Act provides that a TERA examination with a medical opinion is required in cases of covered veterans where there is a claim for a disability that is not clearly due to an etiology not associated with toxic exposure (such as in cases of physical trauma or mental disorders), and the evidence is not otherwise sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119; 1168(a).

The Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

The sub-regulatory guidance defines four exceptions to the requirement to obtain a TERA examination and medical opinion: physical trauma, mental disorders, disabilities that have not been shown to have any positive association with herbicide agent exposure, and disabilities that manifested during service or with a clear etiology that is not associated with toxic exposure (to include due to post-service events). VBA Letter 20-22-10, 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022). In this case, although the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, sub-regulatory guidance provides that gastrointestinal, metabolic, and digestive disorders are determined to have no positive association with herbicide agent exposure. Id. However, the record also reflects that the Veteran has also participated in other TERA, such as diesel fuel, while completing duties under his military occupational specialty (MOS) as a motor transport operator. Examination administered by the RO would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim based on statutory duty under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a), and as such, the Board finds that remand for a TERA-specific examination is required under the PACT Act.

Therefore, a remand is needed to provide the Veteran with a VA examination and a TERA-specific examination for his claim for service connection for acid reflux. 

2. Evaluation of left knee instability, which is currently 30 percent disabling

3. Evaluation of left knee osteoarthritis with meniscal tear, which is currently 10 percent disabling

The Veteran contends that the symptoms of his service-connected left knee disabilities warrant increased disability evaluations.

In September 2023, the Veteran underwent an in-person VA examination addressing his left knee conditions. The examiner found that the Veteran had left knee instability and left knee osteoarthritis with meniscal tear. The Veteran reported "constant knee pain, rated 7/10, described as sharp, lasting at least 2 hours or more, excruciating at times" with swelling and instability. He reported taking over-the-counter medication and gel joint injections. He stated he was able to walk approximately 100 yards before developing moderate to severe pain. 

The examiner found that the Veteran did not report flare-ups, but found functional loss which reduced range of motion and endurance. The Veteran had a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee. 

The Veteran was able to perform range of motion (ROM) testing for the left knee, and the examiner reported the Veteran's ROM as abnormal. During active ROM, the Veteran's left knee flexion was to 120 degrees and extension to 10 degrees. For passive range of motion, his left knee flexion was to 130 degrees, and extension to 5 degrees. The examiner noted pain on both flexion and extension for active and passive ROM exhibited pain and caused functional loss. No range of motion testing was provided in the right knee throughout the examination. 

The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing in his left knee with at least three repetitions with no additional functional loss or ROM found. The Veteran was not examined immediately after repetitive use over time testing for his left knee, but the examiner found pain, weakness and lack of endurance which significantly limited functional ability. The estimated ROM for the left knee for repeated use over time was flexion to 120 degrees and extension to 10 degrees.  The examiner did not provide ROM estimates or data for flare-ups.

No muscle atrophy or ankylosis was found, with no patellar instability. Recurrent subluxation or persistent instability was noted. A prior meniscal tear was noted. The Veteran did not use assistive devices. 

The Board finds the September 2023 VA examination of the knees is inadequate and thus constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error on the part of the AOJ; therefore, remand for an adequate examination is warranted.

Specifically, the Board finds that the September 2023 VA examiner provided an inadequate opinion regarding flare-ups. Although the examiner noted that the Veteran did not experience flare-ups, the Veteran reported "constant knee pain" as well as pain "lasting at least 2 hours or more" that was "excruciating at times." See September 2023 VA examination. The Board finds this to be indicia of the Veteran experiencing flare-ups. The examiner failed to consider the Veteran's prior lay statements regarding flare-ups and did not provide ROM estimates for the flare-ups. When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). For these reasons, to that extent, the Board finds the September 2023 medical opinion to be inadequate. 

Next, the Board notes that the rating criteria for assessing the severity of knee disabilities do not specifically contemplate the use of medication to ameliorate symptoms. Thus, in assigning a rating, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012) (the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that "[a]bsent a clear statement [in the diagnostic code] setting out whether or how the Board should address the effects of medication... the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher disability rating on the basis of relief provided by medication."); see also Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet.App. __, __, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, 2025 WL 779556 (Mar. 12, 2025) (noting that to comply with the holding of Jones (David J.) v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), where a relevant Diagnostic Code does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability). In the examination, the Veteran stated he managed his symptoms with over-the-counter medication and gel joint injections. In fact, the Veteran has reported that the injections have provided "significant relief." See September 2023 VA treatment record. It is unclear if the September 2023 VA examiner implicitly considered the ameliorative effects of medication in evaluating the Veteran's symptoms of his left knee disability. As such, the Board finds another medical opinion that explicitly disregards the ameliorative effects of medication in assessing the severity of his service-connected left knee disability is required.

Accordingly, remand is required to provide further development addressing the severity of the Veteran's left knee condition.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to determine the etiology of the Veteran's claimed acid reflux. The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner. The examination may be conducted via telehealth or similar service. Any indicated tests and studies must be accomplished, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail, and correlated to a specific diagnosis.

Following a review of the evidence of record, the examiner must opine as to whether:

(a) it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's acid reflux had its onset during, or is otherwise etiologically related to, active-duty service.

(b) it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's acid reflux is due to in-service associated toxic exposure. Under the PACT Act, as stated above, the Veteran has established military service that qualifies for a presumption of environmental exposure, and the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and service and conduct a synergistic and combined effect analysis of all toxic exposure risk activities that may provide a basis to service connect the claimed disability.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including a clearly stated rationale for any opinions offered and conclusions reached, citing the objective medical findings leading to the conclusions, and must not be based solely on the lack of records. In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such statements by the Veteran regarding symptomatology and medical history must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions concerning the onset and severity of his disability. If such reports are rejected by the examiner, a reason for doing so must be provided.

A clear rationale for all opinions must be provided and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved should be included. 

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to assess the severity of his service-connected left knee disability. The examiner should be given access to the entire claims file and should note review of it prior to issuing an opinion. All indicated tests and studies should be performed. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.

The examiner must also attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups and repeated use over time. To the extent possible, the examiner should identify any symptoms and functional impairments due to his service-connected left knee disability and discuss the effect of the Veteran's disability on any occupational functioning and activities of daily living. To the extent possible, the examiner should also estimate the left knee disability's severity without considering the ameliorative effects of medication, to include over-the-counter pain medication, gel joint injections, etc.

If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement, or an opinion regarding flare-ups or with repeated use over time, to include symptoms, or functional impairment without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

The examiner must address the Veteran's inability to perform ROM testing due to pain; and consideration must be given to the Veteran's knee disabilities under appropriate rating criteria considering an evaluation based on ankylosis, if the Veteran's functional loss due to pain (supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the Veteran's undertaking the motion) is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis. For the purposes of this examination, the examiner must provide an evaluation of the Veteran's account of pain, swelling, and instability of his left knee as indicated in the Veteran's medical treatment history and lay statements, including in the VA treatment records and September 2023 VA examination.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including a clearly stated rationale for any opinions offered and conclusions reached. In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such statements by the Veteran regarding symptomatology and medical history must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions concerning the onset and severity of his disability. If such reports are rejected by the examiner, a reason for doing so must be provided.
