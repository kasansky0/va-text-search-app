ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left elbow lateral epicondylitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left elbow lateral epicondylitis is proximately due to his service-connected right shoulder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left elbow lateral epicondylitis as secondary to his service-connected right shoulder on a causation basis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1984 to July 1991.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the May 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  The RO completed the additional development by obtaining an examination.  In the June 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO again denied the Veteran's claim.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 RO supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

For the current decision, the Board has recharacterized the issue as a claim for service connection for left elbow lateral epicondylitis, as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder, in view of the Veteran's assertions and the medical evidence of record, as described below.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran did not waive the remainder of his window to request a docket switch pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (Jun. 21, 2024).  Because the current decision is a full grant of the benefit sought, the lack of a waiver represents only harmless error by the Board.

Entitlement to service connection for left elbow lateral epicondylitis is granted.

The Veteran contends his left elbow disability is due to his service-connected right shoulder disability.  The Board resolves doubt in the Veteran's favor and agrees.

Direct service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection can also be granted on a secondary basis if a Veteran has (1) a current disability, (2) a separate disability already subject to service connection, and (3) the first disability is proximately due to or the result of or aggravated beyond its natural progress by the service-connected disability.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  A "baseline level of severity" of the non-service-connected condition must be established by medical evidence in order to award secondary service connection based on aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]hether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue to be addressed by the Board").

Once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.  See Layno, supra (distinguishing between competency- "a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered"-and credibility, "a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted").  The Board is also charged with the duty to assess the probative weight given to all evidence. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1046 (1998); Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the Veteran the benefit of the doubt.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the June 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded that the Veteran has a current left elbow disability and that his right shoulder is already service connected.  These are prior favorable findings the Board will not disturb.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c); 20.801(a).  Therefore, the Veteran has met the first and second elements of secondary service connection.  See Allen v. Brown, supra.

As to the final element of secondary service connection, the evidence is in approximate balance, and the Veteran must be afforded the benefit of the doubt.  

The Veteran has been service-connected for the residuals of a right shoulder prosthesis since 2010.  See Codesheet.  Since January 2019, his right shoulder has been rated as 60 percent disabling.  

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ in February 2022, seeking direct service connection for left elbow traumatic bursitis.  He also stated this was due to an accident on November 13, 1989, during his active service.  

VA examined the Veteran's left elbow in March 2022.  The Veteran is right-handed.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of left elbow traumatic bursitis during service, citing three STR notes from November 1989.  The examiner noted an onset of worsening left elbow pain in 1989.  The examiner wrote, "Veteran cannot recall an inciting injury of the left elbow but reports a gradual progression of left elbow pain.  Initially, the Veteran would feel a popping sensation and pain with full elbow extension, which has worsened over time."  Upon examination, they also diagnosed lateral epicondylitis.  

The examiner noted flare-ups of increased pain and stiffness, with reduced range of motion.  These flare-ups were usually caused by overuse or the Veteran sleeping on his left arm.  The Veteran has reduced range of motion, and painful motion on use of his left forearm, both of which the examiner attributed to his lateral epicondylitis.  The examiner also remarked that the Veteran "has significant loss of the functional use of his right arm due to shoulder condition, thus his left upper extremity is used incompensation."

The examiner explained that "[b]ursitis is typically secondary to trauma and is relatively common with repeated trauma and sports injuries that lead to bleeding within the bursa."  However, "[n]on-infective bursitis is normally self-limiting and treated with rest, ice, compression, and the use of NSAIDs.  Recurrence and chronic sequalae are atypical."  

The examiner went on to opine that the Veteran's bursitis was less likely than not due to his injury in-service.  The examiner explained:

The claimed condition of traumatic bursitis of the left elbow is less likely than not caused by the claimed in-service injury.  There are service treatment records from November 1989 that reflect treatment for traumatic bursitis of the left elbow while in service, however, beyond that date the Veteran's records are silent for chronic or continuous elbow complaints either while in service or after service discharge.  The Veteran today does present on examination with a diagnosis of left lateral epicondylitis, which is an overuse injury, however, this is likely accounted for by the Veteran's overuse of the left upper extremity to compensate for a significant limitation in the functional use of his right upper extremity as opposed to lingering symptoms of the 1989 injury.

The examiner did not complete the section of the form for a secondary service connection opinion.

The Veteran was examined again in June 2024.  The Veteran reported that in November 1989, he tripped and fell on his left elbow.  His arm was in a sling, and he was placed on light duty for a week.  The examiner then opined that the Veteran's left elbow disability was less likely than not due to his service-connected right shoulder disability.  The examiner wrote, "[t]here is no medical evidence that having a shoulder replacement in a shoulder should cause a condition to the contralateral elbow."

The Board agrees with the Veteran that the February 2022 opinion is sufficient to grant the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  While the examiner did not fill in the secondary service connection section of the form, their rationale includes a complete positive nexus opinion for secondary service connection, albeit for lateral epicondylitis and not bursitis.  

Moreover, the examiner's reasoning is persuasive and based on an accurate and thorough review of the evidence.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion obtains probative weight from "factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion").  As the 2022 opinion demonstrates, the Veteran (who is right-handed) has to overuse his left arm due to his service-connected right shoulder disability.  He has been diagnosed with a left elbow disability typically caused by overuse.  The Board affords this opinion with great probative weight.

The June 2024 opinion is not entitled to any probative weight.  It does not address the theory of secondary service connection from the 2022 examination, or the relevant evidence.  The statement that there is no relevant evidence is inaccurate, and the rationale is conclusory.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to a grant of secondary service connection for his left elbow lateral epicondylitis.
