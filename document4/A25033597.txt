DOCKET NO. 210209-141988
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In October 2024, after receiving a rating evaluation of 100 percent, and prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-4138 requesting that his pending VA Form 10182 appeal be withdrawn.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for written withdrawal of the Veteran's appeal, seeking entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and service connection for tinnitus, have been met.  38 U.S.C.ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R.ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from March 1968 to April 1970.  For his meritorious service, he was awarded a Combat Action Ribbon and Vietnam Service Medal, among others.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on appeal from denial of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus service connection claims.  The Board observes that the Veteran requested the hearing docket in his February 2021 VA Form 10182 - Notice of Disagreement (NOD), noting he was appealing a January 2021 Regional Office rating decision.  Although there was not a January 2021 rating decision at issue, the Board accepted the February 2021 NOD form and docketed the requested bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus appeal.  A hearing date has been pending since that time.

In January 2023, the Veteran was awarded a 100 percent disability rating.  As of that date, the Veteran's only pending VA compensation claim is the bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus hearing docket appeal.  In October 2024, the Veteran contacted VA indicating that he no longer wished to pursue his pending hearing or appeal, as he was satisfied with his current 100 percent rating.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a written December 2024 request to withdraw his hearing request regarding the pending bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus claims.  See October 2024 Report of General Information; December 2024 Statement in Support of the Claim.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for written withdrawal of the appeal have been satisfied.  See 38 C.F.R.ยง 20.205.  The Veteran has withdrawn his appeal and no longer desires to pursue entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  

There remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
