DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment throughout the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to TDIU are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102. 4.16, 4.19. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from January 1968 to August 1971.

The decision on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) was issued in December 2019 as an initial decision. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Veteran filed VA Form 21-8940 (Veterans Application for Increased Compensation, or Express TDIU Claim) in June 2018; and VA Form 21-526b (Supplemental Claim) for TDIU on the same date. The AOJ denied the claim in September 2018. In October 2018, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement) selecting the Decision Review Officer (DRO) Review Process on the September 2018 AOJ decision. 

The Veteran then opted into the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) in October 2018, moving the appeal from the Legacy system of review into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system, and selecting higher-level review of the September 2018 decision. The AOJ deferred adjudication in February 2019 for further development, and then denied the claim in September 2019. 

In October 2019, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim), citing the September 2019 higher-level review decision. The AOJ readjudicated the claim and denied it in December 2019. In January 2020, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) citing the decision dated in December 2019, selecting the Hearing docket.

A hearing was held before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in May 2023, and the Board issued a decision denying TDIU in December 2023. In September 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) (received October 2024) issued an Order granting a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) to partially vacate the Board's December 2023 decision. See September 2024 JMPR. 

Specifically, the parties agreed in the September 2024 JMPR that partial vacatur and remand are required because the Board erred by not providing an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its December 2023 decision by failing to address favorable evidence. See Tucker v. West, 11 Vet. App. 369, 374 (1998); Thompson v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 187, 188 (2000) (per curiam order); September 2024 JMPR.

On remand, the Board will readjudicate the Veteran's claim and address the favorable evidence outlined in the JMPR based on the record before it. See September 2024 JMPR. The Board has a duty to follow instructions given by the Court. Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998). Accordingly, a remand is necessary for readjudication of the Veteran's claim. 

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2019 decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his Representative, at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.  

The Board notes the review period begins from the date the Veteran filed his express TDIU claim (June 5, 2018) and includes evidence submitted by the Veteran or his Representative at the Board hearing (May 31, 2023), to include testimony provided at the hearing; and evidence submitted within 90 days following the hearing (August 29, 2023). 38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a). The Board will also consider additional argument submitted by the Veteran or his Representative following the Boards post-Court notification letter (October 24, 2024, to January 22, 2025) as agreed in the JMPR. See September 2024 JMPR; May 2023 Hearing Transcript.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability was previously restored to 40 percent effective June 25, 2018, and will not address the matter further except as it pertains to the negative functional impact his hearing loss has on his ability to work. See September 2024 JMPR. 

Additionally, the Board notes during the pendency of this claim, the Veteran was found to be 100 percent disabled beginning March 10, 2023, from his service-connected disabilities. See December 2023 Codesheet.

TDIU

The Veteran contends he is not able to work due to his severe PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus disabilities. And he retired early because he feared he would be terminated based on his employer's reprimands concerning his inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, inability to be calm at work, and his inability to control his behavior around customers. His depression makes it very difficult to do his work or get along with others. See June 2018 VA Treatment records; March 2019 Veteran Lay Statement; October 2019 Lay Statement; May 2023 Hearing Transcript.

Additionally, the Veteran contends his ability to concentrate at work is negatively impacted by his trouble sleeping and PTSD-related nightmares: they are so bad that his wife no longer sleeps with him due to his unconscious thrashing, punching and shoving at night; and he must have a railing on his bed to keep him safe. He has chronic fatigue from sleep disturbances and sometimes his PTSD symptoms cause him to be unable to get out of bed. See May 2023 Hearing Transcript.

Moreover, he has trouble being around people, crowds, and noise. He becomes irritated and is not able to adjust to the changing technologies required by his job installing doors. Additionally, due to his severe hearing loss disability he is unable to hear or understand conversation causing him to become irritated and rude with customers. See June 2018, August 2018, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, September 2019 VA Treatment Records; November 2019 VA Examination; May 2023 Hearing Transcript. 

Finally, the Veteran contends his anxiety, and nightmares have worsened since retirement. Sometimes he will hideout on his boat for a while to be away from his family and the chaos of life. See April 2019 VA Treatment Records; May 2023 Hearing Transcript.

Upon review of the record, the Board concludes the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

Relevant Legal Principals

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ("although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify").

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 491 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), a TDIU rating may be assigned in cases in which the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of their service-connected disabilities, provided that either the Veteran's single service-connected disability is ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if the Veteran has multiple service-connected disabilities, one of the disabilities is ratable at 40 percent or more and the others bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.

The term "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains economic and noneconomic components. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). A protected environment includes lower income positions that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market. See LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). The noneconomic component requires consideration of a Veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment. In determining whether a Veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, attention is given to the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; the Veteran's physical ability to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue; and the Veteran's mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

In evaluating a Veteran's employability, consideration may be given to his level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16, 4.19; Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 168 (1991). The fact that a Veteran may be unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not determinative. The ultimate question is whether a Veteran, because of service-connected disability, is incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Finally, the Board must determine whether the evidence supports the Veteran's claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate balance" (meaning nearly equal) between evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Facts and Analysis 

As noted above, the review period begins June 5, 2018; and the reviewable evidence includes evidence that was associated with the claims file prior to December 2, 2019, and submitted by the Veteran during the period from May 31, 2023, to August 29, 2023. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.302(a).

The record on review includes VA examinations from June 2018 and November 2019; and VA treatment records from June 2018 to September 2019 (as outlined above). 

Here, the Veteran has a high school education, as well as two years of college. The Veteran worked in construction and transitioned to electrical work, specializing in door automation. The Veteran worked in the automatic door business from 1984 to 2017. See June 2018 VA Form 21-8940; March 2019, April 2019 VA Treatment Records. And as noted above, he retired in March 2017 due to his disabilities. See March 2019 VA Form 21-4192; June 2018 VA Form 21-8940; May 2023 Hearing Transcript.

Beginning with the June 2018 VA examination, the examiner finds the Veteran's occupational and social impairment to be characterized as occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood-which is indicative of a 70 percent rating for his PTSD. In making this determination, the examiner notes the Veteran's symptoms include: chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. And the Veteran endorsed intermittent passive suicidal ideation but did not endorse active suicidal ideation, and no plan or intent. See June 2018 VA Examination.

Turning to the November 2019 VA examination, the examiner notes the Veteran's occupational and social impairment as occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation-indicative of a 30 percent rating. The examiner notes the Veteran's symptoms include depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty with sleep; intrusive thoughts; low energy; avoidance behaviors; hypervigilance; anger; and problems with concentration. Although the examiner finds the Veteran's PTSD to be improving, the examiner also notes the Veteran's symptoms negatively impact his ability to engage in both physical and sedentary occupational tasks. See November 2019 VA Examination. 

Although the Veteran's occupational and social functioning seem to improve over time, the psychiatric symptoms that negatively impact his ability to work are still present including depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty with sleep. See June 2018 VA Examination; November 2019 VA Examination. 

Additionally, the Veteran contends his anxiety, and nightmares have worsened since retirement. See April 2019 VA Treatment Records (stating sometimes he will hideout on his boat for a while to be away from his family and the chaos of life.) And the positive shift in his occupational functioning improved after he retired.

The Board finds the portions of the VA examinations from June 2018 and November 2019 dealing with the Veteran's current symptomatology to be both competent and credible because they are supported by the Veteran's treatment records and include consideration of the Veteran's lay statements. 

However, insofar as the examinations find the Veteran's occupational and social functioning as improving without consideration that the symptoms that seem to have the most negative impact on his ability to work are still present (sleep disturbances, chronic fatigue, memory loss, isolation, and hearing loss), the Board finds the VA examinations unpersuasive as to the Veteran's ability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. Thus, the Board assigns the VA examinations minimal probative value. Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that his symptoms have worsened. Because his treatment records correlate with his lay statements throughout the appeal period, the Board finds him to be competent and credible to describe his symptoms and reactions to the same. See June 2018, August 2018, February 2019, March 2019, April 2019, May 2019, September 2019 VA Treatment Records; November 2019 VA Examination; May 2023 Hearing Transcript; Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Thus, the Board finds the Veterans lay statements persuasive and assigns them considerable weight. 

Given the record noted above, the Board finds the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities during the relevant period (PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus) have rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

The Veteran's inability to hear and understand conversation are indications that he cannot follow employer instructions or communicate with customers. His communication is further impacted by his depression and inability to concentrate-causing him to lose his temper and become irritated and rude with others. His sleep disturbances (trouble sleeping and nightmares) cause him to be tired at work which also trigger both his depression and irritability. All of which negatively impact his ability to mentally perform his job duties as required by employment. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Finally, given the Veteran's educational and occupational background, along with his statements that he has difficulty keeping up with technology due to his service-connected disabilities, it is unlikely that he would qualify for a different occupation outside of construction, electrical work, and door installations-all of which require him to listen and understand direction, engage with others, and maintain composure. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Accordingly, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds entitlement to a TDIU is warranted.
