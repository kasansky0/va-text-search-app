REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from May 2013 to April 2014, and from January 2020 to January 2021, with prior and intervening service in the National Guard.  

In March 2023, the Veteran filed these claims.  See VA Form 21-526EZ received in March 2023.  In September 2023, the RO denied service connection for a back disability, a right knee disability, a left knee disability, a left shoulder disability, and hearing loss.  

In June 2024, the Veteran filed a decision review request: Board appeal (notice of disagreement) (VA Form 10182), electing for Direct Review Lane.  Under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the issuance of the appealed rating decision may be considered; rather, the Board review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the September 29, 2023 rating decision. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  Therefore, the Board may not by operation of law consider this evidence in conjunction with this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and resubmit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for a disability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability is due to disease or injury which was incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may also be granted for an organic disease of the nervous system, such as a sensorineural hearing loss, when manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  

For all claims, the Veteran's personnel file includes a report of investigation, line of duty and misconduct status (DD Form 261) dated in June 2018 which shows the following: The Veteran was noted to have sustained an injury from a basic traffic accident involving a rollover of his vehicle ("motor vehicle accident") while on active duty for training.  The accident was in the line of duty.  The diagnosis was concussion without loss of consciousness, initial encounter.  The injury was deemed at the time as not likely to result in a claim against the government for future medical care.  See also DD Form 2173.      

1.  Back disability.

The Veteran's service treatment records include multiple Pre-Deployment Health Assessments and Annual Periodic Health Assessments (DD Forms 2795 and 3024) (Health Assessments).  Health Assessments dated in March and July of 2014 indicate that the Veteran had not been bothered by back pain in the last month.  Health Assessments dated in February and December of 2019, December 2020, January 2022 and February 2023 indicate that the Veteran has not had recurring low back pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.  A March 2020 report notes complaints of left leg neurological symptoms.  On examination, the thoracolumbar spine ranges of motion were normal.  There was no pain on motion.  A pulled muscle was suspected, with a notation that he may need an X-ray of the lumbar spine if his symptoms did not resolve in a week.  A December 2020 Health Assessment shows that the Veteran indicated that he had not had back pain in the past month.  A December 2020 separation examination report (DD Form 2808) and an associated report of medical history do not contain any complaints, findings, or diagnoses shown to be relevant.  Following separation from active-duty service, a February 2023 HA indicates that the Veteran has not had recurring low back pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.  

A September 2023 VA back disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) shows that the Veteran reported a history of a back injury in June 2014 that began with routine military activities, and with a motor vehicle accident.  He reported current symptoms of a dull ache in his low back with difficulty doing daily chores because his back "catches."  He denied currently receiving treatment for his back symptoms.  On examination, the ranges of motion in the back were normal.  There was no evidence of pain.  There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  The DBQ notes that service treatment records are silent for any back injury or pathology.  The examiner concluded that it is less likely as not that the Veteran has a back disability that was incurred in, or caused by, his service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's report of marching with a rucksack during service had been considered.  However, there is not a current diagnosis.  

The Veteran is not shown to have been treated for back symptoms during service.  He was not found to have a back condition upon separation from either period of active-duty service.  Accordingly, a chronic back condition is not shown during service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  There is no competent opinion of record in support of the claim.  The only competent opinion of record is the opinion of the September 2023 VA examiner, who concluded that the Veteran does not have a back disability.   

The Board acknowledges that pain alone, even without a diagnosed back disability can be considered a disability for VA purposes, but only if it causes functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Here, such has not been shown.

 Accordingly, a current back disability is not shown, and the claim is denied.  Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998).   

2.  Service connection, right knee and left knee disabilities.

The Veteran's treatment records include a December 2019 Health Assessment which indicates that the Veteran has not had recurring joint pain since his last health assessment.  A March 2020 report notes complaints of left leg neurological symptoms.  On examination, strength of the bilateral knee extension was 5/5.  No lower extremity weakness was observed.  There was no decreased response at either knee or either medial leg at (L4).  A pulled muscle was suspected.  A December 2020 Health Assessment indicates that the Veteran he had not had knee pain in the past month, and that the Veteran has not had recurring joint pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.  A December 2020 separation examination report (DD Form 2808) shows the Veteran's lower extremities were clinically evaluated as normal.  It does not contain any complaints or diagnoses shown to be relevant.  Following separation from the Veteran's second period of active duty, Health Assessments dated in January 2022 and February 2023 indicate that the Veteran has not had recurring joint pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.  

A September 2023 VA back conditions DBQ shows that the Veteran had 5/5 strength in his bilateral knees on extension.  Reflexes at the knees were normal (2+).  A sensory examination was normal at the bilateral thigh/knee (L3/4).  There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  

A September 2023 VA knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the Veteran reported a history of a knee condition in June 2014 with bilateral knee pain that began with routine activities, and following a motor vehicle accident.  He reported currently experiencing dull aches of knee discomfort, but denied receiving any treatment for knee symptoms.  He reported that his knee symptoms make it difficult to do his daily chores.  On examination, the knees had normal ranges of motion.  There was no ankylosis or muscle atrophy.  There was no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability.  There was no history of a ligament tear, and no current ligament tear.  There was no patellar instability or recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, or any other type of fibular impairment.  There is no meniscus (semilunar cartilage) condition.  There is no history of knee surgery.  The examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran has a knee disability that was incurred in, or caused by, his service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's report of marching with a rucksack during service had been considered.  However, there was no pathology to warrant a diagnosis.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any knee injury or pathology.  

The Veteran is not shown to have been treated for right knee or left knee symptoms during service.  He was not found to have a right knee or left knee condition upon separation from either period of active-duty service.  Knee pain has not been shown to cause functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders, supra.  Accordingly, a chronic right knee or left knee condition is not shown during service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  There is no competent opinion of record in support of the claim.  The only competent opinion of record is the opinion of the September 2023 VA examiner, who concluded that the Veteran does not have a right knee or left knee disability.  Accordingly, a current right knee and left knee disability are not shown, and the claims are denied.  Gilpin.   

3.  Left shoulder disability.

The Veteran's service treatment records include reports dated in March 2014 which show that the Veteran reported a two-week history of right shoulder pain while lifting objects.  There are notations of a right shoulder injury "which occurred during this period of Active Duty."  An examination was normal.  Reports dated in late March 2014 report show that the Veteran reported that his pain had improved and that this condition was characterized as "resolved."  A March 2014 Health Assessment indicates that the Veteran had not been bothered by joint pain in the last month.  A December 2019 Health Assessment indicates that the Veteran had not had recurring joint pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.  Reports dated in 2020 note problems that include "join pain, localized in the shoulder," and recurrent sporadic left shoulder pain.  A March 2020 report notes that strength in the upper extremities was normal.  A December 2020 Health Assessment notes that the Veteran reported sporadic left shoulder pain.  A December 2020 separation examination report (DD Form 2808) does not contain any complaints, findings, or diagnoses shown to be relevant.  Following separation from the Veteran's second period of active duty, Health Assessments dated in January 2022 and February 2023 indicate that the Veteran has not had recurring joint pain since his last health assessment that required medical care or impacted his duty performance.

A September 2023 VA shoulder and arm DBQ shows that the Veteran reported having shoulder pain in June 2014 that began with routine activities, and after a motor vehicle accident.  The Veteran reported that during service he marched for miles with a 90-pound rucksack.  He reported that he currently has dull aches, pain, and discomfort, and difficulty with daily chores due to pain.  He denied currently receiving treatment.  On examination, the left shoulder had a normal range of motion.  There was no ankylosis or muscle atrophy.  Testing was negative for a rotator cuff condition.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis.  The examiner concluded that it is less likely than not that the Veteran has a left shoulder condition that was incurred in, or caused by, his service.  The examiner explained that there is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis.  The Veteran's report of having to pick up heavy items constantly and move them to and from different places was considered.  However, no current diagnosis exists.  The examiner noted that service treatment records are silent for any shoulder injury or pathology.   

The Veteran is not shown to have been treated for left shoulder symptoms during his first period of active-duty service.  He was not found to have a left shoulder condition upon separation from his first period of active-duty service.  About six years later, in December 2020, during his second period of active-duty service, the Veteran reported having left shoulder pain.  However, a shoulder disability was not diagnosed, and there are no imaging studies or other medical evidence documenting left shoulder pathology.  The Veteran was not found to have a left shoulder condition upon separation from his second period of active-duty service.  Accordingly, a chronic left shoulder condition is not shown during either period of active-duty service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Thereafter, the Veteran did not report left shoulder symptoms in Health Assessments dated in January 2022 and February 2023.  There is no competent opinion of record in support of the claim.  The only competent opinion of record is the opinion of the September 2023 VA examiner, who concluded that the Veteran does not have a left shoulder disability.  Additionally, shoulder pain has not been shown to cause functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Saunders, supra.  Accordingly, a current left shoulder disability is not shown, and the claim is denied.  Gilpin.   

4.  Hearing loss.

Applicable regulations provide that impaired hearing shall be considered a disability when the auditory thresholds in any of the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz are 40 decibels or greater; the thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores are 94 percent or less.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

38 C.F.R. § 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing loss disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Rather, when audiometric test results at a veteran's separation from service do not meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, a veteran may nevertheless establish service connection for current hearing disability by submitting medical evidence that the current disability is causally related to service.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).

Where the requirements for hearing loss disability pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 are not met until several years after separation from service, the record must include evidence of exposure to disease or injury in service that would adversely affect the auditory system and post-service test results meeting the criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Hensley, 5 Vet. App at 155.  If the record shows (a) acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service and audiometric test results reflect an upward shift in tested thresholds while in service, though still not meeting the requirements for "disability" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, and (b) post service audiometric testing produces findings which meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; then the rating authorities must consider whether there is a medically sound basis to attribute the post service findings to the injury in service, or whether these findings are more properly attributable to intervening causes.  Id. at 159.   

The Veteran's discharge (DD Form 214) shows that his specialty was military policeman.  

The Veteran's service treatment records include a May 2013 report which shows that he denied having a history of trouble hearing.  Health Assessments dated in May 2013, July 2014, and September 2017 indicate that the Veteran is not bothered at all with trouble hearing.  Health Assessments dated in February and December of 2019 indicate that the Veteran has not had a change in his hearing that affects his duty performance since his last health assessment.  A December 2019 Health Assessment also indicates that the Veteran has been bothered a little from trouble hearing.  A December 2020 Health Assessment shows that the Veteran indicated that he had not had trouble hearing in the past month, and that he is not bothered at all with trouble hearing.  A December 2020 separation examination report (DD Form 2808) shows that the Veteran's ears and drums were clinically evaluated as normal.  This report does not contain any complaints or diagnoses shown to be relevant.  This report includes audiometric test results which show that the Veteran does not have hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes.  An associated December 2020 report notes that testing results are within normal limits, and that this was explained to the Veteran.  No significant threshold shift is present.  Following separation from the Veteran's second period of active duty, a February 2023 Health Assessment indicates that the Veteran reported a change in his hearing that affected his duty performance but that he had not received medical care.  The report indicates that he was not on a profile for a change in hearing.  

A September 2023 VA hearing loss DBQ shows that the Veteran reported difficulty hearing at work.  He has difficulty hearing alarms for work.  He has difficulty hearing his family.  He has difficulty hearing his daughter's food pump and his wife's insulin pump.  The examiner noted that the Veteran' military occupation specialty was military police, which has a moderate probability for noise exposure.  The Veteran had service in Afghanistan between 2013 and 2014.  On examination, the Veteran did not have a hearing loss disability in either ear as defined for VA purposes.  

The Board finds that the claim must be denied.  Although the Veteran is conceded to have been exposed to noise during service, there is no audiometric evidence to show hearing loss in either ear during service or thereafter.  Audiometric test results dated in June 2012, December 2019, December 2020, and February 2023 show that the Veteran does not have a hearing loss disability in either ear for VA purposes.  There is no evidence of sensorineural hearing loss for VA purposes in either ear within one year of separation from service.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  The Veteran is not shown to have hearing loss in his right ear or his left ear, as defined for VA purposes, following separation from either period of active-duty service.  Gilpin. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  There is no competent opinion of record in favor of the claim.  Accordingly, the claim is denied.  

For all claims, the Board has considered the Veteran's assertions that the claimed disabilities may be related to an accident in which his vehicle rolled over while on active duty for training (ACDUTRA).  The relevant June 2018 line of duty report was discussed supra.  That line of duty report does not note complaints or findings of back, knee, or left shoulder symptoms.  With regard to the possibility of direct service connection based on ACDUTRA, there is no service or nonservice-medical evidence of treatment to show that the Veteran has any of the claimed conditions as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of ACDUTRA.  The Board has determined that none of the claimed conditions are shown.  Given the foregoing, service connection is not warranted based on a period of ACDUTRA.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), 3.6.  

For all service connection claims, although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), the Veteran is not competent to state that his observable symptoms are manifestations of chronic pathology or diagnosed disability, unless such a relationship is one to which a lay person's observation is competent, as this falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The VA examinations took the Veteran's competent (subjective) statements with regard to his history and current symptoms into account.  The Board therefore finds that the medical findings which implicate the criteria for service connection are more probative than the Veteran's assertions.  Id.  

As the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the criteria for service connection for the claimed conditions have not been met, the claims are denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
