DOCKET NO. 241003-481621
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the proposal to terminate the separate evaluation for the Veteran's insomnia disorder and evaluate it with his service-connected tinnitus based on clear and unmistakable error is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to evaluate the Veteran's insomnia disorder with his service-connected tinnitus with a single evaluation of 10 percent; however, the July 2024 rating decision does not constitute a final or adverse action by the AOJ.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for the proposed combined evaluation for insomnia disorder and tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1993 to February 2000.

This matter comes on appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), hereinafter referred to as the AOJ.  The Veteran submitted a timely VA Form 10182 in October 2024 in which he elected the Direct Review docket.  Accordingly, the Board can consider the evidence of record as of July 29, 2024.

In the appealed July 2024 rating action, the AOJ proposed to discontinue the separate evaluation for the insomnia disorder and combine it with the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus.  A proposal to discontinue a disability rating is not an appealable issue because it is not an actual decision but is, instead, a proposed action, which is not binding on the agency and does not change the Veteran's level of compensation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; see also Majeed v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 421, 433-34 (2002).

Notably, after the AOJ's issuance of the July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran had 60 days to provide evidence as to why the changes should not be made.  Only after these procedures have been observed, if the additional evidence showing that the benefits should be continued at their present level is not received, "final adverse action will be taken."  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(h).  Accordingly, the July 2024 rating decision was not an adjudicative determination; rather, the July 2024 rating decision was a proposal for a future determination.  Indeed, in a subsequent December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ decided to discontinue the separate evaluation for the insomnia disorder and combine it with tinnitus at a 10 percent evaluation.

As such, the July 2024 rating decision does not constitute an adjudicative determination from which a notice of disagreement may be filed.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201; Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011) (concluding that a deferred rating decision does not constitute an appealable adjudicative action).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  Here, there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.5, 20.101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.105; see also Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992).

Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), allows for a docket switch 60 days from the date of the VA Form 10182 or one year from the AOJ decision, whichever is later.  The Board acknowledges that one year has not yet passed from the date of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, this issue is not properly on appeal on a legal basis, and the decision would not be any different regardless of whether the entire period of time is provided.

Moreover, the Veteran is not prejudiced as the appeal period for the December 2024 rating decision, which was the final adjudicative determination, is still open.  Therefore, he is not prevented from filing a Notice of Disagreement in response to the December 2024 rating decision.
