DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on February 7, 2018, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of medical services provided to the Veteran on February 7, 2018. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on February 7, 2018, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical services to the Veteran. 

In April 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, from the appellant electing the Direct Review docket to review a February 2021 decision issued by a VA AOJ, which denied the claim for payment of the cost of medical services provided the Veteran on February 7, 2018, due to the claim being untimely filed.

The appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on February 7, 2018, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending. The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the February 7, 2018, episode of care. See September 2021 correspondence; September 2021 Report of Contact. The record indicates that reimbursement in the amount of $204.78 was issued in September 2021. 

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care; however, the administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the February 7, 2018, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial, and a full grant of the benefit sought in this instant appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees as to the instant issue on appeal, and the appeal is therefore dismissed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
