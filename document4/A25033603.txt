FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's intent to file was submitted on August 9, 2023; he met the requirements for service connection for allergic rhinitis from that date and was subsequently awarded service connection pursuant to the PACT Act, which became effective August 10, 2022.

2. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not manifested as rhinitis with polyps.

3. The earliest intent to file in the Veteran's record for GERD is August 9, 2023.

4. The Veteran's symptoms of GERD are commensurate with those considered under the 30 percent rating of Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2007 to February 2013.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in January 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service. Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Effective March 24, 2015, claims are required to be filed on standard forms, thus eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). A claim for VA compensation must generally be in the form prescribed by the VA Secretary. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). Any communication or action, however, received from the claimant, or certain specified individuals on the claimant's behalf, that indicates intent to apply for a benefit, and identifies that benefit, may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

Where compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, or a liberalizing VA issue approved by the Secretary of VA or by the Secretary's direction, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act or the administrative issue. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, see, e.g., Brown v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 290, 296 (2007). If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of the liberalizing VA law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. Id. In order for a claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment under this section, the evidence must show that the claimant met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination of entitlement. Id. The retroactive provisions of § 3.114 apply both to original and reopened claims, as well as to claims for increase. Id. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes (DCs). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt will be granted to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. "Staged" ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

In rating disabilities, VA should not differentiate symptomatology attributed to nonservice-connected disability from symptomatology attributed to service-connected disability in the absence of medical evidence that does so. Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998) (per curiam). In such cases, the reasonable doubt doctrine dictates that all symptoms be attributed to the service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022 for service connection for allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than September 1, 2022 for service-connected allergic rhinitis.

By way of background, the Veteran submitted an intent to file on August 9, 2023. He subsequently filed his claim for service connection on September 1, 2023. The AOJ granted service-connection due to the PACT Act and backdated the Veteran's effective date one year, to September 1, 2022, due to the Veteran meeting all qualifications for retroactive payment from the date of his claim.

Upon review of the record, the Veteran met all qualifications for retroactive payment from the date of his submission of his intent to file on August 9, 2023. However, as the PACT Act was signed into law on August 10, 2022, the earliest date the Veteran can be awarded service connection for a condition pursuant to the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. 

Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022 is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis due to the PACT Act. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran contends that his symptoms of allergic rhinitis are of such severity as to warrant an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent.

The Board notes that the Veteran's rating for allergic rhinitis has been assigned pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522. Under Diagnostic Code 6522, allergic rhinitis will be rated as 10 percent disabling when it is manifested by a greater than fifty percent obstruction of both nasal passages or complete obstruction of one nasal passage, without polyps. A 30 percent disability rating is the maximum available rating and is warranted when polyps are present.

In an October 2023 VA examination, the examiner found that there was greater than 50 percent obstruction of both nasal passages due to rhinitis. The examiner found no evidence of complete obstruction of either nasal passage, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, granulomatous conditions, or, most pertinently, nasal polyps. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, and his reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, he does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the Veteran experienced nasal polyps in the record available to the Board to review on appeal.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increase, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). In making this determination, the Board notes that neither the Veteran nor her representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). Moreover, as the Veteran has not contended, nor does the evidence show, that this disability renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) has not been raised by the record. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). In this regard, the Veteran did apply for TDIU in June 2017, well before the current appeal arose, but this application only cites to posttraumatic stress disorder and not to the disorders addressed in this appeal. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023 for service connection for GERD.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 9, 2023 for service-connected GERD.

Upon review of the record, the Veteran submitted his intent to file on August 9, 2023. He subsequently filed his claim for service connection on September 1, 2023. The Veteran was granted service connection with an effective date of August 9, 2023, the date of the submission of the intent to file. There is no record of an intent to file this claim prior to August 9, 2023, and, unlike the Veteran's service connection for allergic rhinitis, his service connection for GERD was not granted pursuant to the PACT Act and is not eligible for retroactive dating.

Thus, the current date of entitlement to service connection for GERD, August 9, 2023, is the earliest date for such entitlement. Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date is not warranted for the Veteran's service-connected GERD. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

4. Entitlement to an initial disability rating of 30 percent for GERD.

The Veteran contends that his GERD symptoms are of such severity as to warrant an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent. 

The Veteran's GERD is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346, for hiatal hernia. During the pendency of the appeal, VA published amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the Schedule of Ratings for the Digestive System, effective May 19, 2024. Under the amended criteria, a new diagnostic code, that is, Diagnostic Code 7206, was added for GERD, which provides the same rating criteria as Diagnostic Code 7203 for stricture of the esophagus. See 89 Fed. Reg. 19735.

Prior to May 19, 2024, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

"Considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012). "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Id. at 1140.

In assigning a rating under Diagnostic Code 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

The rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also, Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (the Court recognized that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

Under the new Diagnostic Code 7206 for GERD, a 10 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilation no more than 2 times per year. A 50 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. An 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

The revised rating criteria apply to all claims received by VA or that are pending before the AOJ on or after May 19, 2024. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both the old and new rating criteria and the criteria which is more favorable to the Veteran's claim will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Board is not precluded from applying the prior version of an applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective date of the new regulations if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the claim, as here. 38 U.S.C. 5110(g).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2023. The examiner found the Veteran had symptoms of pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain. There was no evidence of esophageal stricture, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Here, a higher 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is warranted. In this case, the examination shows pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's GERD symptoms to be commensurate with persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. Therefore, a higher 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is warranted.

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran's GERD symptoms are commensurate with a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 due to his symptoms of pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain. Thus, the Veteran's claim for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for service connection for GERD is granted. In making this determination, the Board notes that neither the Veteran nor her representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette, supra. Moreover, as the Veteran has not contended, nor does the evidence show, that this disability renders him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the issue of entitlement to TDIU has not been raised by the record. Rice, supra.
