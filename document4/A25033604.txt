REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1978 to April 1982. 

The rating decisions on appeal were issued on July 25, 2023, and December 4, 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 16, 2023, decision that denied service connection for prostate cancer. In December 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 16, 2023, decision.  As to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus, the rating decision on appeal was issued on July 25, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision.

In the June 3, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, as to prostate cancer, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 16, 2023, decision that was later subject to HLR; and as to diabetes mellitus, the Board may only consider evidenced of record at the time of the July 25, 2023, AOJ rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board as to that matter. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus and entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his diabetes mellitus and prostate cancer stem from exposure to residuals of herbicide agents while serving in the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). See VA 21-526EZ (February 2019), Correspondence (March 2023), VA Form 10182 (June 2024). 

A 2017 VA Agent Orange examination report reflects that the Veteran reported to the clinician that he had been exposure to Agent Orange during his service in Korea from April to September 1980. At that time, he told the clinician that there was no vegetation in the area where he was stationed; that local Koreans in the area claimed to still be using Vietnam-era defoliants; and that he became sick after he was required to slow-crawl through the brush in a freshly sprayed area. See VAMC Other Output / Reports (March 2023).

The Veteran reported in December 2023, at this HLR Informal Conference, that he was in DMZ performing a night patrol and he laid down in a puddle to hide because he was in the light of sight; that he was in the rear security and, when he stood up, he "smelled like chemical-the dioxin," which he stated, "can stay in soil for 100 years."  Further, the Veteran reports that after this he "coughed up blood and ended up with tremors."  He states that it was in 2004 he realized that Agent Orange had been used there. See HLR - Informal Conference (December 2023).

The AOJ found that the Veteran has current diagnoses for type II diabetes mellitus and a history of prostate cancer from at least January 2019. These are favorable findings by the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

If a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during active service, service connection is presumed for various disorders, including prostate cancer and diabetes mellitus. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). However, based on the Veteran's dates and place of service, his exposure to herbicide agents is not presumed. The Veteran did not service in Vietnam or within 12 nautical miles during the applicable time frame-he does not contend otherwise.

Further, the Department of Defense (DoD) has identified specific units it has cited that served in areas along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in Korea where herbicides were used between April 1968 and July 1969. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iv). The Veteran did not serve in Korea during that time frame; his dates of service are from April 1978 to April 1982. However, that does not preclude the Veteran from establishing exposure otherwise.

The issues of entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus and entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal.

The VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides guidance on how to develop claims based on herbicide exposure on the Korean DMZ. In those cases where a Veteran claims exposure in Korea, and did not have service in any of the particular units designated as having been exposed during the required timeframe, AOJ should send a request to the VA Military Records Research Center (MRRC) for verification of exposure. See M21-1, Part VIII, Subpart i, 1.A.3.d. If the claim and available records do not provide sufficient details of the Veteran's Korean DMZ service, the Veteran should receive a letter notifying him. See id. See also Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018) (the Board is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases).

Here, service personnel records confirm that the Veteran was in Korea from April 1980 to April 1981, with service in the JSA from May 1980 to November 1980. See Military Personnel Record (MPRs) (December 2015). The Veteran's dates of service and assigned units do not correspond to those where exposure to herbicide agents may be presumed. The record does not reflect that the AOJ sent a request to the MRRC for verification of the Veteran's alleged exposure to herbicides nor determined that there was not sufficient information to complete an MRRC request. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Lastly, the Board acknowledges the February 2019 Veteran-provided medical opinion. It reflects that the Veteran has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and has a history of Agent Orange exposure; and that "There is data showing that Agent Orange can cause prostate cancer years after exposure." See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2019). The Board finds that this opinion is inadequate as it has not been established that the Veteran had herbicide agent (Agent Orange) exposure although he believes he had. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual basis is of no probative value).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Attempt to verify the Veteran's asserted exposure to herbicide agents while stationed in Korea. If more details are needed, contact the Veteran to request the information. If there is still insufficient information to verify exposure to herbicide agents, issue a Formal Finding outlining the steps taken to assist the Veteran and notify the Veteran of VA's inability to verify the in-service herbicide agent exposure.
