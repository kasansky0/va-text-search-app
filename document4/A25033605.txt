DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 1, 2018, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 1, 2018, for the award of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Since December 1, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer and PTSD have precluded him from securing or following a substantial gainful occupation.

2. Since December 1, 2018, the Veteran has total service-connected disabilities that are permanent in nature.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  Effective December 1, 2018, the criteria for TDIU are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

2. Effective December 1, 2018 the criteria for an award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1968 to May 1970.

These matters are before the Board following the appeal of a March 2024 rating decision, which constituted a higher level review (HLR) of an October 2022 rating decision.  

In February 2025, the Veteran timely appealed on a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record prior to October 20, 2022, the date of the rating decision subject to HLR.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301.

Effective Dates

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than September 19, 2019, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA.  

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within one year from such date otherwise, date of receipt of claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  A claim for TDIU is a claim for an increased rating.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 31-32 (2007).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that in order to be considered a valid claim, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form.  79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). 

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation."  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340 (a)(1), 4.15.

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

A VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability was received by the AOJ on September 19, 2019.  In an October 2022 rating decision, the AOJ determined that the disability picture presented as of that date showed the Veteran was unemployed due prostate cancer and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

However, the current appeal arises from an August 2017 proposal to reduce the Veteran's rating for his service-connected prostate cancer.  In September 2018, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer rating from 100 percent disabling to 40 percent disabling effective December 1, 2018.  In January and September 2019, the Veteran filed notices of disagreement, under the legacy system, to the September 2018 rating decision.  As part of the notice of disagreement, the Veteran also filed the September 2019 VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, indicating that his service-connected prostate cancer and PTSD prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.  The AOJ in its October 2022 rating decision erroneously determined that the effective date for the award of TDIU was September 19, 2019, as that was the date the Veteran filed his VA Form 21-8940.  However, as discussed above, the Veteran's TDIU claim arose as "part and parcel" of his notice of disagreement to the reduction of his rating for service-connected prostate cancer, pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009).  Throughout the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran has consistently maintained that his service-connected prostate cancer and PTSD combined prevented him from obtaining or retaining employment.  Consequently, as the TDIU claim arose from the AOJ's September 2018 rating reduction of service-connected prostate cancer and the Veteran's notice of disagreement to that reduction, the TDIU claim has been continuously pursued and remained pending since December 1, 2018, the effective date of the Veteran's rating reduction.  Indeed, no prior unadjudicated claims were outstanding.  

The Board is bound by the favorable finding of the AOJ regarding unemployability and its cause.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Further, the disability picture as of December 1, 2018, was the same as that relied upon by the AOJ.  Accordingly, a finding of entitlement to TDIU as December 1, 2018 is required as a matter of law.

The effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is directly related to a finding that the Veteran has a total disability that is permanent in nature.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.  As such, the Board finds that the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits is established from December 1, 2018, as that is the date as of which it has been found that the Veteran became permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected prostate cancer and PTSD.
