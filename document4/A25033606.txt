ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema has not manifested in attacks lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable disability rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7118.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1981 to January 1984, and from May 1985 to December 1985. The Veteran has a 100 percent combined disability rating since June 11, 2022.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in January 2024, and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record in regard to the claims adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). The Board also finds that, although VA has a duty to maximize benefits, entitlement to a total disability based on individual employability due to service connected disability (TDIU) has not been reasonably raised by the record. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 248 (2010); Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991). In this regard, the Veteran has not asserted, and the record does not indicate, a TDIU based on a single disability is warranted; but rather, after the rating decision on appeal, in January 2024, the Veteran submitted a formal TDIU application wherein he expressly argued that he is unemployable due to multiple service-connected disabilities, including: posttraumatic stress disorder, hypertension, heart disease, anemia and eye disorder. See VA 21-8940 (April 2024, December 2024). Therefore, TDIU is not within the scope of this appeal.

Lastly, below, the Board remands the issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus as the AOJ had a duty to obtain records scanned into VA's electronic health records system, known as Veterans Health Information System Technology Architecture (VistA) Imaging system. However, the Board finds that remand is not warranted as to the claim for a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema. The VistA records predate the relevant review period so they are not relevant to the severity of the bilateral ankle and foot edema during the rating review period before the Board. Thus, there was no duty to assist error vis-à-vis the claim for a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema, only the claim for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus as addressed below.

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed. Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema.

A December 2019 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral ankle and foot edema, and assigned a noncompensable rating, effective September 16, 2019.

On December 30, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), seeking a higher rating. A January 2024 rating decision denied a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema. This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024).

The rating review period for the claim for increase starts on December 30, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, plus a one year look back period to December 30, 2022. The rating review period ends on January 30, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024).

The Veteran contends that a higher rating is warranted, because he experiences intermittent edema with standing and walking. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024). He detailed increased symptoms with more constant swelling in his ankles after his hypertension medication was reduced; he reported having to wear special socks and inability to wear his shoes normally since the medication change.  See Buddy / Lay Statement (December 2023).

The Board concludes that a compensable rating for bilateral ankle and foot edema is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

The Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7118, for angioneurotic edema. Diagnostic Code 7118 provides compensation for a 10 percent rating for attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year. A 20 percent rating is provided for attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring five to eight times a year, or; attacks with laryngeal involvement of any duration occurring once or twice a year. A 40 percent rating is provided for attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days or longer and occurring more than eight times a year, or; attacks with laryngeal involvement of any duration occurring more than twice a year.

Turning to the evidence of record during the appeal period, the January 2024 Artery and Vein Condition Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects the Veteran's reports of his bilateral ankle and foot edema resulting in swelling approximately two to three time a month.  See C&P Exam at 2 (January 2024). The Veteran reported treating his edema with spironolactone at 12.5 milligrams daily.  No assistive devices or other medical treatment was indicated; the DBQ revealed no other findings, conditions, or symptoms related to the Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema. No varicose vein/post-phlebitic syndrome, Raynaud's disease/syndrome, peripheral arterial disease and thrombo-angiitis obliterans, any large artery aneurysm, aortic aneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, angioneurotic edema, or erythromelalgia was found. In terms of functional impact, the Veteran reported that his bilateral ankle and foot edema was triggered with prolonged standing or prolonged sitting.

VA treatment records show that, in December 2023, the Veteran reported swelling in the ankles that sometimes prevented him from wearing boots and having to switch to tennis shows. See CAPRI at 1 (January 2024). VA treatment records during the appeal period also show that the Veteran takes spironolactone, which he identified at his January 2024 DBQ as the medication he takes for bilateral ankle and foot edema, for his hypertension. See CAPRI (January 2024). 

Having carefully and sympathetically reviewed the relevant lay and medical evidence, the Board finds persuasive evidence of record weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema, because it was not more nearly manifested by attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year. In this regard, VA treatment records during the appeal period show one report of swelling in his ankles. Moreover, while the Veteran reported at his January 2024 DBQ that he took medication, spironolactone, for his bilateral ankle and foot edema, VA treatment records show instead that he takes spironolactone for his hypertension, which not presently on appeal before the Board. Indeed, as noted above, the Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema has manifested in no more than swelling - this does not equate to attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year, which is required for a higher rating of 10 percent. Furthermore, during the appeal period, the record is absent of reports of swelling other than on one occasion (in December 2023). Although there is evidence indicating that the Veteran is limited in activities due to his bilateral ankle and foot edema, such does not result in attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year to warrant a compensable rating.

No other diagnostic code is applicable, and the Board cannot identify a diagnostic code which would afford a compensable rating higher for the Veteran's bilateral ankle and foot edema. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7118.

In reaching the foregoing determination, the Board recognizes the Veteran's sincerely held belief that his disability is more severe than reflected by the currently assigned rating, and notes he is competent to describe his symptoms and their effects on his daily life and occupation. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (2007). However, he is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). The Board finds the medical evidence, such as the January 2024 DBQ, in which a professional with medical expertise examined the Veteran, completed necessary testing, acknowledged his reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of such disability in light of the rating criteria to be more persuasive than his own beliefs regarding the severity of such condition.

As the evidence of record shows no distinct period where the disability exhibited symptoms that would warrant higher evaluations than assigned, there is no basis to stage the rating. See Hart, 21 Vet. App. 505; Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126.

Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran did not have bilateral ankle and foot edema manifested by attacks without laryngeal involvement lasting one to seven days and occurring two to four times a year.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus is remanded. 

A January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral pes planus and assigned an initial 10 percent rating effective March 10, 2008. See Rating Decision (January 2024). This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the initial rating assigned. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024). Specifically, at his June 2018 VA examination, he reported last seeing his primary care manager for his pes planus one to two weeks prior, and that he did not seek treatment with a podiatrist. See C&P Exam (June 2018). He reported that he is beginning to develop calluses. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024). 

The rating review for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral pes planus begins on March 10, 2018-the date of the grant of service connection; and it ends on January 30, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The issue of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral pes planus is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.

VA's duty to assist includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency; and VA may end its efforts to obtain records if VA concludes that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain these records would be futile. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(c)(1)(C); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).

Here, prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, VA treatment records were associated with the claims file. See CAPRI (November 2021). These records included entries identifying after-visit summaries that were scanned into VA's electronic health records system, known as Veterans Health Information System Technology Architecture (VistA) Imaging system, on September 18, 2019, and April 2, 2021. See e.g., CAPRI at 54, 289 (November 2021). However, copies of these scanned records were not associated with the claim file prior to issuing the decision on appeal although they are in constructive receipt of VA. Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992). It is noted that these records are not otherwise associated with the claims file; and these records are constructively before the Board pursuant to Bell. See also Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (VA's duty to obtain VA treatment records, extends to obtaining sufficiently identified VA medical records or records of examination or treatment at non-VA facilities authorized by VA, regardless of their relevance).

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate copies of all treatment records from private treatment providers that have been scanned into the VistA Imaging system with the Veteran's claims folder, including from

(a.) September 18, 2019 (after-visit summary), and 

(b.) April 2, 2021 (after-visit summary).

Efforts to obtain these records must continue unless these records do not exist among the VistA systems records, which the AOJ should note in the claims file.
