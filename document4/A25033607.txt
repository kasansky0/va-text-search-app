ORDER

The claim for entitlement to a certificate of eligibility (COE) for VA home loan guaranty benefits is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The appellant served on active duty from August 1, 1990, to May 31, 1991.

2.  While on active duty, the appellant attended the US Air Force Academy Preparatory School and after approximately ten months, he was released from active duty.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The basic eligibility criteria for VA loan guaranty benefits have been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3701, 3702; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.315(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service in the United States Air Force from August 1, 1990, to May 31, 1991.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2023 letter decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (agency of original jurisdiction) (AOJ).

This claim has been processed pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Here, the appellant selected the direct review docket, meaning that the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a), 302(a).  

To establish eligibility for loan guaranty benefits, a veteran who initially enters service after September 7, 1980, must generally complete either 24 months of continuous active duty, or the full period for which he or she was called or ordered to active duty, whichever period is shorter (emphasis added).  38 U.S.C. § 5303A (b)(1).  There are exceptions to this general rule, which include in pertinent part: 1) where a veteran is discharged or released because of a service-connected disability, and; 2) where official service department records show that he or she had at the time of separation from service had a service-connected disability which in medical judgement would have warranted a discharge for disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.315 (b).

Here, the appellant entered onto active duty on August 1, 1990, and continued on active service until May 31, 1991.  The appellant's DD 214 indicates that when the appellant went onto active duty, he was attending the US Air Force Academy Prep School in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  At the end of the school year, he was subsequently discharged from service and was awarded an "Honorable" discharge.  The appellant's service is considered active duty for the purpose of establishing some veteran's benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(b)(5).  The appellant believes that this service qualifies him for a certificate of eligibility for a VA loan guaranty.  

VA guarantees loans made to eligible veterans by private lenders for the purchase of a dwelling to be owned and occupied by the veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 3710(a)(1).  A certificate of eligibility for loan guaranty benefits is granted only to veterans who satisfy the basic entitlement criteria outlined in 38 U.S.C. §§ 3701 and 3702, 38 C.F.R. § 3.315.  A person seeking VA benefits must first establish that they have attained the status of veteran.  Holmes v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 38, 40 (1997).  Eligibility for VA benefits is governed by statutory and regulatory law that defines an individual's legal status as a veteran of active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), 101(24), 3701; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6.

The term "veteran" means "a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released there from under conditions other than dishonorable."  38 U.S.C. § 101(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(d).  A discharge or release from active service under conditions other than dishonorable is a prerequisite to entitlement to VA pension or compensation benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 101(18); 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a).  The designation of the discharge as honorable by the service department is binding on VA as to character of discharge.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a).

As previously noted, to establish eligibility for home loan guaranty benefits, a veteran who initially enters service after September 7, 1980, must generally complete either 24 months of continuous active duty, or the full period for which he or she was called or ordered to active duty, whichever period is shorter.  38 U.S.C. § 5303A (b)(1).

Here the record does show that the appellant served less than 24 months and, as such, does not meet the minimum active service requirement.  Yet, the appellant did complete a full term of service for which he was called onto active duty while he was attending the Air Force Prep School.  He completed the full period of active duty he was ordered to complete.  Because this is an exception to the minimum active service requirement, the Board finds that his service meets the criteria to establish basic eligibility for VA home loan benefits and the appellant's claim is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 3702 (a)(2)(B), 5303A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.315 (b).
