CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left ankle disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a left foot disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1990 to August 1996.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The August 2024 rating decision was a Higher-Level Review of a previous May 2024 rating decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that less than one year has elapsed since September 2, 2024, the mailing of notice of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal. Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal prior to the expiration of the one-year period. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, as the Board herein grants the benefit sought on appeal in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding.

The Veteran asserts that his left ankle and left foot disabilities developed in service due to the wear and tear from field training exercises, training routines, and road marches on uneven surfaces while carrying heavy rucksacks. See October 2023 Statement in Support of Claim. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In this case, the AOJ has made a favorable finding that the Veteran has current diagnoses of left ankle post traumatic osteoarthritis, with osteoarthritis dissecans, and left foot plantar fasciitis with osteoarthritis and calcaneal spur. See August 2024 rating decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

The AOJ obtained a VA medical opinion in February 2024, directing a VA examiner to opine whether either of the Veteran's disabilities were due to the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) in service. While the examiner opined that the disabilities were not related to the Veteran's TERA, the examiner did state that the Veteran's disabilities were more likely caused due to direct wear and tear occurred in service, specifically due to the Veteran's job duties and physical training therein. 

Although the AOJ subsequently obtained a subsequent opinion in April 2024, the Board finds that the opinion is inadequate. In this regard, the April 2024 examiner did not consider the Veteran's statements regarding wear and tear and the gradual onset of symptoms, and rather based a negative opinion exclusively on a finding that there was no treatment in service for any foot or ankle issues. 

In light of the above, the Board finds that the evidence is at the very least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's left ankle and left foot disabilities had onset during his active service. The Board finds that the April 2024 VA opinion has limited probative value insofar as the examiner based the opinion on a lack of treatment in service, without consideration of the Veteran's statements as to the onset and progression of his symptoms. Conversely, the February 2024 VA examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements as to onset, finding that it was more likely than not based on those statements that the Veteran's disabilities onset in service. 

For these reasons, the Board will resolve all doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that entitlement to service connection for left ankle and left foot disabilities are granted.
