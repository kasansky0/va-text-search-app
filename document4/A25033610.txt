ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had sleep apnea at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1999 to October 2003.   

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Higher Level Review (HLR) rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, denied service connection for sleep apnea.  

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which he identified the issue as service connection for sleep apnea and elected the Direct Review docket.  

By way of history, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for sleep apnea in June 2022.  In a September 2022 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for sleep apnea.  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review options in a letter dated September 23, 2022.

In June 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review (HLR), seeking review of the September 2022 rating decision denying service connection for sleep apnea.  

In the October 2023 Higher Level Review rating decision referenced above, the RO again denied service connection for sleep apnea.  

In August 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on which he identified the issue as service connection for sleep apnea and elected the Direct Review docket.  Although the Veteran identified the September 2022 rating decision in the VA Form 10182, the appeal is not timely as to that decision, nor did the Veteran request an extension for good cause.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  However, because the Veteran clearly identified the issue he wished to appeal as entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, the Board will liberally construe it as a timely appeal of the October 2023 HLR rating decision.  

The October 2023 HLR rating decision was based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision.  Given this procedural history, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea is a symptom of his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  He has previously contended that "bad sleeping conditions and poor habits taught to me from the military have caused my obesity and sleep apnea."  See June 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall also be service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

After considering the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision, the Board concludes that service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted.  

As set forth above, the first element needed to establish service connection is evidence of a current disability.  In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of sleep apnea and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for complaints or findings of sleep apnea.  In June 2000 and June 2001, he completed Reports of Medical History on which he denied having, or ever having had, symptoms such as frequent trouble sleeping and easy fatiguability.  On a May 2003 Post-Deployment Health Assessment, the Veteran indicated that he did not have symptoms of feeling tired after sleeping, either currently or during his deployment.  

The post-service clinical evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 rating decision is similarly silent for complaints or findings of sleep apnea.  These records include an April 2017 treatment record showing that the Veteran was noted to have a history of nasal airway obstruction and chronic rhinosinusitis, status post tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy and endoscopic sinus surgery at the age of 15.  For the past five years, he had had persistent obstruction, congestion, snoring and mouth breathing which had become increasingly worse.  A CT scan showed a severe right septal deviation and adenoid hypertrophy.  The sinuses were clear and free of infection.  The Veteran was scheduled for a septoplasty, adenoidectomy and ear tube placement later that month which his clinician indicated would alleviate his nasal obstruction and increase air flow.  The post-operative diagnoses included severe right septal deviation, right interior turbinate hypertrophy, 100 percent obstruction of the posterior choanae with adenoidal tissue going back into the posterior choanae.   These records are negative for findings of sleep apnea, as are all post-service clinical records on file at the time of the September 2022 rating decision.  

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on which he sought service connection for numerous disabilities, including sleep apnea.  The VA Form 21-526EZ notified the Veteran of the evidence needed to support a claim of service connection, to include a current disability.  The form asked him to identify the names and locations of the facilities where he had received treatment for his claimed disabilities.  The Veteran provided an authorization for the release of records from a private physician who he indicated had treated him from 2008 to 2022.  The RO obtained records from this identified provider.  As discussed above, these records are negative for complaints or findings of sleep apnea.  

The Board therefore finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of sleep apnea and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Although the Veteran has filed a claim of service connection for sleep apnea, he has not provided evidence of a current disability.  The clinical evidence does not contain a diagnosis of sleep apnea, nor has the Veteran relayed a diagnosis of sleep apnea he received from a medical professional.  The Veteran himself is not competent to provide a diagnosis of sleep apnea.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education such as the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim but finds that one is not necessary because the record does not contain competent evidence of a diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).  Although the April 2017 treatment record noted snoring, the Veteran's clinician attributed that symptom to the Veteran's nasal airway obstruction.  There is no other competent evidence of a diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability in the record on appeal.

The Board also notes that the Veteran's service personnel records show that he served on the U.S.S. Bataan from August 2001 to October 2003, during which the ship was in the Arabian Sea.  Thus, he is a covered Veteran for purposes of the PACT Act.  See VBA Letter 20-24-06, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving Public Law 117-168, Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, or the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (adding the Arabian Sea to the locations delineated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2) for the purpose of eligibility for the presumptions of service connection in 38 U.S.C. § 1120).

The PACT Act requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected the veteran to participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1).  In this case, however, the record before the Board contains no evidence of a current disability.  Thus, an examination is not warranted.  

After consideration of the entire record on appeal, the Board concludes that the criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
