REMANDED

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person or housebound status (SMC-AA/HB) status is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1976 to November 1976, from November 2002 to November 2003, and from May 2007 to July 2008. The Veteran is in receipt of 100 percent rating, effective March 22, 2022, total disability based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), effective March 22, 2022, and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) (SMC K-1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a), effective March 22, 2022. 

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), seeking review of a July 2023 rating decision granting a noncompensable rating for migraine headaches, and denying service connection for erectile dysfunction and to a TDIU. During his February 2024 HLR informal conference, the Veteran expressed his disagreement with the denial of his claim, including that a 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines due to them being prostrating. See HLR - Informal Conference (February 2024). A February 2024 HLR duty to assist determination identified the lack of an adequate medical opinion addressing the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches, noting that the decision on his TDIU claim would be made after the development of his increased rating claim for migraines. See Rating Decision (February 2024); see also VA Form 20-0999 HLR Return (February 2024). As a result, the case was returned to the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) and assigned to the supplemental review lane for additional development. Following completion of the development, the AOJ issued an August 2024 decision on appeal, which increased the Veteran's rating to 50 percent for migraines and granted entitlement to a TDIU, both effective March 22, 2022. 

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Thus, the Board may only review evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Procedural & Factual Background

A July 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for migraines at noncompensable rating, effective March 22, 2022, and denied TDIU. See Rating Decision - Narrative (July 2023). In October 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, appealing the July 2023 rating decision as to the initial compensable rating for migraines and to entitlement to a TDIU. See VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (October 2023). In February 2024, an HLR informal conference was held and a HLR return was issued to obtain an examination as to the Veteran's claim for an initial compensable rating for migraines; TDIU was returned pending the development on the issue of an initial compensable rating for migraines. See HLR - Informal Conference, VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return, Rating Decision (February 2024). An August 2024 rating decision increased the Veteran's initial rating to 50 percent and granted entitlement to a TDIU, both effective March 22, 2022. See Rating Decision (August 2024). 

The Veteran is in receipt of a combined rating of 100 percent, effective March 22, 2022: Unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder (70%); migraines (50%); right knee strain (50%); cervical spine arthritis (20%); right hip pain syndrome (10%); right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain (10%); limitation of extension of thigh (9%); thigh impairment (0%); sinusitis (30%); tinnitus (10%); allergic rhinitis (10%); and bilateral hearing loss (0%). 

On his October 2022, VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran indicated that he had been unable to work due to his service-connected unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder ("PTSD/anxiety, insomnia"), sinusitis, rhinitis, migraines, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, cervical spine arthritis ("neck/spine"), and right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain ("ankle injuries"). He detailed that he was forced to stay home from work in 2016 due to severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and migraines, as well as due to lack of mobility and chronic pain in his neck and ankle. 

SMC: Legal Criteria

SMC based on the need for aid and attendance of another is payable when a veteran, due to service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, or is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

The VA considers the following criteria for determining whether a veteran is in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person: (1) the inability of the claimant to dress himself or herself or to keep himself or herself ordinarily clean and presentable; (2) frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which, by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without aid (not to include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); (3) the inability of the claimant to feed himself or herself through the loss of coordination of the upper extremities or through extreme weakness; (4) the inability to attend to the wants of nature; or, (5) a physical or mental incapacity that requires care and assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from the hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

"Bedridden," which is a proper basis for the determination, is defined as that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the veteran remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350(b)(4), 3.352(a).

It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that the veteran is so helpless, as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a); Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996) (it is logical to infer there is a threshold requirement that "at least one of the enumerated factors be present").

SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent, and, in addition has either: (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The permanently housebound criteria are met when the veteran is substantially confined to a residence, including ward or clinical areas if institutionalized, or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). Leaving one's residence for medical purposes cannot, by itself, serve as the basis for finding the veteran is not substantially confined for benefit purposes. Howell v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 535, 540 (2006).

In Bradley v. Peake, the Court of Appeals of Veterans Claims held that a grant of TDIU based on a single disability constitutes a "service-connected disability rated as total" for purposes of meeting the initial criteria for permanent housebound benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 1114(s). Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293. A TDIU rating based on multiple disabilities will not satisfy the initial 100 percent rating requirement. Id. Additionally, the single disability that satisfies the 100 percent (total) rating requirement must be separate and distinct from the additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more. Id. 

Entitlement to SMC is remanded.

The Board may only remand an AMA appeal to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal; or alternatively, for any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The issue of entitlement to SMC is remanded pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

First, the August 2024 rating decision improperly limited the scope of the claim to SMC K-1 and failed to adjudicate the issue of entitlement to SMC, including SMC-AA/HB, which was reasonably raised at that time. There is a reasonable possibility of aiding the Veteran in substantiating this claim given that the Veteran has provided reports detailed above of being substantially confined to his residence due to a service-connected disabilities, including mental and physical limitations due to service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Second, prior to the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, the evidence of record included the Veteran's application for Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits as well as medical treatment records. See Medical Treatment Records - Furnished by SSA (February 2023). A February 2023 SSA inquiry reflects that the Veteran is in receipt of Title II SSA benefits (indicating that he may be in receipt of SSA disability benefits) from March 2022. However, the decision on the Veteran's application for SSA benefits is not in his VA record. VA's duty to assist includes obtaining such records in Federal custody. See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363 (1992).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request and obtain from the SSA all relevant documents (as indicated to have been in existence prior to the August 2024 AOJ decision) pertaining to any applications by the Veteran for SSA disability benefits, including any decisions and/or determinations, and supporting medical documentation utilized in rendering any relevant decision or determination. Any negative search result should be noted in the record and communicated to the Veteran.

2. Adjudicate the Veteran's claim for SMC in the first instance.
