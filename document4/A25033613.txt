ORDER

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied. 

Service connection for lumbar spine disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosis, to include PTSD, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability began during active service, or it is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability had its onset during any period of active duty for training (ADT); resulted from a disease during any period of ADT; or is a result of an injury incurred, or aggravated in, during any period of ADT or inactive duty training (IDT).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 4.125.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.6.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2019 to November 2019, April 2020 to August 2020, and in January 2021; the Veteran has additional periods of Guard and Reserve Active Service (GRAS). A completed period of GRAS qualifies a person for eligibility consideration for any Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefit, subject to the application of all other appropriate VA rules or regulations. 38 U.S.C. § 101(2).

The decision on appeal was issued on March 5, 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act, applies.

On the May 17, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like the VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Compensation may be awarded for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.303(a), (d).

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. 

The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of service in the National Guard. See VA Form 21-0781 (October 2023).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability (i.e., a diagnosis conforming to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5)) that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). The Federal Circuit has held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.125 and 4.130 unambiguously require a formal DSM-5 diagnosis as a pre-condition for service connection for a mental condition. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022). 

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, such as PTSD, first requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. 

§ 4.125(a). Stated another way, there must be a diagnosis that conforms to the DSM-5 for service connection to be awarded. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.125(a), 4.130; see Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 401 (2020) ("[W]e hold that the plain language of § 4.130 requires a DSM-5 diagnosis to compensate a psychiatric disability and that... § 4.125(a)... requires the same."), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon, 28 F.4th at 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) ("[We] conclude that a DSM-5 diagnosis is required for service connection to be awarded under § 4.130.").

Here, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has, or has had, a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, in accordance with the DSM-5. In this regard, service treatment record (STR), dated in January 2023, reflects that the Veteran underwent an annual periodic health assessment (PHA). On the behavioral health section, the Veteran denied, among other things, receiving, in the past year, care for any mental health condition or concern such as, but not limited to, PTSD, depression, anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse, or substance abuse. The PHA also reveals that the Veteran was examined by a medical professional that found no current mental health issue or concern and that referral to mental health specialty care was not required. Additionally, the record is absent of post-service medical records containing complaints, reports, treatment, or a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, pursuant to DSM-5 criteria. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that he has PTSD due to service in the National Guard. However, although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011), the diagnosis of a specific psychiatric condition, such as PTSD, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Establishing an acquired psychiatric disorder diagnosis as a disability for VA purposes requires diagnostic testing and a diagnosis conforming to the diagnostic criteria set forth in the DSM-5. See 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 4.125, 4.130. See also, Martinez-Boden, 32 Vet. App. 393 (holding that a diagnosis under DSM-5 is required for compensation for psychiatric disabilities). In this regard, the Veteran has not been shown to possess the medical expertise or knowledge required to diagnose a disability such as PTSD, and such statements do not constitute competent evidence of a diagnosis of any acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, conforming to the DSM-5.

As there is not competent evidence of an acquired psychiatric disorder, there can be no valid claim. The first element of service connection is not met.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. 

§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to service connection for lumbar spine disability.

The Veteran contends that service connection for lumbar spine disability is warranted. Specifically, the Veteran argues that during a training exercise with a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, in 2019, he injured his back. See VA Form 21-546EZ (October 2023).

The March 2024 decision on appeal found that the Veteran indicated, on a March 2018 and January 2019 health assessment, recurring muscle joint or low back pain. This is a favorable finding by the AOJ. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. 

§ 3.104(c).

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has current diagnoses of thoracolumbar and lumbosacral strains, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability began during active service, or it is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

The Board also finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability had its onset during any period of ADT; resulted from a disease during any period of ADT; or is a result of an injury incurred, or aggravated in, during any period of ADT or IDT.

Active service and National Guard STRs do not reflect complaints, treatment, symptoms or signs for a chronic lumbar spine disability. In this regard, the Veteran's STRs show that he underwent several comprehensive annual PHAs. A review of the PHAs, however, show that the Veteran, on multiple times, denied or did not report recurring muscle, joint, or low back pain. Additionally, the PHAs show that the Veteran denied or did not report any back injury, illness, or disease which was incurred or aggravated while in a duty status since his last PHA. Moreover, although the Veteran indicated, on the March 2018 and January 2019 PHAs, recurring muscle, joint, or low back pain, the PHAs do not reveal that such symptoms had their onset during, or are related to an injury, disease, or event, active service, ADT, or IDT. Indeed, on the March 2018 and January 2019 PHAs, the Veteran denied having a spine or back injury, illness, or disease which was incurred or aggravated while in a duty status since his last PHA. Further, the PHAs show that the Veteran was evaluated by a medical professional; and after examination and/or records review, the examiner found no identifiable issue or concern that required referral to another medical clinic, such as physical therapy. For example, PHAs, dated in January 2020 and October 2020, following the alleged 2019 back injury, show that the Veteran denied or did not report recurring muscle, joint, or low back pain; and having injury, illness, or disease which was incurred or aggravated while in a duty status since his last PHA. The January 2020 and October 2020 PHAs also show that the medical examiner made no referral as there were no identifiable back or spine medical issues or concerns.

VA-obtained examination report, dated in February 2024, shows that the Veteran reported the 2019 training exercise, in which, he injured his back. He was diagnosed with thoracolumbar and lumbosacral strains.

The Board acknowledges the lay statements of record. While lay persons are competent to describe observable symptomology (e.g., back pain), the Veteran is not competent to opine on the etiology of such symptoms given that his disability was not shown as incurring during service and because he lacks the requisite medical expertise to formulate a medical opinion on whether his current lumbar spine disability had its onset in service or is related to an in-service injury or disease. This is a complex medical determination beyond the range of experience or understanding of the lay person that cannot be answered based on observation or analysis of the lay person. Indeed, this is an intricate and complex matter that requires specialized medical education and knowledge, separate from the training, education, or knowledge of a lay person, regarding the unseen and complex processes of the development of musculoskeletal disabilities. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (although it is error to categorically reject a non-expert opinion as to etiology, or nexus, not all questions of nexus are subject to non-expert opinion; whether a layperson is competent to provide a nexus opinion depends on the facts of the particular case). Therefore, as the Veteran is not competent to provide an opinion, the Board finds his opinion of no probative value in this matter.

Further, given that a spine or back medical issue could have impacted the Veteran's ability to deploy with his unit, the Board finds that it would ordinarily have been recorded in the STRs. The Veteran's STRs, nevertheless, reflect no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for a chronic spine disability. Indeed, as mentioned above, after multiple examinations, the examining medical providers found no identifiable medical issue or concern regarding the back or spine that required referral to another medical clinic or specialty. 

Next, with regard to the Veteran's period of service in the National Guard, the Board emphasizes the more restrictive requirements applicable to periods of ADT and IDT as compared to active-duty service. The law applicable to active-duty service establishes "veteran" status without further requirements. Moreover, it permits a grant of service connection simply by evidence establishing an etiological relationship between an injury or disease in service and a post-service disability. The law pertaining to periods of ADT and IDT requires that the claimant have become disabled "during" the period of ADT or IDT in which the injury or disease occurred, and specifically requires that the disease and/or injury have been incurred in the line of duty. Moreover, the claimant bears the burden of establishing that this sequence of events has occurred before "veteran" status is granted. 

38 U.S.C. § 101(24). In other words, simply reporting that a disability is due to a training exercise, during a period of ADT or IDT, is not sufficient to establish entitlement to service connection for such a period. It must be established that the disability had its onset during the period of ADT or IDT in question, and that it was due to an injury or disease incurred in the line of duty. Here, the onset of the lumbar spine disability does not appear to have occurred during a period of ADT or IDT, as discussed above. 

Given the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability began during active service, or it is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. In making this determination, the Board takes notice that the weight of the evidence demonstrates no onset of a lumbar spine disability during active service, or an in-service injury or disease to which the lumbar spine disability could be related. The Board assigns greater probative value to the objective medical evidence, to include the Veteran's STRs, reflecting no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for a chronic spine disability or disorder. See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than history as reported by the claimant); Forshey v. West, 12 Vet. App. 71, 74 (1998), aff'd sub nom., Forshey v. Principi, 284 F.3d 1335, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding that the definition of evidence encompasses "negative evidence" which tends to disprove the existence of an alleged fact).

The Board also finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability had its onset during any period of ADT; resulted from a disease during any period of ADT; or is a result of an injury incurred, or aggravated in, during any period of ADT or IDT. In making this determination, the Board observes that the Veteran, aside from identifying the year of 2019 as the date of the alleged back injury, has not identified any specific period of ADT and/or IDT which caused his current lumbar spine disability. See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (noting the claimant's general evidentiary burden to establish his claim); see also Skoczen v. Shinseki, 564 F.3d 1319, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (interpreting section 5107 and stating that a claimant has the burden of presenting evidence supporting his or her claim, albeit with the statutorily mandated assistance of VA). 

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. 

§ 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Lastly, the AOJ obtained a medical opinion in this matter based on the Veteran report on the March 2018 and January 2019 PHAs of recurring muscle joint or low back pain. However, the Board finds that the AOJ had no duty to obtain an examination or opinion in this matter because the weight of the evidence demonstrates no in-service disease, injury, or event during active service, ADT, or IDT. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-82 (2006). Although generally VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). But here, there is no reasonable possibility that there could be an adequate medical opinion that would help substantiate the appeal because there is no in-service injury or disease to which an opinion could relate the diagnosed lumbar spine disability. See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010). In other words, any opinion purporting to relate the currently diagnosed lumbar spine disability to service would have to base such opinion on a factually inaccurate assumption of in-service injury, disease, or event; such factually inaccurate assumption would render the purported opinion of no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual basis is of no probative value). Notably, the Veteran's report of back symptoms in both in 2018 and 2019 predates his period of active duty service from August 2019 to November 2019; and on his GRAS health assessments dated January 2020, October 2020, March 2022, and January 2023he denied recurring muscle, joint, or low back pain. Likewise, the Veteran denied having injury, illness, or disease which was incurred or aggravated while in a duty status since his last PHA on health assessments dated March 2018, January 2019, January 2020, October 2020, March 2022, and January 2023. Thus, although the Veteran established the first element of service connection-a current disability, he has not established that there was incurrence of injury during a period of active duty, ADT, or IDT service. Therefore, an adequate opinion is not possible. See Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (strict adherence to requirements of law is not warranted when adherence would result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran).
