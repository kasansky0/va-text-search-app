DOCKET NO. 210609-165025
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to an increased disability rating and earlier effective date for migraine headaches, increased disability rating and earlier effective date for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and entitlement to total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 6, 2022, and April 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from June 2008 to October 2017.

The matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

On September 6, 2022, and again on April 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R.  

§ 20.205(b)(1).

Here, the Veteran filed a "Statement in Support of Claim" on September 6, 2022, which included the Veteran's name, Social Security number, and the following statement: "I would like to withdraw the issues of evaluation and effective date of migraine headaches, evaluation and effective date for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and individual unemployability which were appealed to the Board . . . on 06/09/2021." See September 2022 VA 21-4138. On April 2, 2024, the Veteran again contacted VA to withdraw his claims, noting the appropriate docket number assigned to this matter and reiterating an "intent to withdraw the above claim." See also April 2024 VA 27-0820.

Thus, the issues on appeal have been validly withdrawn and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
