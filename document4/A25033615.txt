DOCKET NO. 230726-366437
DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

The appeal seeking service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for treatment purposes only under to 38 U.S.C §§ 1701-1789 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 12, 2023, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran in writing that he wished to withdrawal the present appeal seeking service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes only.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of a July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) by the Veteran as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes only have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1978 to February 1982.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The July 2023 rating decision denied service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C §§ 1701-1789.

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (notice of disagreement) the Veteran appealed the denial of service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes, and he elected the Hearing docket.  The Board had not scheduled the Veteran for a hearing prior to receipt of his December 2023request to withdraw the present appeal.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by an appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran requested to withdraw the present appeal seeking service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes in writing on December 12, 2023, as well as on a July 3, 3024 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran also contacted VA by phone requesting to withdraw the present appeal.  See October 2024 VA Form 27-0820, Report of General Information.  As the Veteran has satisfied the requirements for withdrawal outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal seeking service connection for PTSD for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C §§ 1701-1789 is dismissed.
