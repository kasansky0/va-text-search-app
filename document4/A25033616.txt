REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2003 to December 2008.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 16, 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The rating decision assigned a 40 percent rating for the back disability and granted service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities, both effective January 18, 2024.  On August 28, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.  In the Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran specifically noted that he was contesting the effective date for the back and lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  

On August 29, 2024, during the pendency of this appeal, the RO issued another rating decision, finding that the correct effective date for the 40 percent rating for the back disability was September 1, 2023 and the correct effective date for service connection for the bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities was June 1, 2023.  The assignment of the effective date for the rating for the back disability was based on receipt of a VA Form 21-526 EZ Claim for Compensation seeking an increased disability rating for the back disability on September 1, 2023.  The assignment of the effective date for the service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities was based on evidence that radiculopathy was diagnosed on June 1, 2023, within a year of the September 1, 2023 claim. 

In issuing the August 29, 2024 rating decision changing the effective date for evaluation of the back disability and service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, the RO superseded the rating decision on appeal, effectively rendering the earlier rating decision moot.  Accordingly, the appeal is also moot.  Further, the Board notes that the August 29, 2024 rating decision reflects a full grant of the relief requested by the Veteran, as the effective dates assigned are the earliest possible effective dates to which the Veteran would be entitled.   

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For an increased rating claim, VA regulations allow for the assignment of an increased rating up to one year prior to receipt of a formal claim for increase, when it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Here, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526 EZ Claim for Compensation seeking an increased disability rating for the back disability on September 1, 2023.  That claim was adjudicated in a January 2024 rating decision that denied the claim.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review (HLR) challenging the January 2023 rating decision.  In a May 2024 rating decision addressing the HLR, the RO ordered a new examination to evaluate the back disability.   Following that examination, the RO issued the August 16, 2024 rating decision on appeal, assigning a 40 percent rating for the back disability effective January 18, 2024 and granting service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy effective the same date.  

The Board finds that September 1, 2023 is the appropriate date available for assignment of the increased rating claim for the back disability, as the Veteran continuously pursued that claim until the rating decision on appeal.  The record does not reflect, and the Veteran does not contend, that it was factually ascertainable that the increased disability occurred within a year of the filing of the claim.  Also, a claim for an increased rating on VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit, regardless of whether it was received within one year of the issuance of the prior VA decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Nor does the record reflect that an intent to file was received within a year prior to the September 2, 2023 claim. 

With respect to radiculopathy, the record reflects that it was factually ascertainable that the condition occurred within a year of the receipt of the September 1, 2023 claim.  Specifically, VA treatment records include a June 1, 2023 "Physical Medicine Rehab Consult" during which the Veteran complained of low back pain and reported that he currently experienced bilateral radiation of tingling to his hamstrings and lateral thighs.  The Veteran was assessed with low back pain due to degenerative disc disease and radiculopathy.  As June 1, 2023 is within a year of the claim for an increased rating for the back disability, it is the appropriate effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).    

Therefore, the Board finds that because the August 29, 2024 rating decision effectively replaced the decision from which the Veteran appealed and because the decision represents a full grant of the available benefits sought on appeal, there remains no justiciable case or controversy with respect to this appeal.  Accordingly, the appeal is moot and must be dismissed. See, e.g., Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 224-225 (2006); Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992) (When the relief sought has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the matter as moot).
