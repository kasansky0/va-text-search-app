The appeal of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred on February 3, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received a written statement from the Veteran dated April 8, 2025, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (for AMA) § 19.55 (legacy).  In this case, the Veteran, in a written statement received by the Board on April 8, 2025, withdrew this appeal in its entirety.  Hence, the appeal is dismissed.
