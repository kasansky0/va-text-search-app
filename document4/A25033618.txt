ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA is not related to an in-service injury or disease and is not otherwise secondary to her service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA due to service or the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1975 to August 1979.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2022 decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)

The Veteran contends her OSA is due to stress in service or secondary to her service-connected disabilities.  See June 2021 Fully Developed Claim.  

The Board will first address whether direct service connection is warranted.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's current OSA began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The October 2023 rating decision made the favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with sleep apnea since October 2009 and the primary disabilities of hysterectomy, back disability, left ovary removal, pain disorder, endometriosis with D&C, status post laparoscopy, and left breast fibrocystic disease are service-connected.

The Veteran's service treatment records, including her separation examination, are silent for complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of OSA.  Her separation examination does note that since her diagnosis and hospitalization for mononucleosis in 1976, the Veteran reported still feeling tired. 

After service, the Veteran's VA treatment records show she was not diagnosed with OSA until 2009, 30 years after separation from service.  The Veteran also reported to the July 2021 VA examiner that her OSA did not onset until 2009.

The Board finds a VA opinion under the standards of McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006) is not warranted in this case.  There is no credible, probative evidence suggesting a relationship between active-duty service and the OSA.  Therefore, the Board finds that the duty to assist was not invoked, even under McLendon, as here the evidence fails the McLendon analysis for this claim.  A mere conclusory generalized statement that a service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (discussing the circumstances when a VA examination and opinion are required).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes her OSA is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include stress.  The Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the medical evidence of record.

Based on a careful review of the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding service connection for OSA on a direct basis is warranted.

Therefore, entitlement to service connection for OSA on a direct basis is denied.

The Board will now address whether service connection is warranted on a secondary basis.

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is secondary to a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

A VA opinion was obtained in July 2021.  First, the VA examiner clarified that the Veteran's claimed sleep disturbances were symptoms of her major depressive disorder and not a separate diagnosis.  Second, the VA examiner opined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was secondary to her left breast fibrocystic disease, degenerative disc disease, laparoscopy, hysterectomy, left ovary removal, and endometriosis.  The rationale was that these conditions are not medically related and are separate entities.  The examiner explained that a thorough review of the medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship.  Third, the VA examiner opined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was secondary to her somatic symptom disorder.  The examiner instead attributed the Veteran's OSA to her weight as her BMI was approximately 34 which is considered obese.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's sleep apnea was due to her weight and not due to a psychological factor.

The Board finds the July 2021 VA opinion to be highly probative as it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes her OSA is secondary to her service-connected disabilities.  However, the Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the skills or medical training to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the objective medical evidence including the July 2021 VA opinion. 

Based on a careful review of the subjective and clinical evidence, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that service connection for OSA on a secondary basis is warranted.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for OSA secondary to the Veteran's service-connected disabilities is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
