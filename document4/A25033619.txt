REASONS FOR REMAND

This appeal has a long procedural history stemming from the Veteran's August 2015 claim of entitlement to service connection for a back injury that was granted with assigned ratings for his associated lower left extremity radiculopathy disabilities that have been continuously pursued since.  See August 2015 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2022 Board Decision; September 2022 Rating Decision; July 2024 Rating Decision; November 2024 Board Decision; December 2024 Rating Decision; December 2024 VA Form 10182.

The December 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the December 2024 VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the above claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran's December 2024 VA Form 10182 is liberally construed as an appeal of the December 2024 rating decision's denial of a compensable rating for his service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the external cutaneous nerve.  The Veteran appealed the December 2024 rating decision's denial of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the "common peroneal nerve, claimed as external cutaneous nerve."  However, the December 2024 rating decision adjudicated the assigned rating for the Veteran's external cutaneous nerve, not his common peroneal nerve.  The Veteran is also not currently entitled to service connection for a common peroneal nerve disability.  The Board construed this appeal as, instead, an appeal of the noncompensable rating assigned to his external cutaneous nerve.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).

1. Issue of entitlement to higher initial disability ratings for left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the sciatic nerve, currently rated as 20 percent disabling from August 12, 2015, to September 27, 2023; 40 percent disabling from September 27, 2023, to February 26, 2024; and 60 percent disabling since February 26, 2024, is remanded.

2. Issue of entitlement to higher initial disability ratings for left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the femoral nerve, currently rated as 10 percent disabling from August 12, 2015, to April 17, 2023, and 30 percent disabling since April 17, 2023, is remanded.

3. Issue of entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the external cutaneous nerve of thigh is remanded.

The Board finds a remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the December 2024 rating decision on appeal.

The criteria for rating disabilities involving the sciatic, femoral, and external cutaneous nerves do not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8520, 8526, and 8529.  But the evidence of record shows the Veteran has been prescribed medications that include cyclobenzaprine, hydrocodone, meloxicam, and acetaminophen for his medical conditions.  See, e.g., December 2016 VA treatment evidence; January 2017 VA treatment evidence; April 2023 VA treatment evidence.  He reported that at least some of these medications were for his service-connected lumbar intervertebral disc syndrome symptoms.  See November 2023 VA Examination for Back Conditions.  But it is unclear whether these medications had any ameliorative effect on the severity of symptoms from his service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the sciatic, femoral, and external cutaneous nerves.  The Board finds a medical opinion from a VA examiner is needed as to whether the Veteran's prescribed and over-the-counter medications had any ameliorative effects on his left lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms and, if so, how it affects his symptoms.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate medical professional to determine the severity of the Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the sciatic, femoral, and external cutaneous nerves during the entire period on appeal from August 12, 2015, including any ameliorative effects of prescribed and over-the-counter medication(s).  If the medical professional determines that it is necessary, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria.  

The medical professional should also specifically respond to the following:

(a) Identify the prescribed or over-the-counter medication(s) used by the Veteran during the period on appeal since August 12, 2015, used for his back or left lower extremity radiculopathy symptoms.

(b) Do the identified medications for either his back or left lower extremity radiculopathy have ameliorative effects on the Veteran's symptoms from his left lower extremity radiculopathy involving the sciatic, femoral, or external cutaneous nerves, including pain, paresthesias, dysesthesias, numbness, muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation.  If so, describe the Veteran's radiculopathy symptoms for his sciatic, femoral, or external cutaneous nerves, noting any increase or decrease in symptoms since August 12, 2015.

(c) If it is not possible to provide an estimate of his radiculopathy symptoms without resorting to mere speculation, the medical professional must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the medical professional does not have the knowledge or training to do so.
