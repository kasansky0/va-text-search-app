ORDER

Entitlement to a restoration of 60 percent for service-connected coronary artery disease with valvular heart disease, implanted cardiac pacemaker, and sick sinus syndrome with sinus bradycardia (previously rated as ischemic heart disease) (hereinafter collectively referred to as coronary artery disease), is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability  (TDIU) is granted as of March 9, 2018.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 USC Chapter 35 is granted as of March 9, 2018.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a January 2022 rating decision, the regional office (RO) reduced the disability rating for service-connected coronary artery disease from 60 percent to 30 percent; the reduction was improper as the medical evidence of record does not show actual improvement of the Veteran's condition.

2. The Veteran had been unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation solely by reason of his service-connected disabilities since March 9, 2018.

3. The Veteran's award of DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is predicated on the award of a TDIU, which, pursuant to this decision, is effective March 9, 2018.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Reduction in evaluation of coronary artery disease, from 60 percent disabling to 30 percent disabling was improper, and the 60 percent disability rating is restored. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.105, 3.159, 3.344, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.75-4.79.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 9, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 9, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3510, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to March 1973.  The Veteran passed away in July 2023, and the Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The AMA creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Although the VA Form 10182 was not timely, the Board found that good cause had been submitted for an extension of time to submit the VA Form 10182. See March 2025 Board letter.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a restoration of 60 percent rating for service-connected coronary artery disease 

The Veteran contended that the reduction of the rating for his service-connected coronary artery disease from 60 percent to 30 percent was improper.  The Appellant maintains this assertion.

The Veteran was awarded entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease in a June 2018 rating decision, rated as 30 percent disabling effective March 2018. In a March 2021 rating decision, the Veteran's rating was increased to 60 percent for coronary artery disease effective November 25, 2020.  In a January 2022 rating decision, the Veteran's rating was reduced to 30 percent for his service-connected coronary artery disease.  The January 2022 rating decision noted due process under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 was not required because his overall combined evaluation was not changed by the reduction.

The Board notes the RO did not issue the Veteran a rating decision proposing the reduced rating; however, such notice is not required as indicated by the RO in the January 2022 rating decision.  Where a reduced rating would not result in a decrease or discontinuance of current compensation payments, there are no due process procedural requirements.  See VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 1991).  At the time the RO issued the January 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was receiving a combined compensation rate of 90 percent.  Despite the reduced disability ratings for his coronary artery disease, the Veteran's overall disability rate remained at 90 percent.  As such, the notice and due process requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) are not required in this case.

Therefore, the remaining question is whether the reduction of the disability rating was proper.

In this case, the Veteran's 60 percent rating for coronary artery disease had been in effect since November 2020. Ratings in effect for less than five years may be reduced based on reexaminations disclosing physical or mental improvement in the disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c).

A rating reduction is not proper unless a veteran's disability shows actual improvement in his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000). In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the RO at the time the reduction was effectuated (although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of considering whether actual improvement was demonstrated). Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992).

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. For the period at issue, the Veteran's heart disability is rated under the criteria found at 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005.

Effective November 14, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005.  86 Fed. Reg. 54089 (Sep. 30, 2021).  This amended regulation applies to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 14, 2021.  Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both the pre- and post-amendment rating criteria, and whichever is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.  However, the Board may not apply the post-amendment rating criteria to a period prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).  Conversely, the Board is not precluded from applying the pre-amendment rating criteria to a period on or after the effective date of the post-amendment rating criteria so long as it was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005, for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) a 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 5.0 METs but not greater than 7.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray.  A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; a workload of greater than 3.0 METs but not greater than 5.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic congestive heart failure, or; a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent.

Under the pre-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used.  Id.

For the purposes of a 60 percent evaluation, the pre-amendment rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent.  Otero-Castro v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 375, 382 (2002).  Additionally, the phrase "30 to 50 percent" means 30 percent through 50 percent.  Id. at 380.

Effective November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005, arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart.  A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).  A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.  A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

Under the post-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).  When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used.  Id.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2021 and reported symptoms of intermittent dizziness, weakness, and dyspnea depending on his heart rate.  The examiner noted he had an implanted cardiac pacemaker placed on January 10, 2019, for his sick sinus syndrome with intermittent bradycardia and tachycardia.  The examiner also noted his February 2021 echocardiogram revealed cardiac dilatation, left ventricular ejection fraction of 55 to 60 percent, and abnormal wall thickness with left ventricular hypertrophy. The examination revealed a workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs which resulted in dyspnea and fatigue.  The examiner opined his functional impact as a result of his cardiac conditions was he could only do light office type work due to complaints of intermittent dizziness, weakness, and dyspnea depending on his heart rate.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2021. The Veteran reported intermittent episodes of chest pain, dyspnea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and fatigue on mild exertion, similar to his symptoms when they began in 2018.  He reported the impact of his condition on his ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities was that he was unable to perform mild to moderate exertion.  The VA examiner noted cardiac dilation on the February 2021 echocardiogram with 55-60 percent ejection fraction and abnormal wall thickness of left ventricular hypertrophy.  The examination revealed a workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs which resulted in dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness.  The examiner noted the functional impact of his cardiac condition was limited ability to perform tasks requiring prolonged walking and standing, repetitive heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, bending, and kneeling due to symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, and shortness of breath on mild to moderate exertion.

This case turns on whether the evidence shows actual improvement in everyday life. Overall, the lay and medical evidence of record, namely the Veteran's statements and the January and October 2021 VA examinations, does not reveal actual improvement in the disability under the conditions of ordinary life and work. Instead, the evidence indicates that the Veteran's symptoms have persisted. 

After resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease has not shown actual improvement. As a result, the Board finds that the reduction was in error, and the prior 60 percent rating is restored. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability 

The Veteran was awarded TDIU, effective November 25, 2020, corresponding to the effective date the Veteran's rating was increased to 60 percent for coronary artery disease.

TDIU is authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities where the schedular rating is less than total, and the claimant is unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment because of the severity of service-connected disabilities. If there is only one such disability, it must be rated as at least 60 percent. If two or more disabilities, at least one must be rated as at least 40 percent disabling, with sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.15, 4.16(a).

For a TDIU, the critical question is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are sufficient to cause unemployability, not any nonservice-connected condition. See Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Other factors that may receive consideration include his employment history, level of education and vocational attainment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 ; see also Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 331-32 (1991).

The Board notes the Veteran filed for TDIU in July 2018.  However, during the period on appeal for a service connection and a higher rating for his coronary artery disease since March 9, 2018, the Veteran reported he was both unemployed and previously worked as a mechanic.  He reported that his tinea pedis caused a burning painful sensation in his feet and his functional impact from this condition was pain on weight bearing, swelling, interference with standing, and lack of endurance.  He reported he had been unable to work due to his PTSD, coronary artery disease, and foot impairment.  The Veteran indicated in 2018 that he worked as a self-employed mechanic in 2010 but had time lost at work of 6 to 8 months.  In light of such evidence, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to TDIU has been raised in connection with the pending claim on appeal for service connection and then a higher rating for service-connected coronary artery disease.  As a result, the date of claim for entitlement to a TDIU was also on March 9, 2018.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

In a March 2021 rating decision, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was granted effective November 25, 2020.  Thus, the issue during the appeal period prior to November 25, 2020 (March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020) remains on appeal and is characterized accordingly.

As of this date, with regards to the period on appeal from March 9, 2018 to November 24, 2020, the Veteran was service connected for the following: (i) PTSD (70 percent from March 9, 2018); (ii) tinea pedis, bilateral feet (30 percent from August 7, 2014); (iii) coronary artery disease (30 percent from March 9, 2018 to November 24, 2020); (iv) status post fistulous tract, right jaw (0 percent from January 25, 1983); and (v) scar, left upper anterior chest (0 percent from January 10, 2019).

With regard to the period on appeal of March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020, the combined disability evaluation is 90 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  As a result, the Veteran meets the minimum percent requirements for consideration of a TDIU on a schedular basis during the appeal period from March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020.  See 38 C.F.R. 4.16(a).

The Board considers whether there is evidence to warrant TDIU on a schedular basis, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), at any time from March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020.

The Veteran reported a high school education with two years of college and a mechanic certification, and past work experience as a self-employed mechanic.  The Veteran's military occupation specialty was a tracked vehicle repairman and motor vehicle operator.  The Veteran indicated he became too disabled to work as of December 2010.

VA examination reports and treatment records noted multiple functional impairments related to his service-connected disabilities.  With respect to the Veteran's PTSD, the April 2018 VA examination found occasional decrease in work efficiency, and that disturbances caused clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  The VA examiner noted symptoms of avoidance, persistent negative beliefs, persistent, distorted cognitions, markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, irritable behavior and angry outbursts, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbance.  The August 2018 psychological VA examination found occasional decreases in work efficiency and symptoms of depressed mood, chronic anxiety, panic attacks, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, social isolation, anger, flashbacks, nightmares, restricted range of mood, avoidance, loss of interest, hypervigilance, and difficulties focusing and concentrating.  The Veteran reported that he had a shop where his wife would work up front with customers, and he repaired radiators in the back.  He indicated he was able to take breaks as needed and work in a corner.  In terms of the criteria for PTSD, the VA examiner found he had clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as well as markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.  In October 2018, VA treatment records indicate PTSD symptoms of trauma from flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance, repetitive recall of trauma, social and emotional withdrawal, isolation, dissociative episodes, and symptoms of increased autonomic arousal.  In May 2019, he reported difficulty sleeping due to increased anxiety and racing thoughts at night.    

With respect to his service-connected tinea pedis, the April 2018 VA examination noted symptoms of burning, painful sensation in the feet bilaterally, and functional impact of pain on weight bearing, swelling, interference with standing, and lack of endurance.   The Veteran was treated in the hospital in March 2018 for foot swelling and pain.  The July 2018 VA disability benefits questionnaire for tinea pedis indicated the impact on his ability to work is from rashes which cause the skin to crack open and bleed and can be easily infected.  The VA examiner indicated this impacts his ability to stand and walk.  

With respect to the Veteran's coronary artery disease, the April 2018 VA examination noted symptoms of left leg weakness and foot drop with decreased strength in the left upper extremity, dyspnea with exertion and fatigue, and a few falls from syncope episodes requiring hospitalization.   In early October 2018, the Veteran was hospitalized for chest pain and dizziness ongoing for 6 hours as well as chest pressure that worsened with sitting and standing.  He was hospitalized again in late October 2018 for chest pain and irregular heartbeat.  He was treated again in the emergency room in December 2018 for dizziness, irregular heartbeat, and lightheadedness.  The March 2019 VA examination for his heart conditions noted current symptoms of fatigue on exertion with recent placement of a pacemaker in January 2019.  The examiner determined he could not do heavy labor or exercise.  In April 2019, he was treated for fluttering symptoms.  

Given the Veteran's education and occupational history, and the severity of his service-connected conditions, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record indicates that these service-connected disabilities, combined, rendered him unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment from March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020. "[W]hen the Board conducts a TDIU analysis, it must take into account veteran's education, training, and work history." Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 276, 286 (2015).  Accordingly, the issue of entitlement to TDIU is granted on a schedular basis effective March 9, 2018, to November 24, 2020.  See38 C.F.R.  §§ 3.102, 4.16a.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35

The Veteran was awarded DEA benefits under Chapter 35 effective November 25, 2020. Similar to the discussion above, the Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the DEA award.

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807 (a), 21.3021. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

The criteria pertaining to the award of educational benefits provides that for effective dates assigned following the grant of benefits under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to the effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

As discussed in this decision, the Veteran has been granted an effective date of March 9, 2018, for the award of a TDIU.

As the Veteran has been granted an earlier effective date for the award of a TDIU, an earlier effective date for the award of DEA benefits is also warranted in this case. The earliest possible effective date for DEA benefits is March 9, 2018, the newly assigned effective date for the award of a TDIU. Accordingly, an earlier effective date of March 9, 2018, for the assignment of DEA benefits is granted.
