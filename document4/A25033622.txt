ORDER

Entitlement to an initial 50 percent evaluation, but no higher, for migraine headaches throughout the appeal period is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's migraine headaches have more nearly approximated frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks capable of producing severe economic inadaptability. 

2.  Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran has now been assigned a 50 percent evaluation for migraine headaches, which is the maximum schedular rating available. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 50 percent evaluation, but no higher, for migraine headaches throughout the appeal period have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2007 to May 2011.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions.

In an August 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for migraines, including migraine variants, and assigned 30 percent evaluation effective from December 30, 2021.  In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the August 2022 rating decision.  In December 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2022 rating decision.

Meanwhile, in a February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted a 50 percent evaluation for migraines, including migraine variants, effective from November 16, 2023.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in September 2024 in which he listed the December 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions, which addressed different time periods.  He also elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision and the August 2022 rating decision that was subject to higher-level review.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued those decisions, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Law and Analysis

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with respect to the issues decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial ratings assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

The Veteran's service-connected migraine headaches are currently assigned a 30 percent evaluation effective from December 30, 2021, and a 50 percent evaluation November 16, 2023, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned when there are characteristic prostrating attacks, averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent evaluation is contemplated for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent evaluation is warranted for migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The Rating Schedule does not define "prostrating."  However, "prostration" has been defined as "complete physical or mental exhaustion." Merriam-Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th ed. 2007).  "Prostration" has also been defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1554 (31st ed. 2007).  According to Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 27th Edition (2000), p.1461, "prostration" is defined as "a marked loss of strength, as in exhaustion." See, e.g., Eady v. Shinseki, No. 11-3223, 2013 WL 500460 (Vet. App. Feb. 12, 2013).

Additionally, the terms "productive of severe economic inadaptability" have not been clearly defined by regulations or by case law.  The Court has noted that "productive of" can either have the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing." Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004).  Thus, migraines need not actually "produce" severe economic inadaptability to warrant the 50 percent rating. Id. at 445-46.  Further, "economic inadaptability" does not mean unemployability, as such would undermine the purpose of regulations pertaining to TDIU. Id. at 446; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. The Board notes, however, that the migraines must be, at a minimum, capable of producing "severe" economic inadaptability.

Additionally, the Court has held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  As Diagnostic Code 8100 does not contemplate the effects of medication in alleviating the frequency and duration of the Veteran's headaches, the Board is precluded from considering the relief afforded by the Veteran's medication, if any, in evaluating the severity of his disability. Id.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that a 50 percent evaluation is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected migraine headaches throughout the appeal period.

During a June 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he was not receiving treatment for his headaches, but he indicated that he used Tylenol and Advil.  He identified his symptoms as nausea, visual disturbance "seeing stars," and light sensitivity.  The examiner also noted that his headaches have a duration of less than one day and that he has constant head pain; pulsating or throbbing head pain; pain localized to one side of the head; pain on both sides of the head; pain worsened with physical activity; nausea; vomiting; sensitivity to light and sound; and changes in vision.  She stated that he has characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain more frequently than once per month, but she found that the Veteran does not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  However, the examiner indicated that he would have difficulties with focus and concentration secondary to his symptoms, noting that he has to lay in a dark and quiet room after taking medication for symptoms to subside.  It was further noted that the Veteran reported that he would miss work once per week due to his symptoms.  

As previously noted, the criteria for a 30 percent evaluation contemplates characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average of once a month over the last several months, whereas the June 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran has them more frequently than once per month without any further specification.  Moreover, she did not provide any explanation for her finding that he does not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability, particularly in light of her statement that he would have difficulties with focus and concentration and has to lay in a dark and quiet room.  Nor did she account for the Veteran's report that he would miss work once per week due to his symptoms.  Moreover, the examiner did not discuss the severity and functional impact of the Veteran's migraine headaches without consideration of the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is at least a reasonable doubt that the Veteran more nearly approximated migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks that were capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.  Thus, resolving any reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that a 50 percent evaluation is warranted throughout the appeal period.

A 50 percent evaluation is the maximum schedular evaluation available under Diagnostic Code 8100.  Therefore, an evaluation in excess of 50 percent is not warranted at any time during the appeal period.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 368 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
