ORDER

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

Service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a bilateral hearing loss disability per VA regulations.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had tinnitus at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1977 to October 1981.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted directly as a result of disease or injury incurred in service based on nexus using a three-element test: (1) The existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), (d); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

The requirement for a current disability is satisfied if the disability is present at any point proximate to the claim, during the claim, or to the appeal period.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2014).  If there is no evidence of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Additionally, there must be a demonstration of symptoms proximate to, or since, the time the application is filed.  Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1998).

1. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. For the reasons outline below, the Board finds that service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted as there is not a current disability.  

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

First, the Board finds that the Veteran was likely exposed to hazardous noise during active service due to exposure to cannon artillery fire.  

The Veteran was afforded VA audiology examination in December 2023.  In the VA examination report, the Veteran did not show bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.  The Veteran's hearing thresholds did not measure to be 40 decibels or greater at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000 or 4000 Hertz. Likewise, the Veteran's auditory threshold has never been measured at 26 decibels or greater at any three of the measured frequencies.  The Veteran presented with 100 percent speech recognition scores in each ear.  The VA examiner did note that the Veteran suffered from some level of hearing loss in December 2023 VA examination report, however, the level of loss is not recognized as hearing loss for VA purposes.  

As noted above, the Board finds that the Veteran was exposed to significant noise during service.  However, the most competent and credible evidence of record does not show that the Veteran currently has hearing loss for VA purposes during the pendency of the appeal.  The Veteran showed some hearing loss in the December 2023 VA examination discussed above, however the evidence of record shows that the Veteran does not have hearing loss disability as established in 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  

While the Veteran contends that he has hearing loss, the determination of whether hearing loss meets VA standards to qualify as a hearing loss disability must be supported by testing compliant with VA regulations.  The symptoms the Veteran has reported are not supported by medical professional testing meeting the VA standards for a hearing test.  While the Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms, the determination of whether hearing loss meets the criteria for a disability under VA regulations requires specialized medical knowledge or training.  His statements alone therefore cannot serve as competent evidence of a current disability.  

In summary, for the reasons described above, the Board finds that the most competent evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's reported hearing loss meets the criteria to be considered a disability under VA regulations.  The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997).  In the absence of a current disability, the Board finds that the elements for service connection for a hearing loss have not been met and the doctrine of the benefit of the doubt is not for application.  

2. Service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus.  The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of tinnitus and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Service connection is therefore not warranted.  

The Veteran is competent to give evidence of symptoms observable by a lay person.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain symptoms and the time period that those symptoms appeared).  However, the Veteran is not competent to give evidence as to the etiology of his symptoms because this would require specialized knowledge and experience.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

The Board's review indicates that service and VA treatment records are silent for complaints, diagnosis or treatment of tinnitus during or after service.  The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim.  The examiner noted that the Veteran denied experiencing tinnitus.  See December 2023 VA examination.  Likewise, the record does not contain any statements by the Veteran that he suffers from any symptoms of tinnitus.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record does not support the conclusion that the Veteran has tinnitus.  As with all claims for service-connection, in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Service connection is therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.
