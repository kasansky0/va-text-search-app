REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1990 to October 1994 and in the United States Navy from November 2004 to July 2014.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a February 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.

In July 2022, the Veteran's representative submitted written correspondence in which he explicitly withdrew the Veteran's appeal for earlier effective dates for the increased 40 percent rating for service-connected lumbar degenerative arthritis with IVDS and the increased 40 percent rating for service-connected right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.

Nevertheless, in April 2024, the Veteran was sent correspondence notifying him that a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge was scheduled for July 2024. 

In a July 16, 2024, VA 27-0820 Report of General Information, the Veteran's representative noted the July 2022 correspondence withdrawing his appeals and again indicated that the Veteran wished to withdraw the appeal and cancel the July 2024 hearing. 

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

An effective withdrawal must be in writing, including the name of the veteran (or claimant or appellant if other than the veteran), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5-7 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5.

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the issue on appeal via July 2022 and July 2024 correspondence.  The July 2022 statement contains the Veteran's name, claim number, and specific instruction that the Veteran wished to withdraw all appeals.  Hence, there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 19.55; see Hembree, 33 Vet. App. at 5-7.
