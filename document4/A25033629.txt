A disability rating greater than 10 percent for eczema scarring, right side neck under chin is denied.

A disability rating greater than 30 percent for eczema with bilateral tinea pedis is denied.

A compensable disability rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.

A disability rating greater than 30 percent for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

A disability rating greater than 30 percent for migraine headaches is denied.

Service connection for stroke from burn pit exposure is denied.

Service connection for damaged liver is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's PFB manifests in constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, required over the past 12-month period.

2. The Veteran's eczema scarring, right side neck under chin, does not manifest in visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.

3. The Veteran's eczema with bilateral tinea pedis does not manifest in at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

4. The Veteran has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for erectile dysfunction, and he has already been granted SMC for loss of use of a creative organ. 

5. The Veteran's IBS is his predominant gastrointestinal condition manifested by diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress. The current 30 percent rating is the maximum schedular rating available for IBS.

6. The Veteran's migraine headaches do not manifest in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a stroke from burn pit exposure at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

8. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a damaged liver disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 1991 to January 1996 and from July 1996 to March 2012, including service in Southwest Asia.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in November 2022 (damaged liver) and in July 2023 (remaining issues) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 and July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Whereas here, the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of the assignment of different ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Because the level of disability may have varied over the course of the claim, the rating may be "staged" higher or lower for segments of time during the period under review in accordance with such variations, to the extent the evidence shows distinct time periods where the service-connected disability has exhibited signs or symptoms that would warrant different ratings under the rating criteria.

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

PFB

The Veteran contends that his PFB warrants a rating greater than 30 percent. The Veteran's PFB is rated DC 7806-7800. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. With diseases, preference is given to the number assigned to the disease itself; if the rating is determined based on residual conditions, the number appropriate to the residual condition will be added, preceded by a hyphen. For the following reasons, the Board concludes that a greater 60 percent rating is warranted.

The General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to DCs 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. 

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

The criteria under DC 7800 assign ratings based, in part, on the presence of eight characteristics of disfigurement, including 1) scar 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length; 2) scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part; 3) surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; 4) scar adherent to underlying tissue; 5) skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); 6) skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); 7) underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); and, 8) skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).

Under DC 7800, a 10 percent rating is assigned when there is one characteristic disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.

A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement.

An 80 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022. The examiner found the Veteran's PFB to cause scarring or hyperpigmentation. He did not have systemic manifestations of PFB and had not been treated with oral or topical medication in the prior twelve months. On physical examination, the Veteran was not found to PFB that covers less than 20 percent of his body.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent another VA examination. This examiner found the Veteran to have bumps on his face with discolorations to the face and neck regions. Regarding treatment, the Veteran was noted to be utilizing topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, specifically triamcinolone acetonide. The examiner further noted that the Veteran is utilizing this medication constantly or with a near constant frequency. These findings show the Veteran's condition warrants an increased 60 percent rating as the Veteran needs constant or near-constant systemic of corticosteroids required over the past 12-month period.

The use of these corticosteroids is confirmed in the Veteran's medical records. Specifically, there are several notations of the Veteran's active medications which includes triamcinolone acetonide to be used twice a day. See February 10, 2023, VA Treatment Note. Therefore, based on the above, the Board finds a greater 60 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's PFB.

Eczema Scarring

The Veteran contends that his eczema scaring of the right side of his neck warrants a greater rating. The Veteran's eczema scaring is presently rated at 10 percent under DC 7800. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. For the following reasons, the Board concludes that an increased rating is not warranted.

As discussed previously, the criteria under DC 7800 assign ratings based, in part, on the presence of eight characteristics of disfigurement, including 1) scar 5 or more inches (13 or more cm.) in length; 2) scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part; 3) surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation; 4) scar adherent to underlying tissue; 5) skin hypo- or hyper-pigmented in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); 6) skin texture abnormal (irregular, atrophic, shiny, scaly, etc.) in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); 7) underlying soft tissue missing in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.); and, 8) skin indurated and inflexible in an area exceeding six square inches (39 sq. cm.).

Under DC 7800, a 10 percent rating is assigned when there is one characteristic disfigurement of the head, face, or neck.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with two or three characteristics of disfigurement.

A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with four or five characteristics of disfigurement.

An 80 percent rating is assigned when there is visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of three or more features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips), or; with six or more characteristics of disfigurement.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2020. The examiner found the Veteran to have multiple small hyperpigmented scars in the beard area with an estimated total surface area of 30 x 8 cm. The scars were found to not have any elevation, depression, adhere to underlying tissue, or missing underlying soft tissue. However, the Veteran's scar was noted to have abnormal pigmentation or texture of the head, face or neck. Further, the examiner found the total area of the Veteran's head, face, and neck with hypo- or hyperpigmented areas to be 240 cm2. These findings fail to show that a 30 percent rating is warranted. There are no visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features nor are there two or three characteristics of disfigurement.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in January 2023. The examiner found the Veteran's eczema scar to not have gross distortion or asymmetry of facial features or visible or palpable tissue loss.  The Veteran's scar measured 2.5 cm by 10 cm. The examiner found that there was no elevation, depression, adherence to underlying tissue, or missing underlying soft tissue. The Veteran was found to have abnormal pigmentation or texture of head, face, or neck noting hyperpigmentation. Notably, these findings are all consistent with the Veteran's current 10 percent ratings. There is no showing of visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of one feature or paired set of features. Additionally, there are not two or three characters of disfigurement shown on examination. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not support awarding an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's PFB. At no point has the Veteran been found to have one characteristic of disfigurement. None of the scars associated with his PFB measured 13 or more centimeters in length or at least 0.6 centimeters in width. The Veteran was found at one examination to have hyperpigmentation, but the affected area was not 39 square centimeters. The Board has considered whether a compensable rating could be awarded under another diagnostic code. DC 7804 would allow for a compensable rating if the Veteran's PFB created scars that were painful or unstable, but at no point has the Veteran reported any pain associated with his PFB. The Veteran's PFB has not been found to affect at least 5 percent of the entire body or exposed area, which is necessary to award a compensable rating under DC 7806. As the Veteran has not met the criteria for a compensable rating, a zero percent rating is appropriate for his PFB. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against awarding a rating greater than 10 percent for the Veteran's eczema scaring. In denying such a rating, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. As such, the claim is denied.

Eczema with Bilateral Tinea Pedis

The Veteran is presently rated at 30 percent for eczema with bilateral tinea pedis under DC 7806. The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an increased rating. 

The General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to DCs 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under this formula, a 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period. 

A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. 

A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2023 to determine the severity of the Veteran's tinea pedis. The examiner noted the Veteran to use topical cream to treat his tinea pedis for six weeks or more, but not constantly. The Veteran was also noted to use corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, specifically a topical medication for six weeks or more, but not constant. The examiner also noted the Veteran to have eczema that covers less than 20 percent of total body area. These findings are all consistent with the Veteran's 30 percent rating and do not warrant an increased 60 percent rating. 

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against awarding a rating greater than 30 percent for the Veteran's tinea pedis. In denying such a rating, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. As such, the claim is denied.

Erectile Dysfunction

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for his erectile dysfunction. For the following reasons, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted.

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction has been evaluated as noncompensable under DC 7522. DC 7522 specifically provides that erectile dysfunction warrants a maximum schedular rating of zero percent, with or without penile deformity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522.

The Board notes that a footnote to DC 7522 indicates that the disability is to be reviewed for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of a creative organ under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a). In this case, the Veteran is already in receipt of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ. As such, that matter is not at issue.

In April 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his claim. The examiner stated that the Veteran's penis and testes were not examined at the Veteran's request.

When a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule (erectile dysfunction in this case), it may not be rated by analogy. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333 (2015). Moreover, there is no indication that the Veteran has had the removal of half or more of the penis (DC 7520); removal of the penis glans (DC 7521); atrophy of testis (DC 7523); or removal of testis (DC 7524).

Following review of the evidence, and the applicable law and regulations, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, and thus the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application. As noted above, a noncompensable rating is the maximum rating under DC 7522. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for his erectile dysfunction. The appeal must be denied.

IBS

The Veteran has been assigned a 30 percent rating for his IBS under DC 7319. 

The Board notes that the criteria for rating disabilities of the digestive system were amended, effective May 19, 2024. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities; The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (March 20, 2024). In this case, the rating period on appeal extends from November 29, 2021, (one year before the date of claim) to the date of the rating decision on appeal, July 14, 2023. As this period is prior to the promulgation of the revised rating criteria, the Board will limit its consideration to the criteria in effect prior to May 19, 2024.

Under the version of DC 7319 in effect prior to May 19, 2024, and applicable here, a maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for severe irritable colon syndrome manifested by diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114.

In this case, the Veteran has been assigned a 30 percent rating for his IBS for the period from October 17, 2016, to the present. Because that is the maximum rating that can be assigned pursuant to DC 7319, an increased rating cannot be assigned for the relevant period and the matter must be denied.

Migraines

The Veteran is currently assigned a 30 percent rating for his migraines. The Veteran claims he is entitled to a higher rating. For the following reasons the Board finds the Veteran's current 30 percent rating is proper.

Migraines are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100, for migraines. Under DC 8100, a 30 percent rating is warranted with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. Lastly, a 50 percent rating is warranted with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's migraines have occurred with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022. The examiner found the Veteran experiences headache pain on both sides of his head that worsens with physical activity. The Veteran was also noted to experience non-headache symptoms associated with headaches, including nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, changes in vision, and sensory changes. These symptoms last less than a day and occur on both sides of the Veteran's head. The examiner found the Veteran to have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain that occur once every month but are not productive of severe economic inadaptability. 

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in January 2023. The Veteran reported similar findings since his last evaluation. Specifically, he reported headaches daily, when they are really bad he sees a shimmery light, sometime loss of peripheral vision, that last a couple of hours. The examiner found the Veteran to have pulsating or throbbing head pain of the whole head. Additionally, the Veteran was also noted to have non-headache symptoms associated with his headaches. These symptoms include change in vision that lasts less than a day. The Veteran was also found to have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non0migraine headache pain that occurs once every month. The examiner also noted the Veteran did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. These findings are consistent with the Veteran's current 30 percent rating and don't show very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability that warrants an increased 50 percent rating.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for a Persian Gulf veteran with a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest to any degree at any time. 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1). A qualifying chronic disability is a chronic disability that may result from an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI). 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i).

A Persian Gulf veteran is defined as a veteran who served on active military, naval or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(1). The Southwest Asia theater of operations refers to Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations. Id. § 3.317(e)(2). The period of the Persian Gulf War is from August 2, 1990, through the present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2(i). Additionally, for veterans diagnosed with an infectious disease as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(c)(2), the qualifying period of service also includes active military, naval, air, or space service in Afghanistan on or after September 19, 2001. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(c)(3)(ii).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022. Section 405 of the PACT Act reduces the threshold for establishing eligibility when considering presumptive service connection for Persian Gulf War veterans. Presumptive conditions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a) and (b) may now manifest to any degree at any time. There is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to December 31, 2026. The end date is no longer applicable and will be removed in a forthcoming regulation.

Additionally, the PACT expanded the definition of a Persian Gulf veteran to include those who served in the countries of Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan, along with those who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).

Proof of a current disability is a threshold to establishing service-connection for any claimed disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Stroke and Damaged Liver

The Veteran contends that he has a stroke and a damaged liver that is due to his military service, including from burn pit exposure. For the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection for stroke and a damaged liver is not warranted.

As noted above, the existence of a diagnosed disability is a threshold issue in the award of service connection. VA treatment records have been reviewed and they contain no diagnosis of a stroke or any liver disability.

The Board finds the evidence to be persuasively against awarding service connection for stroke or a liver disability as there is no evidence of record noting any current disability of either condition. Without evidence of a current diagnosed disability service connection cannot be awarded.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record weighs persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a stroke or damages liver disability is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
