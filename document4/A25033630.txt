ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. As new and material evidence was constructively received within one-year of the October 2012 Rating Decision, it did not become final, and, therefore, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode was received on January 10, 2012.

2. The Veteran's January 10, 2012, claim, which did not become final due to the constructive receipt of new and material evidence within one-year of the October 2012 Rating Decision, included the implied claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches.

3. The Veteran's January 10, 2012, claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD did not include an implied claim of TDIU, the Veteran did not file an express or implied claim of TDIU until October 18, 2016, and the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirement for TDIU until October 18, 2016. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for service connection for migraine headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from March 1974 to November 1975.

The matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode is granted.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

The Veteran contends that the October 2012 Rating Decision did not become final as VA had constructive possession of medical records indicating diagnoses of mental health and headache conditions and evidence linking those diagnoses to service. See June 2024 Appellate Brief. Moreover, the Veteran contends that his January 2012 claim of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) included the implied claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines and the evidence at the time was sufficient to warrant an implied claim of TDIU, and, therefore, those claims were also not final in the October 2012 Rating Decision. See id. Thus, the Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grants of service connection and TDIU prior to 2016. See id. 

Lastly, the Veteran contends that his migraine condition manifests in symptoms warranting a disability rating in excess of the current 30 percent. See id. Namely, the Veteran requests a 50 percent rating due to "frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability." Id.

The assignment of an effective date is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Thus, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for service connection or for an increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Moreover, generally, if VA receives a complete application form within one year of receipt of a valid intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

In the legacy system, a claim is deemed final when the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). Claimants have one year to file an NOD to an AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. Moreover, a claim becomes final if a claimant does not perfect an appeal by filing a substantive appeal (VA Form 9) within 60 days after issuance of the SOC or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of mailing of the decision being appealed, whichever ends later. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103. Lastly, Board decisions are considered final on the date the decision is mailed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100. 

However, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), new and material evidence received, directly or constructively, prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. New and material evidence means evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers; which relates, either by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim; which is neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened, and which raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). 

The threshold for determining whether new and material evidence raises a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim is "low." See Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 117-18 (2010). Moreover, in determining whether this threshold is met, VA should not limit its consideration to whether the newly submitted or associated evidence relates specifically to the reason why the claim was last denied, but instead should ask whether the evidence could reasonably substantiate the claim were the claim to be reopened by triggering VA's duty to assist.  

Furthermore, VA is considered to be in constructive receipt of all relevant and reasonably connected VA records, even if those records are not physically part of the Veteran's claim file. Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992). In other words, any records created by VA are constructively part of the record and presumed to be in VA's possession. 

Here, the Veteran first filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD on January 10, 2012, which was denied in an October 2012 rating decision. See October 2012 Rating Decision. On October 18, 2016, the Veteran sought to re-open the claim of PTSD and included new explicit claims of "chronic migra[i]nes" and "unemployability due to PTSD." See October 2016 VA 21-526EZ. The Veteran continuously pursued each of the claims from that date and was subsequently granted entitlement to an effective date for the grants of service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode, migraine headaches, and TDIU as of October 18, 2016. See August 2018 Rating Decision; September 2022 Rating Decision. 

Typically, as noted above, the Veteran's October 2012 rating decision would have become final in October 2013, as the Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or appeal to the Board within one-year of the decision. The Board notes, however, that within one-year of the October 2012 rating decision, the Veteran was treated by the VA for both migraine headaches and his mental health condition, and VA failed to associate the VA treatment records with the case file and, therefore, failed to adjudicate whether the information contained within the treatment records raised a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim. 

Specifically, in an April 2013 VA psychotherapy with medication management appointment, the Veteran was noted as having a history "of flaring easily and throwing things, causing fights in his family," and also noted as having a positive result on the adult questionnaire for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), with a possible indication that he "may have" Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). See April 2013 Psychotherapy Medication Management. The Veteran was further noted as having unspecified bipolar disorder, a mood disorder, and unspecified cluster headache syndrome. See id. As to his "[a]nger management problem ADHD, ODD," and bipolar disorder, the Veteran was continued on divalproic and mood stabilizers and told to "[r]estart bupropion" for his mood and to "[c]ontinue Trazodone . . . for sleep." See id. Moreover, the Veteran was noted as taking divalproex and bupropion for depression and indicated recent cocaine use "to get over stressors in dealing with his job training." See id. The Veteran was further told to "cont[inue] abortive and prophylactic therapy" for his cluster headaches. Id.

Furthermore, in an October 2013 VA mental health appointment, the Veteran "[r]eported [a] long history of discontent and irritability and expresse[d] feeling stuck currently and . . . no sense of any ability to change his situation." October 2013 Mental Health Note. The Veteran denied continued substance abuse, though he noted "that he rarely drinks and only uses cocaine a couple times a year." Id.

Thus, the VA treatment records provided new and material evidence, as they contained multiple diagnoses and directly addressed the Veteran's expressly claimed mental health condition. Accordingly, as new and material evidence was received within a year of the October 2012 rating decision, that decision did not become final. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), new and material evidence received during the appeal period after a decision will serve to preclude that decision from becoming final unless that decision is reconsidered). 

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode was received on January 10, 2012, and continuously pursued from that date. As such, entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for other specified trauma related disorder with bipolar disorder with depressed episode is granted.

Moreover, the Board notes that prior to March 24, 2015, formal claims were not required. Further, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b)(1) (2015), a report of examination or hospitalization may constitute an informal claim. However, "[t]he mere existence of medical records generally cannot be construed as an informal claim; rather, there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for a benefit." Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 504 (2006). Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, were "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see also MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits). 

Here, as detailed above, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for "PTSD" on January 10, 2012. See January 2012 VA 21-526. In characterizing an issue on appeal, the Board further recognizes that when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). In Clemons, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "multiple medical diagnoses or diagnoses that differ from a claimed condition do not necessarily represent wholly separate claims," and that because a lay claimant is only competent to report symptoms and not diagnoses, VA must consider the claim for disabilities reasonably raised by the description of the claimant's symptoms. Id. at 6-7. 

The record indicates that evidence from January 2012 pointed to the Veteran reporting "daily migraines for the last few months, which are reportedly worse when under stress." See January 2012 Mental Health Note. Moreover, the Veteran was diagnosed with cluster headache syndrome and reported taking trazodone and ibuprofen. See id. 

The constructively possessed evidence of record further indicates that the Veteran reported "weekly right frontal headaches, stabbing in nature, usually after awakening," which occurred 3 to 4 times per week, and for which he had "been taking diltiazem . . . for prevention" as well as "divalproex for mood which can also help prevent." August 2012 Primary Care Note.

Pursuant to Clemons, recognizing that the Veteran's formal claim for PTSD was both in writing and clearly seeking entitlement to service connection, and in recognition of the evidence which indicated that the Veteran's diagnosed headache disorder was, in part, aggravated by "stress," as well as the use of the same medication for both his mood disorder and migraine headaches, the Board finds that the Veteran's January 2012 claim included the implied claim for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches. 

This link between the Veteran's mental health condition and his headache disorder is further affirmed by the subsequent grant of service connection for migraine headaches as based on aggravation by his mental health condition. Specifically, in a prior decision, the Board concluded "that the Veteran is entitled to secondary service connection for his migraine headache disability as aggravated by his service-connected psychiatric disability." See September 2022 Board Decision. 

Consequently, entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 10, 2012, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches is granted.

Lastly, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his migraine condition manifests in symptoms warranting a disability rating in excess of the current 30 percent. See June 2024 Appellate Brief. Namely, the Veteran requested a 50 percent rating due to "frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability." Id. However, though the appellant filed a supplemental claim for "effective date/rating migraines" on August 22, 2023, the AOJ did not adjudicate the issue of "rating migraines" included in that August 2023 claim. Compare August 2023 VA Form 20-0995, with January 2024 Rating Decision. Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that issue. The appellant may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU is denied. 

The Board again notes the Veteran's contention that his January 2012 claim of PTSD included the implied claim of TDIU under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), and, therefore, the claim was not final in the October 2012 Rating Decision for the same reasons detailed in the section above. See id. Thus, the Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grants of service connection and TDIU prior to 2016. See id.

As also noted above, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b)(1) (2015), a report of examination or hospitalization may constitute an informal claim. However, "[t]he mere existence of . . . records generally cannot be construed as an informal claim; rather, there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for a benefit." Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 504 (2006). Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see also MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits). 

Under this standard, when analyzing the VA treatment records constructively received, as well as the other medical and lay records associated with the file, the Board concludes that they do not form the basis for an earlier effective date for the Veteran's TDIU claim as part of the Veteran's January 2012 PTSD claim, as that claim cannot be considered an informal or implied claim of TDIU, as they seek discrete entitlements. Moreover, though the Board has construed, as detailed in the section above, that the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD was inclusive of an implied claim for entitlement to service connection for migraines, the Board distinguishes TDIU from a claim of service connection, as, again, they are distinct entitlements. 

The Board further acknowledges the Veteran's contention that in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2009), the Court "held that TDIU is 'part and parcel' with a claim for benefits and must be considered whenever there is evidence of unemployability." See June 2024 Appellate Brief. The Board is indeed cognizant of the ruling of the Court in Rice, and notes that the Court held that a claim for a TDIU due to service-connected disability, either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating. However, in this case, aside from the January 2012 claim detailed above, the Veteran did not pursue any additional claims prior to 2016. See October 2016 VA 21-526EZ. In fact, the earliest express TDIU claim and/or claim for an increased rating was not filed by the Veteran until October 2016, on the effective date for which the Veteran is currently in receipt of the award of TDIU. Thus, as there is no basis under Rice to find that the Veteran's January 2012 claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD is inclusive of an implied claim for entitlement to TDIU, nor are there any other claims between January 2012 and October 2016 for which Rice could provide a basis for finding a TDIU claim was implied, the earliest possible date of claim for the Veteran's TDIU is October 18, 2016.

The Board again notes that unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for service connection or for an increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the one-year period prior to the date of claim for an increased rating, the effective date will be the date the increase was shown. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Accordingly, though the Board concludes that a claim for TDIU was not expressly or impliedly raised until October 18, 2016, the period on appeal also includes a "one-year lookback," starting one year before the claim for a TDIU was submitted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Within that period, the Board notes that the Veteran reported "chronic migraines that he feels prevents work." See March 2016 Family and Medical Leave Act Certification. Furthermore, in an October 2016 VA examination note, the Veteran is noted as having "prostrating migraine headaches requir[ng] that he lay down in a dark room periodically," and that "[t]he proposed treatment now is steroid injections into one of the nerves of the upper [cervical] spine that run into his upper head," which he found "unappealing, stating the projected outcome is sketchy." October 2016 Vocational Rehabilitation Note.

The Veteran further reported that he was terminated from a tech support position in a call center in September 2016 and that his "prostrating migraine headaches required that he lay down in a dark room periodically, and once his" medical leave "ran out his employer would not accommodate this." See October 2016 Mental Health Vocational Rehabilitation Note. However, the Veteran then reported that he "never said that," and challenged the term "prostrating," noting that it should simply say "chronic migraine." Id. The Veteran further challenged a quoted statement that his headaches were, in part, due to "stay[ing] out late too much," while the examiner opined that "the prostrating effects of migraine will continue to impede employment success until arrested by treatment, or finding a job that will accommodate periodic unschedule[d] breaks for laying down in a dark quiet room." Id. 

However, while there is some evidence, albeit conflicting and incomplete, that the Veteran was unemployed or had difficulty maintaining employment within the year prior to filing his express claim for TDIU, the Board notes that an earlier effective date is not warranted as the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirements for TDIU prior to the currently awarded effective date of October 18, 2016. See, e.g., January 2024 Rating Decision Codesheet. Consequently, entitlement to an effective date prior to October 18, 2016, for the grant of a TDIU, is denied.

Nevertheless, the Board notes that this decision grants entitlement to an earlier effective date for two of the Veteran's service-connected conditions but does not assign disability ratings from that earlier effective date. As such, the AOJ will have the opportunity to evaluate whether the Veteran meets the schedular requirement for TDIU from an earlier date upon effectuation, and/or the Veteran will have the opportunity to seek an earlier effective date post-effectuation of this decision.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
