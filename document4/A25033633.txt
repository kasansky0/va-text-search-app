ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 7, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from March 1988 to March 1996. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of history, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea in October 2022. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim in January 2023. The VA received the Veteran's request for Higher Level Review (HLR) in April 2023. The AOJ identified a duty to assist error and, in July 2024, issued the supplemental rating decision on appeal. 

In the August 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or an authorized representative. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issues withdrawn from the appeal. An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

In the present case, on March 7, 2025, VA received written correspondence from the Veteran stating that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. The Veteran stated that he is withdrawing his August 2024, Notice of Disagreement, so that he may file a supplemental claim on the same issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. The written statement includes the Veteran's name, VA file number, and is signed by the Veteran. See VBMS document titled, "VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim," receipt date 03/07/2025. 

The Board notes that on March 23, 2025, the Veteran's authorized representative filed a brief asserting that the Veteran maintains entitlement to a review of the August 2024 Notice of Disagreement as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. See VBMS document titled, "Appellate Brief," receipt date 03/23/2025. 

The Board finds that the March 7, 2025, written statement was submitted and signed by the Veteran, included the name of the Veteran, the VA file number, and a clear and unambiguous statement that the appeal as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is withdrawn. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's withdraw of this appeal was effective when received by the Board on March 7, 2025, and that the subsequent March 23, 2025, brief has no effect on the status of the appeal. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
