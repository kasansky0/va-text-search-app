ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 28, 2018 for aid and attendance of a spouse is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Entitlement for aid and attendance of a spouse arose on the date of the claim, September 28, 2018. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 28, 2018 for aid and attendance of a spouse have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1982 to August 1985.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a higher-level review rating decision issued in September 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

This matter was previously before the Board in March 2021, when it was remanded for further development.

Entitlement to an effective date of October 5, 2018 for aid and attendance of a spouse.

The Veteran contends that his grant of aid and attendance for a spouse should have an effective date from the submission of the claim on October 5, 2018, rather than the currently assigned date of October 2, 2021. 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A claimant may submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed formal claim form within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim. An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) (2018).

Regarding the term "date entitlement arose" this term is not defined in the current statute or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also, McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found." See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested (i.e., the date entitlement arose if it is after the claim was filed). See Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

On January 6, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) issued Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021). The CAVC noted that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2) provides, in relevant part, that VA will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition, including those identified by the rating criteria for that condition in 38 CFR Part 4, VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.

By way of background, the Veteran filed his claim for aid and attendance for a spouse on September 28, 2018 with an accompanying private examination and statement from the spouse. The AOJ denied the claim in October 2018 and the Veteran appealed to the Board, which remanded the claim in March 2021. After the Board remand, an examination was obtained on October 2, 2021, which was then used by the AOJ to grant the claim in November 2021. The AOJ set the effective date to that of the October 2021 examination, stating that the examination was the date upon which entitlement arose. 

In this case, there are only two medical examinations, the private examination submitted along with the claim in September 2018 and the VA examination obtained in October 2021. Thus, the question before the Board is whether entitlement arose with the September 2018 private examination, or whether it arose with the October 2021 VA examination as decided by the AOJ.

The main disability that necessitates aid and attendance of the spouse is Stargardt disease, which caused degradation of vision over time. The October 2021 VA examination found the Veteran's spouse was 20/200 with both eyes corrected. She underwent hospitalization for a right ankle open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) repair and used a cane, has fallen due to dizziness and lack of balance, and cannot see distinctly where she is walking. Her steps blur together, and she may trip over something she does not see. She gets up, fixes breakfast, takes her medication. She has a dog, or someone else, with her if she goes outside since she can't see clearly where if she is walking. She has to help her husband get around due to his walking impairment. She goes shopping and take photos to blowup figures so she can see them. She only leaves the house for medical appointments and shopping. Her husband tries to drive her, but he has his own impairments. She can dress, feed, bathe, toilet independently; however, in order for her to cook someone needs to put all objects in exact locations or she will pick up the wrong ingredient. Someone needs to put her medications in exact locations.

Similarly, the September 2018 private examination found the Veteran's spouse had Stargardt disease, is legally blind with vision at 20/200, would need assistance preparing meals due to her vision, need assistance to identify and take medications, and could leave the house only with assistance. Additionally, the statement submitted by the Veteran's spouse alongside the examination noted on a daily basis, the Veteran has to drive her to day-to-day errands, including the grocery store, pharmacy, and post office. This also includes any appointments. He has to fill out paperwork on her behalf and read mail and assist in any correspondence required. He has to read anything on the television, i.e. closed captioning. He assists her by reading any cooking instructions, food and medicine labels. He helps to make sure that things in the house stay in its usual place including furniture and medications as this is important to her safety and comfort in her own home. If they go out into public settings, such as restaurants or other uncommon places, including the VA hospital, he has to keep close tabs and guide her. If they were to get separated, she would have to wait for him to find me because of her inability to pick him out from any distance. 

After a review of the two examinations, the Board finds entitlement to aid and attendance for a spouse arose with the September 28, 2018 private examination and statement. In this regard, the main disability complications from the spouse's Stargardt disease that are listed in the October 2021 VA examination are mentioned in the September 2018 private examination and statement, such as the impaired vision, the need for the Veteran to help with daily activities, and the need for the Veteran to help anytime they leave the house. There is no discernable difference between the needs of the spouse outlined in the October 2021 VA examination and the September 2018 private examination and statement. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of September 28, 2018, the date of his submission of the claim, for aid and attendance for a spouse.
