ORDER

An effective date prior to October 20, 2019, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not appeal the November 2020 rating decision which awarded service connection for tinnitus.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to October 20, 2019, for the award of service connection for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2005 to June 2009.

The case is on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran filed a motion to revise a January 2020 rating decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) on a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim on November 28, 2022.  The AOJ did not adjudicate the motion to revise the rating decision on the basis CUE.  Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that issue.  The Veteran may resubmit the motion to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

An effective date prior to October 20, 2019, for the award of service connection for tinnitus. 

Legal Criteria

Generally, the effective date of an award is the date after separation from service or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, for claims filed within one year of separation; or the date the claim was received by VA or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, for claims filed more than one year after separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 89 (2009); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended the claims filing process to require the filing of proper standard forms.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the RO mails notice of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1).  If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of these administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  For supplemental claims, VA will readjudicate the claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured and may assign an effective date as early as the date of receipt of the initial claim.  Id.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501. 

Analysis

The Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to October 20, 2019, for the award of service connection for tinnitus.  He asserts that there was a claim pending and unadjudicated prior to this date.  

A review of the record reflects that the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim of service connection for tinnitus in a January 2020 rating decision, which assigned a 10 percent rating effective October 20, 2019.  The Veteran was provided notice of this decision and his appellate rights but did not appeal the decision.  Therefore, the decision is final.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

The Court has held that VA claimants may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date in an attempt to overcome the finality of an unappealed AOJ decision.  See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.  Rather, disagreement with an assigned effective date must be expressed within one year of the AOJ decision making the assignment.  As the January 2020 rating decision assigning the effective dates for this disability became final, an earlier effective date is not warranted.

The only other avenue for an earlier effective date is to request revision of the January 2020 rating decision based on CUE.  The Board again acknowledges the Veteran filed a motion to revise the January 2020 rating decision based on CUE in November 2022.  However, as the AOJ did not adjudicate the motion to revise a January 2020 rating decision on the basis CUE in the first instance, the Board cannot adjudicate any such motion at this time.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 334 (2006) "[E]ach wholly distinct and different CUE theory underlying a request for revision is a separate matter and, when attacking a prior [AOJ] decision, each must be presented to and adjudicated by the [AOJ] in the first instance and, if not, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the merits of the matter."); see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) ("All questions in a matter which under section 511(a) of this title is subject to decision by the Secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary").  As noted above, the Veteran may resubmit the motion to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

In sum, there is no basis upon which an earlier effective date can be awarded based on the instant claim, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300.
