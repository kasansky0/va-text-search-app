REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1980 to November 2003.

This appeal was docketed at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following the submission of a July 10, 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement Board Appeal.  The issues listed on this form were not, however, adjudicated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office or other Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) within one year of the submission, and they have not been validly appealed to the Board.

A review of the record shows that claims for service connection for bilateral trapezius strain, a low back condition, and tension headaches in a January 2004 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and the rating decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. §7105; 38 CFR § § 20.302, 20.1103 (2004). 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim form, requesting service connection for multiple claims, including right and left shoulder/trapezius disorders, lumbar strain, and migraines.  A February 2024 rating decision then adjudicated the issues that had not been previously denied, but the Veteran was sent a separate notification letter that his claims for service connection for migraines/tension headaches, lumbar strain/low back condition, and left and right shoulder disorders/left and right trapezius strain were not filed on the proper form.  This notification letter included information about the types of application forms, including the VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim. 

 The Veteran then submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement in June 2024, attempting to appeal the issues listed above to the Board.  The Board then sent the Veteran a letter later that month stating that the form was not complete, because it did not contain a signature, and that he needed to submit a new VA Form 10182 that contained a signature.  Then Veteran then submitted a form with a signature in July 2024.

Unfortunately, the Veteran appears to have misunderstood what kind of form he needed to submit for the claims listed above.  A VA Form 10182 can appeal decisions to the Board when it is submitted within one year of a rating decision that was issued by the AOJ/Regional Office.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104(a), 20.202.  The notification letter that the Regional Office sent to the Veteran in February 2024 should have stated, in a much clearer manner, that the Veteran needed to submit a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim.  The Veteran then was sent another inappropriate notification letter in June 2024, this time from the Board.  It led the Veteran to believe that his claims were validly appealed if he just submitted a signed VA Form 10182, but this was not the case, as these issues had not yet been adjudicated by the Regional Office.  The Board sincerely apologizes to the Veteran for the confusing nature of these letters and the delay that they have caused in getting these issues adjudicated.

The Board lacks the jurisdiction to decide claims that have not already been adjudicated in a decision issued by the Regional Office/AOJ, followed by a proper appeal of that decision.  The Board has the authority to determine whether it has appropriate jurisdiction over a claim, and because it has no jurisdiction over these issues, they must be dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).  

The Board recommends that the Veteran resubmit his claims on a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim, and the issues will be adjudicated by the Regional Office. 

The Board also points out that the Regional Office did afford the Veteran with a VA examination for the back in November 2023, and the examiner then provided a positive nexus opinion, finding that it was at least as likely as not that his lumbar spine strain was incurred in his active duty service.  This would constitute new and relevant evidence in favor of the claim.
