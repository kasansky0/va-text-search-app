3. Service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy was awarded as secondary to service-connected lumbosacral strain, and assigned an effective date of July 22, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim for the lumbosacral strain.

4. Service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy was awarded as secondary to service-connected lumbosacral strain, and assigned an effective date of July 22, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim for the lumbosacral strain.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1986 to December 1989.  

This matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The July 2023 rating decision was a Higher-Level Review decision that considered the evidence of record at the time of a previous decision by the RO in September 2022.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a), 3.2601.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the portion of the rating decision pertaining to the issues above and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, and the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

As the Board is deciding the claims of entitlement earlier effective date for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

1. Lumbosacral Strain 

2. Left Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

3. Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The Veteran submitted an August 21, 2019, initial claim for service connection for back pain.  A February 2020 rating decision denied the claim of service connection for back pain.  In March 2020, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim seeking review of the February 2020 rating decision.  An April 2020 rating decision continued to deny the claim of service connection for back pain.  

On July 22, 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim application seeking to reopen the claim of service connection for low back disability to include pain.  An August 2022 rating decision granted service connection for lumbosacral strain, left lower extremity radiculopathy, and right lower extremity radiculopathy, and assigned an effective date of July 22, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim.  The RO noted that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was related to the service-connected lumbosacral strain, and thus, assigned an effective date of July 22, 2022, the date of the supplemental claim for the lumbosacral strain.  

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The record shows that the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in March 2020 for the back pain.  An April 2020 rating decision denied service connection for back pain, and the decision became final as the Veteran failed to continuously pursue the claim.  

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system of review, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a new supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1).  Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500 (c)(2).  

Except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision or the Board issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).  

Here, after the April 2020 rating decision was issued denying service connection for back pain, the Veteran did not preserve an effective date by filing an administrative review option, such as a new supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board within one year of the decision.  Thus, the April 2020 rating decision became final.  The Veteran subsequently submitted July 22, 2022, supplemental claim for service connection for low back disability, which was outside the one-year evidence window after the April 2020 rating decision.  Thus, an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.  

The Veteran argues that after the April 2020 rating decision denied service connection for back pain, he timely filed a July 2021 VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim for the disabilities.  See July 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  The Veteran asserted that included in the submissions were lay statements from the Veteran's buddy and wife, where his wife noted back pain which VA should have interpreted as a request for review of the back disability.  Id.  

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  

Here, a review of the record does not show any supplemental claim for the back disability received on or around February 2021.  Rather, a February 2021 supplemental claim was received that listed other conditions (sleep apnea, high blood pressure, vertigo, vision impairment, gout, and a psychiatric disorder), but not for the back disability.  The rating decision listed on the February 2021 supplemental claim form was October 2020, and the back claim was not an issue addressed in that rating decision.  The April 2020 rating decision was not listed on the claim form.  The Veteran's wife's statement is clearly in support of the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea.  She discussed his snoring, tossing and turning, and that his sleep apnea and his back pain prevent him from getting more than three or four hours per night of sleep.  Her statement describes his sleep symptoms such as choking, gasping for air, being tired during the day, and how his sleep related symptoms are impacting their marriage.  Nothing in her statement could reasonably be interpreted as a desire for the Veteran to have his back claim reconsidered.  

The Veteran did not file a claim on a standardized form for his back disability within one year of the April 2020 rating decision that denied service connection for his back disability.  

The Veteran further contends that an earlier effective date for the disabilities on appeal is warranted based on VA's Covid 19 policy titled "Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) Financial Relief Actions and Time Limit Extensions."  See April 2023 Request for Higher-Level Review; see also May 2023 Third Party Correspondence.  He asserted that under the COVID extension, when pleaded, all appeals were considered as timely, and thus he requested that an effective date be assigned as of August 21, 2019.  Id.  

The time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown.  Where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was.  38?C.F.R. §?3.109.  

The Board notes that the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency expired on May 11, 2023.  During the COVID-19 national emergency, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Policy Letter 20-02 provided that effective March?1, 2020, if a claimant or representative requested an extension of a time limit associated with a required action based on the COVID-19 pandemic, VBA would grant the requests for good cause, provided that the time limit would have expired on or after March?1, 2020.  The letter explicitly states that an extension of time would be granted for the filing of a claim that would perfect a previous expired communication of intent to file.  See Policy Letter 20-02 at?2.  

Here, the Veteran generally asserts that he should be assigned an earlier effective date of August 21, 2019, and raises the COVID-19 extension as the basis for all appeals pleaded to be considered timely.  The Board construes the Veteran's April 2023 request as a Motion for Extension of Time to submit a claim within one year of the April 2020 rating decision to preserve continuous pursuit of the claim.  This request for an extension of time is governed by VBA Policy 20-02, as the time limit to file a claim would have expired on April 2021 and as the Veteran asserts that the extension of time was required due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  

The Board is not persuaded by the Veteran's contention with respect to the COVID extension on the effective date of his claim.  While the Veteran generally asserts that he should be entitled to an extension due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the record shows he was able to file claims and documents between April 2020 and April 2021, the relevant one-year time period.  For instance, a review of the record reveals that subsequent to the April 2020 rating decision denying service connection for back pain and prior to the July 2022 claim for which the current effective date of service connection is established, the Veteran filed a February 2021 supplemental claim for service connection for sleep apnea, high blood pressure, vertigo, vision impairment, gout, PTSD, and anxiety.  He also submitted lay and medical statements during the relevant appeal period between April 2020 and April 2021.  Thus, the Board finds that the evidence does not show that the Veteran was prevented from submitting timely filings for his claim of service connection for back disability due to the COVID-19 pandemic as he was able to file other compensation claims.  The record weighs persuasively against finding that there was good cause for failure to submit a timely claim after the April 2020 rating decision.  Thus, continuous pursuit was not preserved, and an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is not supported by the evidence.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than July 22, 2022, for the grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted, and the claims are denied.
