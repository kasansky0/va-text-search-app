FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1969 to June 1973.

On May 31, 2005, the Veteran filed a disability claim for entitlement to service connection for left and right arm with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  On May 10, 2006, the VA Regional Office (RO) issued a rating decision denying service connection for left and right arm.

On September 22, 2008, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for left and right arm with the VA.  On February 24, 2009, the RO issued a rating decision confirming and continuing the denial of service connection for the claimed disabilities.

On September 9, 2020, the Veteran filed a supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for vascular neuropathy secondary to his service connected heart issue.  On November 24, 2020, the RO issued a rating decision finding no new and relevant evidence was received and denied service connection for left and right arm.

On March 3, 2021, the Veteran filed a new supplemental disability claim for entitlement to service connection for vascular neuropathy.  On July 7, 2021, the RO found new and relevant evidence but denied the claim for service connection for left and right arm.

On July 30, 2021, the Veteran appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request.  In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Hearing Docket.  A Board hearing was held on November 1, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of left and right arm, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the readjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the modernized review system, the Board must remand appeals to the RO to correct pre-decision duty-to-assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Here, the record reveals duty-to-assist errors that occurred prior to the July 2021 rating decision; therefore, a remand is required to correct the errors.  Id.  

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection can be established on a presumptive, direct, or secondary basis.   This case concerns the latter of the three theories of relief.  

To establish entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis, there must be (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) a nexus between the service-connected disability and the current disability. Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998), superseded by statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).    

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d. 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  

Secondary Service Connection-Left Arm

The Veteran seeks service connection for his left arm as secondary to his service-connected disability of coronary artery disease (CAD).  The Veteran has referred to this condition as peripheral neuropathy and vascular neuropathy.  See September 2020, VA Form 20-0995 and March 2021, VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran has been service-connected for CAD since August 2003.  See September 2021, Code Sheet.

Service treatment records were reviewed.  The Veteran had no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for his left arm during service.

Private treatment records were reviewed.  On January 7, 2003, the Veteran attended a Vascular appointment and reported weakness in his left arm and light-headedness.  See October 2005, Medical Treatment Record.  On January 23, 2003, the Veteran reported some numbness of his left arm intermittently, and his physician notated "I do not have an answer for that."  See July 2005, Medical Treatment Record.  On October 6, 2008, the Veteran was seen for an electrodiagnostic evaluation.  See September 2021, Medical Treatment Record.  The Veteran reported bilateral hand numbness and aching. Id.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran had a normal electrodiagnostics study.  Id.    

The Veteran's VA treatment records were reviewed.  On April 9, 2003, the Veteran attended a Cardiology consultation where he reported left arm and hand numbness not associated with chest pain.  The examiner provided an impression of left shoulder and arm pain with numbness and weakness.  See March 1, 2017, CAPRI.  On December 17, 2012, the Veteran's VA treatment notes reflect he has subclavian stenosis documented in a doppler study of upper extremity in 2008 with right sided stenosis of more than 60 percent.  See May 2021, CAPRI.   On October 24, 2013, the Veteran saw a VA examiner and reported numbness and profound coldness in his extremities.  The examiner provided an assessment of paresthesias with unclear etiology.  See March 2017, CAPRI.  

On November 13, 2020, the Veteran attended a VA examination for peripheral nerve conditions.  See November 2020, C&P Exam.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis for his left arm.  However, the examiner found decreased strength, in the Veteran's left pinch (thumb to index finger) and grip strength, at a 4/5 (active movement against some resistance). The Veteran reported weakness in grip strength and cold sensation in his hands.  All other testing was normal, and the examiner found no functional impairment.  The examiner provided the following opinion: "There is no diagnosed peripheral neuropathy of right upper or left upper extremity.  The paresthesias/ cold sensations of upper extremities are most likely due to Raynaud's syndrome.  EMG of upper extremities are normal (CPRS 2010), when symptoms began."  Id. 

On February 16, 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination for peripheral nerve conditions.  At that examination the examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis for his left arm.  However, the examiner found the Veteran had moderate paresthesias and numbness in his left upper extremity attributable to a peripheral nerve condition.  The Veteran reported numbness and tingling in hands and all fingers with poor grip in both hands.  All other testing was normal, and the examiner found no functional impairment.  

The Board finds both the November 2020 and February 2021 VA examinations inadequate for adjudicative purposes.  Specifically, the Board finds both examiners failed to reconcile the documented symptoms on examination in contrast to their findings of no diagnosis.  Neither examiner accounted for the pathology of the symptoms identified in their examinations.  

The November 2020 VA examiner did not adequately support the finding of decreased left pinch and grip strength while finding the Veteran had no diagnosis.  While the examiner attributed the Veteran's paresthesias/ cold sensations of his upper extremity to a possible Raynaud's diagnosis, this did not account for the findings of decreased grip strength.  

The February 2021 VA examiner did not adequately support the finding of moderate paresthesias and numbness in his left upper extremity attributable to a peripheral nerve condition, while finding the Veteran had no diagnosis.  

Finally, both VA examiners failed to adequately address the Veteran's subjective symptoms and lay statements.  Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 258-60 (2020) (unless the Board finds the lay statements not competent or not credible, an examiner's opinion must address the Veteran's relevant lay statements in order to include enough detail to inform the Board's decision.  Failure to do so renders that opinion inadequate).  

The Board finds remand is necessary to correct the above pre-decisional duty-to- assist error and fulfill the RO's duty to assist.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Entitlement to Service Connection-Right Arm

The Veteran seeks service connection for his right arm as secondary to his service-connected disability of CAD.  The Veteran has referred to this condition as peripheral neuropathy and vascular neuropathy.  See September 2020, VA Form 20-0995 and March 2021, VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran has been service-connected for CAD since August 2003.  See September 2021, Code Sheet.

Because the legal landscape has shifted appreciably on the question of secondary service connection, the Board believes the following explication will be of some small service to the cause of justice and judicial economy and efficiency-the avoidance of remands.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) had recent occasion to consider matters relevant to the instant case and their holding illuminates the Board's way (and the RO's on remand). 

In Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the Federal Circuit held that under the causation standard of section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code, secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for"  a service connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Id. at 1365.

In the same case, the Federal Circuit expressly held that section 3.310(b) of Title 38 of Code of Federal Regulations, the regulation that would otherwise control the outcome here, is unlawful because it is inconsistent with section 1110 of Title 38 of the United States Code.  Id. at 1366.

After careful review, the Board concludes that the opinion in the record does not address the correct legal standards and the holding in Spicer.  61 F.4th at 1364-66.  

The February 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  At that examination the Veteran was diagnosed with right carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).  The VA examiner opined it was less likely than not the Veteran's right arm was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected CAD.  Specifically, the examiner found the Veteran's "peripheral neuropathy is caused CTS which does not have a causal relationship with CAD."  See February 2021, C&P Exam.  

In reaching their opinion, the examiner used the proximate cause standard from the then-controlling regulation now struck down by the Spicer court.  Accordingly, the Board finds this opinion inadequate because it is premised upon a standard which has departed the firmament; that is to say, it is no longer good law.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  ("Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim . . . VA must provide an adequate one").  

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to obtain a direct and secondary service connection opinion, as outlined below, in accordance with the holding in Spicer.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to consider all the Veteran's VA treatment records, private medical records, manifestation of symptoms, and lay statements for his left arm condition.

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's condition, if diagnosed.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected CAD, was a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's left arm condition?  Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a medical examination and obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's right arm CTS.  The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand decision, must be made available to, and reviewed by, the clinician.  The reviewing clinician must opine on:

Whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the service-connected CAD was a "but-for cause" of (caused an increase in the severity of, or an inability to treat) the Veteran's right arm CTS?  Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-66.

3. A complete rationale, including citation to appropriate medical principles, for each opinion reached must be provided. 

The examiner is respectfully reminded that the absence of in-service evidence of disability is not fatal to a service connection claim. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).
