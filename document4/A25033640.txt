ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 1973 to September 1996.  He served in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.

In January 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  On January 14, 2025, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction identified a duty to assist error.  On January 30, 2025, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In February 2025, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Veteran was notified of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction January 2025 decision on appeal within one year of the issuance of this decision.  However, as the grant of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus represents a full grant of benefits sought, any error is nonprejudicial and constitutes harmless error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection for Tinnitus

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was incurred as the result of his military duties.

Service connection may be granted for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears.  The service personnel records state that the Veteran served in the Navy and his military occupational specialties were "5 inch/54 caliber mount MK (mark) 42 MOD (modification) 9/10 maintenance-man" and navy recruiter canvasser.  The Veteran was placed in a "hearing conservation program."

The report of a July 2023 VA tinnitus examination states that the Veteran reported tinnitus that "onset [in] 1996."  His in-service noise exposure was noted as "[t]he Veteran had a MOS of Machinery Repairman which had a high probability for hazardous noise exposure."  He was diagnosed with recurrent tinnitus.

The evidence is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed recurrent tinnitus originated during active service.  The Veteran served in the Navy as a "5 inch/54 caliber mount MK 42 MOD 9/10 maintenance-man."  He operated and maintained naval artillery.  The Veteran indicated tinnitus was initially manifested during active service.  VA has conceded the Veteran's in service noise exposure.  The Veteran is competent to report that tinnitus was present since service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
