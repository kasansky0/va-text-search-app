ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for low back pain is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

During the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran explicitly requested withdrawal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for low back pain.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for low back pain have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1991 until his honorable discharge in August 2000.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on March 26, 2025.

The Board notes that in August 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for low back pain most recently addressed in an April 2001 rating decision.  In February 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for low back pain is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.

During the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran explicitly requested withdrawal of the appeals for entitlement to service connection for low back pain.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal on this issue, and the appeal is dismissed.
