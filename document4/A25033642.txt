FINDINGS OF FACT

2. In July 2020, the Veteran filed a claim seeking to reopen the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.  

3. New and relevant evidence has been received since the October 2018 rating decision regarding the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.   

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudicating the service connection claim for a left wrist disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d), 3.2501(a), 19.2(a).

2. The criteria for readjudicating the service connection claim for a right wrist disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d), 3.2501(a), 19.2(a).

3. The criteria for readjudicating the service connection claim for a left shoulder disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d), 3.2501(a), 19.2(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2007 to December 2007, December 2008 to August 2010, September 2010 to December 2013, October 2014 to September 2015, October 2015 to September 2016, and October 2018 to September 2021. She has also had additional Reserve service and returned to active duty as of May 2023.

The Veteran's claims of service connection for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities were denied in a September 2020 rating decision that found new and relevant evidence had not been received to reopen the previous October 2018 final rating decision (in pertinent part), which denied the claims. The Veteran initiated the appeal to the Board in October 2020 with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) on the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 rating decision. However, in April 2021, the Veteran filed a second VA Form 10182 requesting a hearing with a VLJ and the opportunity to submit additional evidence within 90 days after the hearing. 

In December 2022, the Veteran testified at a video hearing before a VLJ. A copy of the hearing transcript is of record and has been reviewed. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's hearing docket, the Board may consider the evidence submitted at the time of the September 2020 rating decision, and additional testimony during the December 2022 Board hearing, as well as evidence submitted within 90 days of the hearing. 38U.S.C. §7113(b).

In a March 2024 decision, the Board denied reopening the claims of service connection for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities, finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received to reopen the claims.

The Veteran appealed the March 2024 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in December 2024; whereas the parties filed a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) in which they agreed that the claims should be vacated and remanded back to the Board to apply the proper standard for new and relevant evidence, specifically considering and addressing whether the Veteran's hearing testimony raised a previously unaddressed theory of service connection for a left shoulder disability. 

1. New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the service connection claim for a left wrist disability

2. New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the service connection claim for a right wrist disability

3. New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the service connection claim for a left shoulder disability

38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 provides:

Except as otherwise provided, a claimant or his or her authorized representative...who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim...by submitting in writing or electronically a complete application...on a form prescribed by the Secretary any time after the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending...or has become finally adjudicated....If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the agency of original jurisdiction will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the agency of original jurisdiction will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.

"The new and relevant standard will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under § 3.156(a)."  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a).  "New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators."  8 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  "Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim."  Id.  "Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed."  Id.  

Here, in an October 2018 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.  In the final October 2018 rating decision, service connection for left shoulder and right wrist tendinitis was denied on the bases that the evidence showed no event, disease or injury in service and no nexus to service. Service connection for left wrist tendinitis was denied on the basis of lack of a nexus between a currently diagnosed disability and an injury, disease, or illness in service.  The AOJ notified the Veteran accordingly on October 30, 2018.

In July 2020, the Veteran timely filed a claim seeking to reopen the October 2018 rating decision's denial of the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.  In the September 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate the previously denied service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities (in pertinent part).  

However, the Board finds that the following new and relevant evidence has been received since the October 2018 rating decision regarding the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities: December 2022 Board hearing testimony and VA and private treatment records, and lay statements.  This evidence is new because it was not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  It is also relevant because it tends to prove or disprove matters at issue in the claims.  

Therefore, new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.  The claims are granted to this extent only.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection claim for a left wrist disability

2. Service connection claim for a right wrist disability

3. Service connection claim for a left shoulder disability

As noted above, the Board has found that new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the service connection claims for left shoulder and bilateral wrist disabilities.  However, in the September 2020 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made the opposite findings, and accordingly, did not consider the merits of the claims. 

Generally, when the Board finds readjudication of a claim is warranted, but the AOJ did not, the case must be remanded for AOJ adjudication with consideration of the merits of the claim in the first instance, unless there is a waiver from the appellant, or no prejudice would result from the readjudication of the claim. See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010).

The AMA limits the circumstances when the Board may remand appeals to the AOJ.  However, even under the AMA, the Board still has the duty to remand to correct any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Here, remand for initial adjudication on the merits is necessary because the Veteran has a procedural right to AOJ review of his appeals.
