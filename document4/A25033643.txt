FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction manifest as limitation of abduction of the thigh, motion lost beyond 10 degrees; the left hip impairment did not manifest as favorable ankylosis in flexion at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees and slight adduction or abduction.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's left hip strain manifest as limitation of flexion to 30 degrees, but not less than 30 degrees.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from April 1986 to May 1993.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision and a November 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, with regard to the September 2022 Higher-Level Review on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 18, 2022 rating decisions for the issues of left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy and sleep apnea, the July 19, 2022 rating decision for the issue of DEA and the August 15, 2022 rating decision for the right foot, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

With regard to the November 2022 rating decision on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the obstructive sleep apnea claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

At the outset, the Board acknowledges February 2023 correspondence from the Veteran's representative stating that the Veteran is "requesting the credentials for any and all Compensation and Pension examiner(s) whose opinion(s) the Department of Affairs (VA) relied on to deny the Veteran's claim. The Veteran is raising an objection to the examiner's competence and review of the claim(s)." See February VA 10182, at 2. 

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) issued a panel decision in Francway v. Wilkie, affirming the decision of the Court which found that when a challenge to the competency of a medical examiner is raised, the Board must make a factual finding as to whether the medical examiner is competent. 940 F.3d 1304, 1307-08 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Court held that the challenge must be more than a general assertion that an examination or opinion is inadequate and must be raised by the Veteran in the first instance. Id. A challenge raised under the above circumstances rebuts the presumption of competency and VA must satisfy its burden of persuasion as to the examiner's qualifications by providing the Veteran with information about the qualifications of the examiner. "Once the request is made for information as to the competency of the examiner, the veteran has the right, absent unusual circumstances, to the curriculum vitae and other information about qualifications of a medical examiner." Furthermore, the Federal Circuit has observed that the question of whether an examiner is competent and whether he or she has rendered an adequate examination are two separate inquiries. Francway, 940 F.3d at 1309.

VA examinations and opinions relevant to the present increased rating claims were obtained in August 2022 (received in September 2022). The Board finds that the 2022 VA examiner was competent to assess the Veteran's hip and ankle disabilities. The examination reports identify the VA examiner as an "PA-C," or physician assistant-certified. Physician assistants are healthcare professionals who have completed the necessary education and certification to practice medicine under the supervision of a physician. Thus, physician assistants are competent to provide medical evidence, as they are "qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions." 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).

VA examinations for certain types of disabilities must be performed by specialists. For example, a VA examination for hearing impairment must be performed by a state-licensed audiologist. Id. § 4.125(a)(1). However, there are no specific medical specialty requirements for VA examiners who assess musculoskeletal disabilities. Id. § 4.71a. The examiner's specific area of expertise therefore has no bearing on competency here.

The Board acknowledges that the AOJ did not respond to the Veteran's request to provide credentials for the August 2022 VA examiner. Nevertheless, the Board finds that VA satisfied its duty to assist with respect to all of the claims on appeal. Further, the Board does not find that the February 2023 request was an adequate challenge to the August 2022 VA examiner's credentials as it was no more than a general request rather than an objection to this specific examiner's qualifications. Thus, the Board finds that the presumption of competency has not been rebutted. As such, VA need not satisfy its burden of persuasion by providing the examiner's qualifications and may proceed with adjudication.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (rating schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. The veteran's entire history is reviewed when assigning disability ratings. Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be "staged." See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (staged ratings are appropriate when the factual findings show distinct period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.); see also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (2001).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, consideration is given to functional loss due to limited or excess movement, pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-07 (1995). 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 describe the possible manifestations of functional loss, including decreased or abnormal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance (38 C.F.R. § 4.40), as well as less or more movement that normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and painful motion, swelling, deformity, and atrophy that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing (38 C.F.R. § 4.45). See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

In Mitchell, supra, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that, although pain may cause functional loss, "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system." Rather, pain may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability "to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance." See Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 38, quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more closely approximates the criteria for that higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When, after careful consideration of the evidence, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function, will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. 

In any claim for an increased rating, "staged" ratings may be warranted where the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999) (applying this concept to initial ratings). 

Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1.	Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction prior to August 10, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter, is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction prior to August 10, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5253. The Veteran contends that his symptoms warrant a higher evaluation. See February 2023 VA 10182, at 4; March 2021 MTR, at 2-3.

In January 14, 2020, the Veteran was granted service connection with for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction at 10 percent disabling effective October 15, 2019. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4. The Veteran's service connection for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim and is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.

Under DC 5253, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.

In November 2019, the Veteran was afforded a VA left hip and thigh examination. The VA examiner indicated the complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination were conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "left hip, hamstring recurrent strain." See November 2019 Hip C&P, at 2. The Veteran stated he had constant left hip pain and presented with abnormal range of motion, slight reduction of muscle strength, limitation of abduction to 35 degrees, limitation of flexion to 110 degrees, limitation of external rotation to 45 degrees, as well as painful flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Id., at 3. The Veteran had an antalgic gait with evidence of pain upon weight-bearing and required regular use of a left knee brace. Id., at 5, 7. No muscle atrophy or ankylosis were present. Id., at 6. His symptoms result in functional loss in that the Veteran has difficulty with prolonged walking, standing, bending, or weight bearing, but had no sedentary restrictions. Id., at 8. The Veteran has not had hip surgery. Id.

Based on results from the November 2019 VA examination, the Veteran was assigned a 10 percent disability rating under DC 5253. This rating is based on painful motion of the hip, limitation of abduction of the thigh, motion possible at 10 degrees, limitation of adduction of the thigh (can cross legs), limitation of rotation of the thigh (can toe-out more than 15 degrees, affected leg), painful abduction, painful external rotation, and painful flexion. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4; November 2019 Hip C&P, at 2-3. 

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private medical examination and opinion in support of his claim. The left hip examination was conducted in December 2020. The private clinician, Dr. M.S., indicated that complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination were conducted. The examination of the left hip revealed the following: tenderness to palpation over the anterior/superior iliac spine as well as the trochanteric bursa and ilio tibial band in the left leg. The Veteran's range of motion in the left hip is as follows: flexion is 70 degrees, extension is 10 degrees, abduction is 25 degrees, adduction is 10 degrees, internal rotation is 20 degrees, external rotation is 25 degrees, and the Veteran has pain in all ranges of movements in the left hip. See March 2021 MTR, at 7.

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded another VA hip and thigh examination to assess the severity of his left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction. The VA examiner indicated that complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction." See September 2022 Hip C&P, at 3.  

Range of motion testing indicated 10 degrees on abduction endpoint and 10 degrees on adduction endpoint. The Veteran exhibited pain on flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. The results were the same for both active and passive range of motion. Id., at 7-8. There was evidence of pain upon weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, that results in functional loss in that Veteran has difficulty walking or standing for prolonged periods of time as well as difficulty squatting or navigating up or down stairs. Id., at 8, 18. No muscle atrophy or ankylosis were present. Id., at 14. The Veteran has not had hip surgery or required assistive devices. Id., at 15-16.

In November 2022, the RO assigned an increased evaluation of 20 percent for the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction based on limitation of abduction of the thigh, motion lost beyond 10 degrees as well as additional symptoms of limitation of rotation of the thigh (cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, affected leg), painful abduction, painful adduction, painful extension, painful external rotation, painful flexion, and painful internal rotation. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 3-4; 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction prior to August 10, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter under DC 5253.

As outlined above, under DC 5253, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent is awarded for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. The record, however, lacks any range of motion testing revealing such limitations prior to August 10, 2022. The Board also notes that the Veteran did not report flare-ups and that the November 2019 VA examiner specifically addressed functional limitations with repeated use, concluding that there was no additional limitation at such times due to pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination. See November 2019 Hip C&P, at 4-5. 

There is no other medical evidence during the claims period showing the left hip limitations in rotation, adduction, or abduction required for an increased disability evaluation at any time during the appeal period, including the March 2021 private treatment records. Thus, based on the evidence as a whole, the Board finds the Veteran's left hip disability is appropriately rated at 10 percent prior to August 10, 2022, and at 20 percent thereafter, under DC 5253.

The provisions of 38 CFR § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and are not warranted. The Veteran has been granted the highest schedular evaluation allowed under 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5253.

Additionally, a higher evaluation of 60 percent is not warranted for ankylosis of the hip unless the evidence shows favorable ankylosis in flexion at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees and slight adduction or abduction. Review of the record does not demonstrate that the Veteran experiences these symptoms, nor has he ever, at any point during the appeal period. 38 CFR § 4.71a.

In conclusion, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 10 percent prior to August 10, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter, is not warranted for the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction. Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal is denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

2.	Entitlement to an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion from October 15, 2019 is granted.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks a compensable disability evaluation for his service-connected left hip, hamstring strain, limitation of flexion. The Veteran contends that his symptoms warrant a higher evaluation based on doctor reports of limitation flexion to 30 degrees from October 15, 2019. See February 2023 VA 10182, at 4; June 2022 Third Party Correspondence; March 2021 MTR, at 2-3.

In January 14, 2020, the Veteran was granted service connection for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment flexion at 0 percent disabling effective October 15, 2019. As the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In November 2022, the RO continued the Veteran's noncompensable evaluation for service-connected left hip, hamstring strain, limitation of flexion from October 15, 2019. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 8. 

The RO assigned a 0 percent evaluation for the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion based on flexion of the thigh beyond 45 degrees and symptoms of limitation of adduction of the thigh, painful abduction, painful external rotation, and painful flexion. Id., at 8. 

In order for a higher evaluation of 10 percent to be warranted, the evidence must show that the flexion of the thigh is limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted when flexion is limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted when flexion is limited to 20 degrees. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted when flexion is limited to 10 degrees. 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5252.

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private medical examination and opinion in support of his claim. The left hip examination was conducted in December 2020. The private clinician, Dr. M.S., indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. The examination of the left hip revealed the following: tenderness to palpation over the anterior/superior iliac spine as well as the trochanteric bursa and ilio tibial band in the left leg. The Veteran's range of motion in the left hip is as follows: flexion is 70 degrees, extension is 10 degrees, abduction is 25 degrees, adduction is 10 degrees, internal rotation is 20 degrees, external rotation is 25 degrees, and the Veteran has pain in all ranges of movements in the left hip. See March 2021 MTR, at 7.

Dr. M.S. indicated that the Veteran's left hip flexion has worsened since his last evaluation, is limited to 30 degrees, and he continues to have difficulty resting, sleeping, navigating stairs due to limited flexion of his left hip. Accordingly, Dr. M.S. opined that the Veteran's limitation of flexion at 30 degrees results in a VA disability rating of 20 percent from October 15, 2019. Id., at 9, 14. 

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA hip and thigh examination to assess the severity of his left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction." See September Hip C&P, at 3.  

Range of motion testing indicated 60 degrees on flexion endpoint. The Veteran exhibited pain on flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. The results were the same for both active and passive range of motion. Id., at 7-8. There was evidence of pain upon weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, that results in functional loss in that Veteran has difficulty walking or standing for prolonged periods of time as well as difficulty squatting or navigating up or down stairs. Id., at 8, 18. No ankylosis was present. Id., at 14. The Veteran had not had hip surgery or required assistive devices. Id., at 15-16.

The provisions of 38 CFR § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and are not warranted. 

Additionally, a higher evaluation of 60 percent is not warranted for ankylosis of the hip unless the evidence shows favorable ankylosis in flexion at an angle between 20 and 40 degrees and slight adduction or abduction. Review of the record does not demonstrate that the Veteran experiences these symptoms. 38 CFR § 4.71a.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, such as in the present case, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The benefit of the doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds the evidence is in approximate balance; therefore, an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion from October 15, 2019. To this extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.

3.	An effective date prior to October 15, 2019 for the award of service connection for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction is denied.

4.	An effective date prior to October 15, 2019 for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for service connection of left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction and left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion. See February 2023 VA Form 10182, at 4.

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as specifically provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations clarifies that an award of direct service connection will be effective on the day following separation from active military service or the date on which entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the appellant's claim or the date on which entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

As to what constitutes a claim, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" means a communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). This rulemaking also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

As noted above, the Veteran maintains entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of entitlement to service connection for both left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction and left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion. 

For the reasons outlined below, given the procedural history in this case, the Board finds that an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for both left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction and left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion is not warranted.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for "hamstring tendinitis of the left thigh" on October 15, 2019. See October 2019 VA 21-526EZ, at 4. In a January 14, 2020 AOJ rating decision, service connection was established for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction at 10 percent disabling and for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion at 0 percent disabling. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4-5. VA regulations clearly dictate that the effective date assigned for claims should be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). As the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Veteran then submitted a request for a higher level review on March 19, 2020, requesting a higher evaluation and earlier effective date. However, the higher lever review rating decision dated June 8, 2021, confirmed and continued the evaluation and effective date assigned for both left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction and for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion. See June 2021 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4, 6. A subsequent supplemental claim was received on July 6, 2021 for the evaluations and effective dates assigned. See July 2021 VA Form 20-0995, at 5. Both issues were confirmed and continued in a rating decision dated May 12, 2022. See May 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 9.

A new request for a higher level review was received on May 23, 2022. A higher level review rating decision dated July 5, 2022, found a duty to assist error as VA failed to request new examinations and/or medical opinions. See July 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 2. An examination was conducted on August 11, 2022, and the evaluation for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction was increased to 20 percent effective Augst 11, 2022, in a rating decision dated November 7, 2022. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 3. The evaluation for left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion was confirmed and continued in a rating decision dated November 7, 2022. Id., at 8.

The evidence shows that the correct effective date has been assigned for both the Veteran's left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction and his left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, limitation of flexion. As noted above, VA regulations clearly dictate that the effective date assigned for claims should be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). Because the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In conclusion, October 15, 2019 is the earliest effective date available at law under the facts of this case. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Thus, the Veteran's appeals are denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claims, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeals. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

5.	Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for left hip limitation of extension is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks a compensable disability evaluation for his service-connected left hip limitation of extension under DC 5251. The Veteran contends that his symptoms warrant a higher evaluation. See February 2023 VA 10182, at 4; March 2021 MTR, at 2-3.

In November 2022, the RO assigned a noncompensable evaluation from August 11, 2022. Service connection has been established from the day of the Veteran's VA hip and thigh examination as that is when it was first shown that evaluation for this condition is warranted. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4. 

The RO assigned a 0 percent evaluation for the Veteran's left hip limitation of extension based on extension of the thigh limited beyond 5 degrees as well as additional symptoms of painful abduction, painful adduction, painful extension, painful external rotation, painful flexion, and painful internal rotation. Id., at 4-5. 

In order for a higher evaluation of 10 percent to be warranted, the evidence must show that the extension of the thigh is limited to 5 degrees. 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5251.

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private medical examination and opinion in support of his claim. The left hip examination was conducted in December 2020. The private clinician, Dr. M.S., indicated that complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. The examination of the left hip revealed the following: tenderness to palpation over the anterior/superior iliac spine as well as the trochanteric bursa and ilio tibial band in the left leg. The Veteran's range of motion in the left hip is as follows: flexion is 70 degrees, extension is 10 degrees, abduction is 25 degrees, adduction is 10 degrees, internal rotation is 20 degrees, external rotation is 25 degrees, and the Veteran has pain in all ranges of movements in the left hip. See March 2021 MTR, at 7.

Dr. M.S. opined that because the Veteran's extension is limited to 10 degrees, the Veteran should be rated at 10 percent due to limitation of extension. Id., at 9. The rating criteria under 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5251, however, requires that extension of the thigh is limited to 5 degrees (emphasis added).

In September 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA hip and thigh examination to assess the severity of his left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/adduction. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "left hip, hamstring recurrent strain, impairment of abduction/ adduction." See September 2022 Hip C&P, at 3.  

Range of motion testing indicated 10 degrees on extension endpoint. The Veteran exhibited pain on flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external rotation, and internal rotation. The results were the same for both active and passive range of motion. Id., at 7-8. There was evidence of pain upon weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, that results in functional loss in that Veteran has difficulty walking or standing for prolonged periods of time as well as difficulty squatting or navigating up or down stairs. Id., at 8, 18. No muscle atrophy or ankylosis were present. Id., at 14. The Veteran had not had hip surgery or required assistive devices. Id., at 15-16.

The provisions of 38 CFR § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and are not warranted. 

As outlined above, under DC 5251, an evaluation of 10 percent is warranted when extension of the thigh is limited to 5 degrees. The record, however, lacks any range of motion testing revealing such limitations. Therefore, a higher evaluation of 10 percent is not warranted for limitation of the thigh as the evidence does not show that extension of the thigh is limited to 5 degrees. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that a compensable disability evaluation is not warranted for the Veteran's left hip limitation of extension. Thus, the Veteran's appeal is denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

6.	An effective date prior to August 11, 2022 for the award of service connection for left hip limitation of extension is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for service connection of left hip limitation of extension. See February 2023 VA Form 10182, at 4.

As noted above, the Veteran maintains entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 11, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left hip limitation of extension. 

For the reasons outlined below, given the procedural history in this case, the Board finds that an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection of left hip limitation of extension is not warranted.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for hamstring tendinitis of the left thigh on October 15, 2019. See October 2019 VA 21-526EZ, at 4. In a November 7, 2022 AOJ rating decision, service connection was established for left hip limitation of extension at 0 percent disabling from August 11, 2022. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 2. VA regulations clearly dictate that the effective date assigned for claims should be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). As the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection was established based on the date that it was first shown that entitlement for left hip limitation of extension was warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board has reviewed both the Veteran's VA treatment records and private records submitted by the Veteran but can locate no diagnosis earlier than August 11, 2022 for the Veteran's left hip limitation of extension. 

The evidence shows that the correct effective date has been assigned for the Veteran's left hip limitation of extension. As noted above, VA regulations clearly dictate that the effective date assigned for claims should be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r).

Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

7.	Entitlement an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for left ankle strain with degenerative joint disease is granted.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected left ankle strain with degenerative joint disease (hereafter left ankle strain). The Veteran contends that his symptoms warrant a higher evaluation. See February 2023 VA 10182, at 4; March 2021 MTR, at 1-2.

In November 2022, the RO assigned a 10 evaluation from October 15, 2019. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 5-6. As the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The RO assigned a 10 percent evaluation for the Veteran's left ankle strain based on moderate limitation of motion of the ankle based on dorsiflexion less than 15 degrees and moderate limitation of motion of the ankle based on plantar flexion less than 30 degrees. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 5-6.  

In order for a higher evaluation of 20 percent to be warranted, the evidence must show marked limitation of motion of the ankle based on dorsiflexion less than 5 degrees or plantar flexion less than 10 degrees. 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5271.

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private medical examination and opinion in support of his claim. The left ankle examination was conducted in December 2020. The private clinician, Dr. M.S., indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Examination of the left ankle revealed the following: tenderness to palpation over the lateral malleoli with mild swelling. Veteran's range of motion is as follows: dorsiflexion is 5 degrees, plantar flexion is 15 degrees, eversion is 5 degrees, inversion is 10 degrees. Moderate limited range of motion in the left ankle and foot. Moderate lateral instability in the left ankle and foot. See March 2021 MTR, at 8.

Dr. M.S. indicated that the Veteran has limited motion in dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, eversion, and inversion, which is marked. Accordingly, Dr. M.S. opined that the Veteran's marked limited motion of the left ankle results in results in a VA disability rating of 20 percent from October 15, 2019. Id., at 10. 

In August 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA ankle examination to assess the severity of his left ankle strain. The VA examination reports were received on September 14, 2022. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "bilateral ankle strain" that is worsening in nature. See September Ankle C&P, at 2-3.  

Range of motion testing indicated 20 degrees on plantar flexion endpoint and 10 degrees on dorsiflexion endpoint. The Veteran exhibited pain on plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. The results were the same for both active and passive range of motion. Id., at 7-8. There was evidence of pain upon weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, that results in functional loss in that the Veteran has difficulty walking or standing for prolonged periods of time as well as difficulty squatting or navigating up or down stairs. Id., at 7, 18. No muscle atrophy, ankylosis, and/or joint instability were present. Id., at 13-14. The Veteran had not had ankle surgery or required assistive devices. Id., at 16.

The provisions of 38 CFR § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and are not warranted. 

The Board has also considered a higher evaluation based on ankylosis of the ankle. However, review of the record does not demonstrate that the Veteran experiences these symptoms. 38 CFR § 4.71a.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The benefit of the doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds the evidence is in approximate balance; therefore, an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's left ankle strain from October 15, 2019 based on marked limited motion. To this extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.

8.	Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right ankle strain is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected right ankle strain as secondary to his service-connect left knee condition and mild varus deformity (hereafter right ankle strain). The Veteran contends that his symptoms warrant a higher evaluation. See February 2023 VA 10182, at 4.

In November 2022, the RO assigned a 10 evaluation from October 15, 2019. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 7. The Veteran's grant of service connection for right ankle strain was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim and is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271.

The RO assigned a 10 percent evaluation for the Veteran's right ankle strain based on moderate limitation of motion of the ankle based on plantar flexion less than 30 degrees as well as symptoms of painful motion. Id. 

In order for a higher evaluation of 20 percent to be warranted, the evidence must show marked limitation of motion of the ankle based on dorsiflexion less than 5 degrees or plantarflexion less than 10 degrees. 38 CFR § 4.71a, DC 5271.

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a private medical examination and opinion in support of his claim. The left ankle examination was conducted in December 2020. The private clinician, Dr. M.S., indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Examination of the right ankle revealed the following: no tenderness to palpation over the lateral or medial joint line and no swelling. Veteran's range of motion is as follows: dorsiflexion is 20 degrees, plantar flexion is 40 degrees, eversion is 20 degrees, inversion is 15 degrees. See March 2021 MTR, at 8.

In August 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA ankle examination to assess the severity of his right ankle strain. The VA examination reports were received on September 14, 2022. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with "bilateral ankle strain" that is worsening in nature. See September 2022 Ankle C&P, at 2-3.  

Range of motion testing indicated 45 degrees on plantar flexion endpoint and 20 degrees on dorsiflexion endpoint. The Veteran exhibited pain on plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. The results were the same for both active and passive range of motion. Id., at 7-8. There was evidence of pain upon weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, that does not result in functional loss. Id., at 6. No muscle atrophy, ankylosis, and/or joint instability were present. Id., at 13-14. The Veteran had not had ankle surgery or required assistive devices. Id., at 16.

The provisions of 38 CFR § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in DeLuca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki, have been considered and are not warranted. 

Additionally, a higher evaluation of 20 percent is not warranted for limitation of motion of the ankle as the evidence does not show marked limitation of motion of the right ankle based on dorsiflexion less than 5 degrees or plantar flexion less than 10 degrees. The Board has also considered a higher evaluation based on ankylosis of the ankle. However, review of the record does not demonstrate that the Veteran experiences these symptoms. 38 CFR § 4.71a.

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that an evaluation in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's right ankle strain. Thus, the Veteran's appeal is denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

9.	An effective date prior to October 15, 2019 for the award of service connection for left ankle strain with degenerative joint disease is denied.

10.	 An effective date prior to October 15, 2019 for the award of service connection for right ankle strain is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for service connection of left ankle strain with degenerative joint disease (hereafter left ankle strain) and right ankle strain. See February 2023 VA Form 10182, at 4.

In a November 2022 AOJ rating decision, service connection was established for both left and right ankle strain at 10 percent disabling effective October 15, 2019, the date of receipt of the Veteran's initial claims. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 7. 

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as specifically provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations clarifies that an award of direct service connection will be effective on the day following separation from active military service or the date on which entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the appellant's claim or the date on which entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

As to what constitutes a claim, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" means a communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). This rulemaking also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

As noted above, the Veteran maintains entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grant of entitlement to service connection for both left and right ankle strain.

For the reasons outlined below, given the procedural history in this case, the Board finds that earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for both left and ankle strain is not warranted.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran filed his initial claims for service connection for "left ankle secondary to knee" and "right knee secondary to knee" on October 15, 2019. See October 2019 VA 21-526EZ, at 4. These claims were denied in a January 14, 2020 rating decision. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 2.

The Veteran submitted a request for a higher level review on March 19, 2020, requesting service connection for left and right ankle strain. However, the higher level review rating decision dated June 8, 2021, denied the claims for both left and right ankle strain. See June 2021 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 2, 11. A subsequent supplemental claim was received on July 6, 2021 for service connection for right ankle strain. See July 2021 VA Form 20-0995, at 5. The previous denials of service connection for both left and right ankle strain were confirmed and continued in a rating decision dated May 12, 2022. See May 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 10-11.

A new request for a higher level review was received on May 23, 2022. A higher level review rating decision dated July 5, 2022, found a duty to assist error as VA failed to request new examinations and/or medical opinions. See July 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 2. An examination was conducted on August 11, 2022, and service connection was granted for both left and right ankle strain in a November 2022 rating decision effective October 15, 2019. See November 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 7. 

The evidence shows that the correct effective date was assigned for both the Veteran's left and right ankle strain. As noted above, VA regulations clearly dictate that the effective date assigned for claims should be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). As the Veteran's claim was not received within a year of separation from active service, service connection for left and right ankle strain was established based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In conclusion, October 15, 2019 is the earliest effective date available at law under the facts of this case. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Thus, the Veteran's appeals are denied. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claims, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeals. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

11.	An effective date prior to December 21, 2020 for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (hereafter DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. See February 2023 VA Form 10182.  

Entitlement has been established from December 21, 2020, the date the Veteran met the statutory criteria for a grant of this benefit based on continuous pursuit and his mental health impairments being rated as totally disabling from this date. See September 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 7; December 2020 VA Form 20-0995.

In this regard, for purposes of DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the law relevant to the Veteran's current claim provides that basic eligibility exists where the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a total disability permanent in nature as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

With certain exceptions that are not applicable to the instant claim, the effective date for the grant of such award shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates for awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113(a). 

With respect to this matter, because a total permanent disability has not been established prior to December 21, 2020, the effective date for entitlement to eligibility for educational assistance under Chapter 35 is also not earlier than December 21, 2020. Thus, an earlier effective date is denied as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994). The Veteran's appeal is denied.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Generally, to establish direct service connection, a veteran must show: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). All three elements must be satisfied before direct service connection may be achieved.

Service connection may also be established for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Additionally, certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service if it was noted as chronic in service; or if it manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period (usually one year) following separation from active duty; or if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a)(3). 

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or for additional disability resulting from the aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

12.	Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity (LLE) peripheral neuropathy which he attributes to active service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his LLE peripheral neuropathy is secondary to his service-connected left knee condition. See February 2023 VA Form 10182; May 2021 VA 21-526.

Because the Veteran has not raised, and the record does not reasonably raise, entitlement to direct service connection, the Board's adjudication will consider only entitlement to secondary service connection. 

As an initial matter, the current disability element of the Veteran's claim is not in dispute. A September 2021 VA examination confirms the Veteran was diagnosed with LLE peripheral neuropathy. See September 2021 Nerve C&P, at 2. Moreover, the Board notes that the RO found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of LLE peripheral neuropathy. See September 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 8. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Board finds the current disability element of a service connection claim for LLE peripheral neuropathy is met. See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167. 

The second element of service connection requires an in-service incurrence. The Veteran contends that his LLE peripheral neuropathy is secondary to his service-connected left knee condition. In its September 2022 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran's claimed primary condition is service-connected in that service connection has been established for left knee degenerative joint disease, varus deformity, status post PCL reconstruction and meniscectomy. See September 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 8. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Board finds the second element of service connection, an in-service incurrence, is also met. See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

Turning to the final element of secondary service connection, the Board must determine whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's service-connected disability and the current disorder. 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the record contains contradicting opinions discussing multiple theories of entitlement which must be considered and weighed. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993) (citing Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 192-93 (1992)); see also Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-471 (1993) (stating that the probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion the physician reaches; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board). When faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998), citing Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995). The Board will consider each of the opinions below.

First, the Board turns to the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) which are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy or related conditions. 

January 2013 post service outpatient treatment records show the Veteran presented for a renal consultation and was found to have diabetic neuropathy as well as recurrent diabetic foot ulcers. See June 2022 CAPRI, at 57, 61. 

In January 2020, the Veteran's private podiatrist treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with diabetes with neuropathy and onychomycosis, status post foot surgery for infections. See June 23, 2022 CAPRI, at 377, 381. December 2020 VA outpatient treatment records indicate that the Veteran is diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy. See June 21, 2022 CAPRI, at 57, 70, 76. January 2021 VA outpatient treatment records indicate that the Veteran was prescribed micro z socks and extra depth shoes to treat his diabetic neuropathy and foot deformity. See June 23, 2022 CAPRI, at 330. A May 2021 orthopedic surgery consult note indicates that the Veteran has diabetic neuropathy with prior left foot ulcer. Id. at 277.

In September 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the onset and origin of the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with LLE peripheral neuropathy. See September 2021 Nerve C&P, at 2. The VA examiner positively opined that the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is at least as likely as not due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected left knee condition. See September 2021 Nerve Opinion, at 2-3. As rationale, the VA examiner explained that the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is at least as likely as not due to the Veteran's left knee status post posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and meniscectomy (limitation of flexion), left knee degenerative joint disease, mild varus deformity status post posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, meniscectomy (limitation of flexion), left knee degenerative joint disease, mild varus deformity status post posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, as well as meniscectomy (instability) as it is possible for a nerve to be cut during surgery, and this may be unavoidable during the procedure. Id., at 3.

In May 2022, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination to reconcile conflicting medical evidence regarding the onset and origin of the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy. Specifically, the VA examiner was asked to address whether the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is related to his non-service connected diabetes or his service-connected left knee conditions. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected left knee condition. See May 2022 Nerve Opinion, at 4. As rationale, the VA examiner explained that the Veteran had left knee ACL repair in the military in 1992. There is no mention of LLE peripheral neuropathy prior to 2009, at which time the Veteran had a left foot surgery for a foot ulcer caused by diabetes mellitus, type 2. The Veteran had two surgeries in 2009 and records report a healed ulcer in 2013. The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's civilian podiatrist noted diabetes with neuropathy and onychomycosis, status post foot surgery for infections. Citing medical literature, the VA examiner further stated that the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is less likely than not due to his left knee ACL repair surgery , but rather due to his non-service connected condition of diabetes mellitus. Id.

The Board affords significant probative weight to the September 2021 and May 2022 VA opinions. The opinions were provided by qualified medical professionals after review of the Veteran's claims file, consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, including citation of medical literature, and application of the facts to current medical knowledge. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning). 

The Board "may favor one medical opinion over another" if it offers an adequate statement of reasons or bases. See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2008). There is no single method for assigning weight or weighing opinions against each other. However, when determining how much weight to assign an opinion or deciding whether to favor one opinion over another, the focus is generally on three factors: the opining physician's expertise or training; the facts and data the opinion is based on; and the quality of the rationale supporting the opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008). 

In weighing these opinions, the Board assigns the September 2021 opinion less probative weight because the opinion appears to be based on speculation. In particular, the assertion that it is possible for a nerve to be cut during surgery, and this may be unavoidable during the left knee procedure. Further, the Veteran's treatment records identify the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy as diabetic neuropathy, which aligns with the May 2022 VA examiner's opinion. Therefore, the Board finds the May 2022 VA examiner's opinion to be more probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 295.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's LLE peripheral neuropathy is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include as secondary to his service-connect left knee condition. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application as to this claim. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021), affirmed en banc Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). The Veteran's appeal is denied.

13.	Entitlement to service connection for right foot mild degenerative changes is denied.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for right foot mild degenerative changes (hereafter right foot condition) which he attributes to active service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his right foot condition is secondary to his service-connected left knee condition. See February 2023 VA Form 10182; September 2019 VA 21-256EZ.

Because the Veteran has not raised, and the record does not reasonably raise, entitlement to direct service connection, the Board's adjudication will consider only entitlement to secondary service connection. 

As an initial matter, the current disability element of the Veteran's claim is not in dispute. The Veteran was diagnosed with right foot mild degenerative changes in the metatarsophalangeal joints of the big toe with hallux valgus and plantar calcaneal spurs during an August 2022 VA examination. See August 2022 Foot C&P, at 3. Moreover, the RO found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability. See August 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 4. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Board finds the current disability element of a service connection claim for a right foot condition is met. See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167. 

The second element of service connection requires an in-service incurrence. The Veteran contends that his right foot condition is secondary to his service-connected left knee condition. In its September 2022 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran's claimed primary condition is service-connected as service connection has been established for left knee degenerative joint disease, varus deformity, status post PCL reconstruction and meniscectomy. See September 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 8. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the Board finds the second element of service connection, an in-service incurrence, is also met. See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

Turning to the final element of secondary service connection, the Board must determine whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's service-connected disability and the current disorder. 

First, the Board turns to the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) which are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of any right foot conditions. 

By way of procedural background, the Veteran was previously denied entitlement to service connection in a January 14, 2020 rating decision that found no clinical diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disability involving the Veteran's right foot was of record. See January 2020 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 10. This decision was confirmed and continued in a rating decision dated June 8, 2021 as the evidence continued to show diabetic involvement with the Veteran's right foot, but no evidence that his right foot disability was due to his service-connected left knee disabilities. See June 2021 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 8. Upon review of the Veteran's recent VA medical center records, an examination and medical opinion were requested. See May 2022 VA 21-2507a. 

In August 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA foot examination to access the onset and origin of his right foot disability. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file and in-person examination had been conducted. Here, the VA examiner diagnosed right foot mild degenerative changes in the metatarsophalangeal joints of the big toe with hallux valgus and plantar calcaneal spurs. See August 2022 Foot C&P, at 3. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right foot condition was less likely than not due to his service-connected left knee degenerative joint disease and mild varus deformity status post posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and meniscectomy (both flexion and instability). See August 2022 Foot Opinion, at 2. As rationale, the examiner explained that the "Veteran does not have a "compensatory" gait. Contrary to enthusiastic popular media reports, forceful opinions expressed on Internet discussion boards, and Veterans Service Officers' heartfelt recommendations, the use of the word "compensatory or compensation" is overly stated and grossly misunderstood by the lay person. He has no major muscle damage, no major nerve damage, no significant leg length discrepancy > 4cm and no significant Trendelenburg lurch gait or steppage gait that would support one lower extremity joint affecting another lower extremity joint." Id., at 4. The VA examiner also discusses a March 3, 2022 note, which he refers to as a subjective note as documented by the Veteran history's and not the same as a peer review article review. The note references a supposed leg length discrepancy that was noted by a store associate who told the Veteran that based off the way he walked; the associate could tell he had a leg length problem (as per the Veteran's history). The VA examiner states that the Veteran's records show a left foot condition secondary to a non-service connected diabetes condition. The VA examiner opines that neither the right foot documentation nor the left foot documentation has any relationship to the service-connected left knee. Id., at 5.

The Board affords significant probative weight to the August 2022 VA opinion. The opinion was provided by a qualified medical professional after review of the Veteran's claims file, consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, including citation of medical literature, and application of the facts to current medical knowledge. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's right foot condition is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include as secondary to his service-connect left knee condition. Thus, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application as to this claim. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021), affirmed en banc Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). The Veteran's appeal is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1.	Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

On appeal, the Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (hereafter OSA) which he attributes to active service. Specifically, the Veteran contends his OSA is related to his service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder with associated depressed mood (hereafter anxiety disorder). See February 2023 VA Form 10182; July 2021 VA Form 20-0995; March 2022 VA 21-526EZ.

The current disability element of the Veteran's claim is not in dispute. A March 2022 sleep study confirms a diagnosis of OSA. See July 2022 C&P Exam, at 2-3. Moreover, the Board notes that the RO found that the Veteran has a current OSA disability. See September 2022 Rating Decision - Narrative, at 11. The Board is bound by this prior favorable finding, which was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

However, the Board cannot yet adjudicate the Veteran's claim because the record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to make a determination on the claim. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (explaining that the Board shall remand to the AOJ for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); see Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (explaining that any opinion obtained pursuant to VA's duty to assist must be adequate). 

Remand is required for an addendum medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's OSA is caused or aggravated by his obesity as an intermediate step.

In March 2022, the Veteran underwent a sleep study where he was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. See July 2022 Sleep Study C&P, at 1. The Veteran had a BMI of 31.2 at the time of this study. Id. 

In July 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to access the onset and origin of his claimed OSA. The VA examiner indicated that a complete review of the Veteran's claims file was conducted. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with OSA with persistent daytime hypersomnolence as confirmed by a sleep study. See July 2022 Sleep C&P, at 2-3. The VA examiner was asked whether any currently diagnosed condition related to the Veteran's OSA, is due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder with associated depressed mood. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected condition. As rationale, the VA examiner explained that the time of the March 2022 sleep study, the Veteran had a BMI above 25 in either the overweight or obese category, which is a majority cause of sleep apnea. The VA examiner stated that "unfortunately therefore any other causes less likely than not the cause of OSA, including unspecified anxiety disorder with associated depressed mood." See July 2022 Sleep Opinion, at 2.

When the Secretary undertakes to provide a Veteran with a VA examination or medical opinion, it must be adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). The Board may reject a medical opinion that is conclusory and lacks supporting analysis. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007). 

As noted above, the July 2022 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's OSA was caused by his obesity. In addition, the Veteran's March 2022 sleep study confirms a BMI of 31.2. As the evidence shows that the Veteran has a higher BMI, the theory that the Veteran's OSA could have been caused by his service-connected disabilities, such as his mental health and/or musculoskeletal disabilities, by way of obesity as the intermediate step was reasonably raised by the record. Remand is required for an addendum medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's OSA is caused or aggravated by his obesity as an intermediate step.

Regrettably, the Board is unable to make a determination on this theory at this time because no VA examiner has ever considered the theory of secondary service connection with obesity as an intermediate step. See VAOPGPREC 1-2017 (January 6, 2017); see also Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020). Therefore, the Board finds that another VA addendum opinion addressing the obesity-as-intermediate-step theory is required.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a VA medical opinion from a qualified examiner regarding the etiology of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea. The examiner must review the entire claims file, to include a copy of this remand, and consider the Veteran's lay statements. All necessary testing must be performed. The examiner is then asked to render an opinion, including rationale, addressing the following:

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, or higher) that any of the Veteran's service-connected conditions, in particular unspecified anxiety disorder and/or his musculoskeletal disabilities, caused the Veteran to become obese?

(b)	IF AND ONLY IF the answer to the question above is yes (i.e., the examiner opines that the Veteran's service-connected condition(s) caused OR aggravated his weight gain/obesity), then the examiner also must answer the following questions:

(i)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's obesity was a substantial factor in causing his current obstructive sleep apnea? 

(ii)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current obstructive sleep apnea would not have occurred, but for his weight gain/obesity? 

If medical literature is relied upon, the examiner should identify and specifically cite each reference material used. The examiner should discuss any contradictory evidence in the claims file and reconcile that evidence with their findings.

All opinions should be accompanied by supporting rationale explaining how the examiner arrived at the conclusions expressed, citing to specific evidence of record, as necessary. 

If the examiner determines that s/he cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, s/he should explain the inability to provide an opinion, identifying what facts could not be determined. In particular, s/he should comment on whether an opinion could not be provided because the limits of medical knowledge have been exhausted or whether additional testing or information could be obtained that would lead to a conclusive opinion.
