REMANDED

Entitlement to benefits under the Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) program, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. ยง 1717, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1981 to April 1984.

This appeal is before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a May 2020 determination by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). In the June 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the evidence submission docket, which allows review of the evidence of record at the time of the VHA decision on appeal and evidence submitted within 90 days of the election of the evidence submission lane.

The Veteran is appealing a May 2020 VHA decision, which denied benefits under the HISA program. The record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning this claim. The claims file does not contain a copy of the initial claims application or the May 2020 decision on appeal. VHA medical records or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim is also missing from the claims file.

As these pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim.

Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to associate with the electronic claim file all documentation relevant to the matter on appeal.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Associate with the electronic claim file all documentation relevant to the matter on appeal of entitlement to benefits under the HISA program, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. ยง 1717, previously adjudicated in the May 2020 decision. Any unsuccessful attempts to obtain such records must be clearly documented. If such records are unavailable, make a formal finding of unavailability.
