ORDER

New and relevant evidence has been presented to warrant readjudication of the claim of entitlement for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veteran's death claimed as due to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical treatment.

REMANDED

New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veteran's death claimed as due to VA medical treatment is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

Following the lapse of the appeal period of an August 2021 rating decision, new evidence was received, which is relevant because it tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudication of the claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veteran's death claimed as due to VA medical treatment are met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to August 1972. Sadly, the Veteran died in March 2021. The appellant is his surviving spouse. 

This matter initially comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appellant filed a timely Notice of Disagreement in July 2023 and selected the Evidence Submission docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

In an October 2023 decision, the Board denied the claim, finding new and relevant evidence had not been received. The appellant appealed the October 2023 Board decision, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims (CAVC or Court). In a September 2024 Order, the CAVC granted a Joint Motion for Remand ("JMR") vacating and remanding the issues of: (1) whether new and relevant evidence has been received; and (2) if so, whether there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The parties agreed that the Board failed to provide adequate reasons or bases for why there was not new and relevant evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). Further, the parties determined that it "appear[ed]" that the January 2023 VA medical opinions did not adequately address whether VA had deviated from the standard of care when it did not (1) include the "black box warning" on [the Veteran's] prescription, and (2) refill his medication in a timely fashion." As such, the parties instructed the Board to consider whether there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) if a determination was made that new and relevant evidence had been received.  

Upon return from the Court, in September 2024, the Board sent the appellant and her representative at the time a notice letter informing them that the case had been received by the Board from the Court. The appellant was advised she had 90 days to submit additional argument. The appellant retained a new representative shortly thereafter. In December 2024, the Board sent the appellant and her new representative a notice letter informing them that the case had been received by the Board from the Court. The appellant was afforded another 90 days to submit additional argument. 

In December 2024 and February 2025, the appellant submitted additional argument (duplicates of previously submitted evidence and summaries of such) and evidence (a June 2024 private medical opinion from A.G., R.N.). Based on the appellant's selection of the Evidence Review docket under the AMA, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days from submission of the VA Form 10182 on July 10, 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. Thus, the Board is precluded from consideration of any new evidence (e.g., the June 2024 private medical opinion from A.G., R.N) submitted outside of this evidentiary window. However, as the Board is remanding the claim herein, this additional evidence will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.

This appeal has now returned to the Board, with consideration of the additional argument submitted by the appellant. Prior to adjudication, the Board must first address the directives in the September 2024 JMR.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c); 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).

Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veteran's death claimed as due to VA medical treatment.

Under the AMA, when a claim has been previously disallowed, it may not be readjudicated upon the same factual basis, unless the Veteran submits a supplemental claim along with new and relevant evidence. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501. If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. §§3.156(d), 3.2501.

New evidence is evidence that was not previously part of the record before agency adjudicators at the time of the prior denial. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a). Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim, including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement to benefits that was not previously addressed. Id. 

Service connection for the Veteran's cause of death was initially denied in a rating decision issued August 2021. While 38 U.S.C. § 1151 was not cited to in this rating decision, the AOJ addressed the legal standards applicable to 38 U.S.C. § 1151 in denying the claim. The appellant did not submit any of the available administrative review options within one year of notice of the August 2021 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Because there was no continuous pursuit under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, in order to readjudicate the claim, new and relevant evidence must be presented or secured. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking readjudication of the claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151. Included with the supplemental claim submission were the Veteran's phone records (showing calls to/from Veteran and VA, including the VA pharmacy), transcribed voicemails from VA medical facilities including VA pharmacy, an article from WebMD discussing side effects of Duloxetine to include suicidal thoughts, a Case report from Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health entitled "Duloxetine and suicide attempts: a possible relation," a December 2021 MedWatch Consumer Voluntary Reporting (Form FDA 3500B) completed by the appellant in relation to the Veteran's suicide and Duloxetine, the full prescribing guidelines for Cymbalta (Duloxetine), and lay statements from the appellant. New VA medical opinions were associated with the claims file in January 2023.  

In the May 2023 rating decision that followed, the AOJ continued denial of service connection for cause of death and denied the claim for death benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 as a separate issue, finding new evidence submitted and/or associated with the claims file was not relevant because it did not prove or disprove a matter at issue with the claim. 

As per the directive in the September 2024 JMR, the first question before the Board is whether new and relevant evidence has been received in accordance with the standards set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). The October 2023 Board decision found there was no new evidence of record relevant to establishing that an additional disability was caused by carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgement, or similar fault on the part of VA in furnishing medical care related to the Duloxetine prescription or was caused by an event not reasonably foreseeable, citing to reiterations of arguments adjudicated in the original claim. The Board now carefully reconsiders this matter in line with the interested parties JMR. In doing so, the Board notes that the "new and relevant" standard under the AMA will not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under § 3.156(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a). Further, while not binding on the Board, the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual specifies there is no requirement that relevant evidence prove a previously unsubstantiated matter. See M21-1, X.ii, 2.A.2.d. 

The January 2023 VA medical opinions determined VA treatment did not contribute to or cause the Veteran's death. While these findings are similar to prior VA examination findings, such findings nonetheless tend to disprove a matter at issue with the claim. The Veteran's phone records, and transcribed voicemails, arguably provide a more complete picture regarding the nature of VA medical treatment. While the appellant had summarized such evidence in prior lay statements, to the extent these records substantiate the appellant's assertions, they tend to prove a matter at issue with the claim. Thus, having now reconsidered the low threshold standard for new and relevant evidence in line with the September 2024 JMR, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veterans death claimed as due to VA medical treatment.

REASONS FOR REMAND

New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the claim for compensation under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for the cause of the Veterans death claimed as due to VA medical treatment is remanded.

Under the AMA, remand is required if the Board finds that a duty to assist error occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The duty to assist includes ensuring that a VA medical examination, once provided, is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). VA's duty to provide an adequate medical examination and opinion applies to § 1151 claims. See Trafter v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 267, 273-75 (2013).

As per the September 2024 JMR directive, having now determined new and relevant evidence has been received, the Board must address the adequacy of the January 2023 VA medical opinions. In the JMR, the interested parties indicated that it did not appear the January 2023 VA medical opinion addressed whether VA deviated from standard of care in not including the "black box warning" on the Veteran's February 2, 2021, prescription. This warning, which was included on a medication refill delivered after the Veteran's death as per photographs submitted by the appellant, is as follows: "Call your doctor immediately if you have mental/mood changes like confusion, new/worsening feelings of sadness/fear, thoughts of suicide, or unusual behavior." A photograph of the February 2021 warning label was also submitted by the appellant, which did not include a warning regarding mental/mood changes to include thoughts of suicide.  The JMR highlighted appellant had argued VA failed to meet standard of care when it failed to warn the Veteran of the higher risk of suicide prior to the March 23, 2021, prescription. 

The Board observes that the refill of Duloxetine on February 2, 2021, was noted in the January 2023 VA medical opinion; however, there was no mention by the VA examiner of the warning label differing from that provided after the Veteran's death in March 2021. Thus, the Board finds that the issue of whether VA deviated from standard of care when it did not include the "black box warning" on his February 2, 2021, prescription was not adequately addressed in the January 2023 VA medical opinions. 

The JMR further specified that it did not appear the January 2023 VA examination adequately addressed whether VA deviated from the standard of care when it did not refill his medication in a timely fashion. The JMR highlighted appellant had argued VA was negligent in not refilling his "highly addictive" prescription, which caused him to go "cold turkey" for three weeks. While the VA medical opinion concluded VA pharmacy did not deviate from standard of care, the gap between the Veteran's medication running out and the refill being provided was not discussed. The VA medical opinion simply noted the "last refill was Feb 02, 2021, issued 30 days and on 22 MAR 2021 @8:45 call for refill request for Duloxetine and was delivered." Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the issue of whether VA deviated from standard of care in not refilling the Veteran's medication in a timely fashion was not adequately addressed in the January 2023 VA medical opinions. 

For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds the January 2023 VA medical opinions are inadequate and constitute a pre-decisional duty to assist error that require a new medical opinion. Accordingly, a remand is warranted. In remanding this claim, the Board intimates no opinion as to the credibility or probative value of any lay statements of record.

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate clinician for an addendum medical opinion related to the Veteran's 38 C.F.R. § 1151 claim. A complete copy of the claims file, to include a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner. After thorough review of the medical and lay evidence of record, the examiner should respond to the following:

Is in approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's death a result of carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance or fault on the part of VA?

In responding to this question, address whether there was a delay in providing the prescribed Duloxetine medication that deviated from a standard of care ordinarily required of medical professionals? If so, address whether the Veteran's death probably would have been avoided if not for such delay. Also address whether VA deviated from standard of care in not including the "black box warning" on the Veteran's February 2, 2021, Duloxetine prescription.

2.  Readjudicate the issue on appeal.
