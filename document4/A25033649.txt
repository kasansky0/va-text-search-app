ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 26, 2023, for the award of a 20 percent rating for residuals of bladder cancer, is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of bladder cancer is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, for an increased rating for the service-connected residuals of bladder cancer was received by VA on June 26, 2023.

2. The evidence does not reflect that the severity of the Veteran's residuals of bladder cancer condition increased at a specific point during the one-year period prior to June 26, 2023.

3. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected malignant neoplasm of the bladder manifested as urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval of one to two hours and awakening to void three to four times per night, but did not require the wearing of absorbent materials, or result in obstructive voiding or renal dysfunction. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 26, 2023, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for residuals of bladder cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400. 

2. The criteria for a rating higher than 20 percent for residuals of bladder cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from July 1966 to August 1970.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

A claim for a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability, either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). In this case, the Veteran has not argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that the disability at issue renders him unemployable. Accordingly, no further consideration of entitlement to TDIU under Rice is required.

Finally, in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). However, the Veteran responded to the Board's January 2025 letter regarding his right to switch dockets, and later in January 2025, the Veteran affirmatively waived his right to select a different Board review option. Accordingly, the Board finds that it may proceed with adjudication.

Earlier Effective Date

In general, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The effective date for an increased rating is to be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for increased rating is the date of receipt of the claim for increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Determining an appropriate effective date for an increased rating involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997).

Beginning March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a). 

An effective date earlier than June 26, 2023, for a 20 percent rating for residuals of bladder cancer.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the award of a 20 percent rating for his residuals of bladder cancer. Specifically, the Veteran requested "retro active pay due to Pact Act now being in effect." See August 2023 VA Form 21-4138.

By way of procedural history, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ in August 2022, contending service connection for bladder cancer based on exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Guam. An April 2023 rating decision assigned the Veteran a noncompensable (0 percent) rating for residuals of bladder cancer of the bladder, effective August 11, 2022, the date of his initial claim. Review of the record shows that the Veteran file an appeal with respect to that decision, or submit new and relevant evidence within 1 year of that rating decision. Thus, it became final. 

On June 26, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim, seeking an increased rating for his residuals of bladder cancer disability.  In July 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision which increased the disability rating to 20 percent effective date of June 26, 2023, the day VA received the Veteran's claim for an increase. Thus, in order to award an earlier effective date for the assigment of a 20 percent rating for bladder cancer residuals, entitlement must have arisen at a psecific point within the 1 yaer period prior ot the date of claim.

Here, neither the Veteran's August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ nor the Veteran's June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ identified any VA treatment records relevant to his claim. Further, he did not submit any private treatment records relating to the claim for increase, or authorize VA to obtain private records by submitting a VA Form 21-4142. 

Thus, the sole evidence of record dated between the August 2022 effective date service connection was granted and the June 26, 2023, date that the increase was granted is the January 2023 VA examination, at which time the Veteran reported urinary retetntion immediately following his February 2019 bladder cancer surgery. However, at that Janaury 2023 examiantion, the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have voiding dysufnction (including urine leakage, urinary frequency, or renal dysfunction. The first time thee symptoms were documented or reported was in the Veteran's June 26, 2023 claim. Thus, the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a 20 percent rating prior to the date of the Veteran's June 26, 2023 claim for increase. For this reason, the claim must be denied.

A rating higher than 20 percent for residuals of bladder cancer.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an increased rating for his residuals of bladder cancer, currently rated as 20 percent disabling pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system. Diagnostic Code 7528 instructs to rate as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant. The criteria for voiding dysfunction and renal dysfunction are found in § 4.115a. As the record does not indicate that the Veteran has renal dysfunction, the Board finds the disability is most appropriately rated based on a voiding dysfunction.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, voiding dysfunction can be rated according to urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding. Regarding urine leakage, a 60 percent rating is warranted for requiring the use of an appliance or wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than four times per day. A 40 percent rating is warranted for requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed two to four times per day. A 20 percent rating for voiding dysfunction is warranted for requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than two times per day. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

Voiding dysfunction that manifests as urinary frequency warrants a 40 percent rating when daytime voiding intervals are less than one hour or awakening to void (nocturia) occurs five or more times per night. A 20 percent rating contemplates daytime voiding intervals between one and two hours, or nocturia occurs three to four times per night. Id.

Voiding dysfunction that manifests as obstructed voiding warrants a 30 percent rating when urinary retention requires intermittent or continuous catheterization. A 10 percent rating contemplates marked obstructive symptomatology, such as hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream, with any one or combination of the following: (1) post-void residuals greater than 150 cc.; (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate, less than 10 cc./second; (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every two to three months.

A review of the record demonstrates a rating of 20 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's residuals of bladder cancer beginning June 26, 2023, to present.

The Veteran underwent VA urinary tract conditions examinations in January 2023 and July 2023. At the January 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported undergoing a transurethal resection of bladder tumor procedure in 2019 and a 2019 malignant neoplasm of bladder diagnosis. The Veteran did not report any current symptoms or current treatment. The examiner did not indicate that the Veteran's residuals of bladder cancer included voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction. 

At the July 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran had voiding dysfunction which caused urinary frequency, but did not cause urine leakage or obstructed voiding. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's urinary frequency includes daytime voiding intervals between one and two hours and nighttime voiding three to four times per night. Catheterization was not noted to be required. Renal dysfunction was not noted.

Based on this evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of bladder cancer are not met. The evidence clearly shows that the Veteran experienced frequency of voiding; indeed, the Veteran's June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ contended that he had to wake 3 times per night to void, which is consistent with the assigned 20 percent rating. However, the evidence does not show that he experienced urine leakage of any kind, daytime voiding interval of less than one hour or awakening to void five or more times per night, or any obstructed voiding, which would warrant a higher rating based on voiding dysfunction. Rather, as discussed above, his urine frequency was a daytime voiding interval of between one and two hours and awakening to void no more than three to four times per night. Additionally, the Veteran did not report and there was no documentation of renal dysfunction. Accordingly, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for residuals of bladder cancer are not met, and the appeal must be denied.

The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a higher rating. 38 U.S.C. 5107 (b), 38 C.F.R. § §§ 4.3, 4.7.
