FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On November 11, 2023, the Veteran's challenges to the propriety of the creation of an overpayment in the amount of $12,444 were granted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), and the Veteran was notified of the same by the AOJ's notification letter issued on November 13, 2023.

2. The Veteran's waiver claim is moot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is without subject matter jurisdiction over the Veteran's moot challenges to the propriety of the creation of the overpayment in the amount of $12,444. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7104, 7105.

2. The Board is without subject matter jurisdiction over the Veteran's moot claim for a waiver of the recoupment of the overpayment in the amount of $12,444. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7104, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty from April 1998 to February 2005. 

These matters come before the Board on his appeal from the December 2022 AOJ decision that charged the Veteran with an overpayment debt in the amount of $12,444 arising from the Veteran's delay in confirming the fact that K.N.A. and J.A. were his dependent minor children. The Veteran requested a waiver of the recoupment of this debt by filing his VA Form 21-5655, Financial Status Report (FSR), and also commenced the instant appeal of the AOJ's decision. 

However, on November 11, 2023, while this appeal was pending, the Veteran's challenges to the propriety of the creation of an overpayment in the amount of $12,444 were granted by the AOJ, and - after the Veteran was notified of the same by the AOJ's notification letter issued on November 13, 2023 - the debt was nullified. This development, in turn, rendered the Veteran's waiver claim moot. Correspondingly, the Veteran was notified that his waiver claim would not be adjudicated as moot. Given that every AOJ's action that nullified the Veteran's debt and deemed the Veteran's waiver claim moot qualified as an adjudication that the Board is required to factor into its analysis regardless of the scope of the Board's evidentiary review triggered by the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, the Board dismisses both claims on appeal as facially moot and, thus, rendering the Board without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; see also Frank v. Minnesota Newspaper Assoc., 490 U.S. 225, 227 (1989) (without a viable controversy, a challenge is moot); Dep't of Agric. v. Palmer, 68 M.S.P.R. 586, 588 89 (1995) (applying the doctrine of mootness in an
