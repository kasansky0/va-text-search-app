REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1981 to July 1983.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability.

The Veteran reported to his treating physician that he injured his back during service, but his pain when away for a while after being discharged. He stated that he thought a doctor injured him by sticking her thumb in his sacroiliac joint several years previously. See December 2021 VA treatment records.

During a January 2024 VA back examination, the examiner diagnosed degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and subacute compression fracture. The Veteran reported that his condition began at the end of 2013, but also that he fell in 1982, during service, and that years later his back gradually became sore.

The January 2024 VA examiner opined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's back disabilities were related to service because there was only a single service treatment record reflecting generalized arthralgia and no record specifically related to the back. The examiner stated that degeneration occurs because of age-related wear and tear on the spine. This opinion is inadequate because it relies on the absence of evidence in service treatment records and did not consider the Veteran's report of injuring his back during service. As a result, remand for a new examination is necessary.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran asserted that his back disability is secondary to his service-connected knee disabilities. See May 2024 Notice of Disagreement. However, this theory of entitlement was not raised prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. Thus, the Board may not remand for development. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Upon remand, the AOJ will have the opportunity to review all assertions presented.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should arrange for a VA examination of the Veteran to determine the nature and likely cause of any lumbar spine disability. The examiner should provide an opinion with detailed rationale that responds to the following:

For each lumbar spine disability diagnosed, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such disability was either incurred in or otherwise related to the Veteran's military service? Please explain why. The examiner must not rely solely on the absence of evidence in service treatment records without providing a proper foundation to do so and must consider the Veteran's report of injuring himself in service.
