ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

The appeal as to entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is dismissed.

Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), severe and recurrent with moderate alcohol use disorder, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The August 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) was submitted more than one year after the July 2022 and February 2023 rating decisions that addressed the Veteran's service connection claims for sleep apnea and migraines, respectively.

2. During the period under appellate review, the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested, overall, in an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, due to significant symptoms, e.g., suicidal ideation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, on the basis of a procedural defect, an untimely appeal, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105 (b)(1)(A) -(C), 7108.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, on the basis of a procedural defect, an untimely appeal, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105 (b)(1)(A) -(C), 7108.

3. The criteria for a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD and MDD, severe and recurrent with moderate alcohol use disorder, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 9411-9434.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1991 to April 1996.

The matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the rating decisions of July 2022 (pertaining to the service connection claim for sleep apnea, which was subject to a higher-level review (HLR) in October 2022), February 2023 (pertaining to the service connection claim for migraines) and July 2024 (pertaining to the non-initial rating claim for a psychiatric disability) issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the rating decisions on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted which the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

At the outset, the Board notes that it has been less than one year since the Veteran July 2024 rating decision. For appeals under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), such as in this case, an appellant "may modify the information identified in the Notice of Disagreement [NOD, a/k/a VA Form 10182] for the purpose of selecting a different evidentiary record option". 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). As the Veteran was advised in the September 2024 Board docketing letter, such requests "must be received at the Board within one year from the date that the [AOJ] mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later." Id.  Except in cases where an appellant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303, as this would preclude a docket switch under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), adjudication of the claim is not permitted before the time to modify the NOD expires. However, adjudication of the claim may proceed if the appellant waives the time constraints specified in § 20.202. See also Williams v. McDonough 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Here, in the December 2024 appellate brief, the Veteran's representative stated that there was no additional evidence to submit and specifically requested the Board to proceed with its adjudication of the claims at this time. As such, the Board accepts this request as the Veteran's waiver of § 20.202 and, thereby, allowing the Board to proceed with adjudicating the claims herein.

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is dismissed.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for his claimed sleep apnea and migraine headache disabilities. See August 2024 VA Form 10182.

By law, an NOD (VA Form 10182) must be filed within one year of the date that the applicable notice of a rating decision is issued. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A). This law is a mandatory claims-processing rule. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 265 (2024) (en banc) (considering the same section in its pre-amended, "legacy" version). When an NOD is not received within that time, the Board cannot entertain the request for review. 38 U.S.C. § 7108.

The Board may dismiss an appeal for non-compliance with essential claims-processing rules. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021); Ferko, supra (while the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction due to an untimely filing of an appeal, it may dismiss the appeal due to non-jurisdictional reasons, such as procedural defects, where the appellant did not substantially comply with proper claims processing rules).

Here, service connection for sleep apnea was last denied in a July 2022 rating decision, and was subject to HLR in October 2022. Notice of the July 2022 and October 2022 HLR rating decisions were mailed to the Veteran in July 2022 and October 2022, respectively, wherein he was provided instructions as to how to proceed with his claim if he disagreed with the rating decisions. However, the Veteran made no further movement on this claim until almost two years later with his August 2024 VA Form 10182.

Regarding his service connection for claim for migraine headaches, it was last denied in a February 2023 rating decision based on the AOJ determining that new and relevant evidence had not been received since its previous denial of the claim in March 2015. In a February 2023 notice, VA advised him that if he disagreed with the February 2023 rating decision, he had one year from that decision to submit the specified documentation, depending on the review option the Veteran selects. Instead of selecting any of the review options and submitting its applicable application forms noted in the February 2023 notice, more than a year later, in March 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (Fully Developed Claim). In a May 2024 VA letter, the Veteran was advised that his March 2024 Fully Developed Claim regarding his claimed migraine was not the appropriate form to seek readjudication of the claim and, therefore, it was not accepted. In that same letter, the Veteran was advised as to which form was needed for such readjudication, specifically, a Supplemental Claim, as the other options noted were no longer applicable in this case. However, instead of submitting a Supplemental Claim, the Veteran sought to directly appeal his claim to the Board with his untimely August 2024 VA Form 10182, received more than a year after the February 2023 rating decision that last denied his claim. 

Regarding the time limit for filing a VA Form 10182 (NOD), the law requires that it be filed within one year from the date notice of the related rating decision was mailed to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A).

On August 26, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 under the AMA appeals system and elected the Direct Review docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. In the VA Form 10182, the Veteran specified he was contesting rating decisions issued July 27, 2022 (regarding his sleep apnea), and October 17, 2023 (regarding his migraine disability). The Board notes that there is no October 2023 rating decision of record, and the last rating decision addressing his claimed migraine disability is the February 2023 rating decision.

While the Board may construe NODs liberally, the Veteran's intention here to appeal the rating decisions of October 2022 and February 2023, was unequivocal, as they were the last rating decisions that respectively addressed his asserted claims and may not be construed otherwise.

A question as to timeliness or adequacy of the NOD (VA Form 10182) shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(C). Here, the Board finds that the VA Form 10182 is untimely and therefore procedurally deficient. The Veteran has not asserted, nor demonstrated, good cause for why the deadline to submit a timely VA Form 10182 should be extended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b); Ferko, supra at 262.  Furthermore, the Board has not waived enforcement of the one-year time limit, as noted in its September 2024 docketing letter, wherein the Veteran was alerted that "[a]lthough [his] appeal has been docketed, it is possible that upon more detailed review the Board will determine [his] appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements. Those procedural requirements may include, but are not limited to, timely submitting [his] appeal request and adequately completing the VA Form 10182.  If the Board identifies such a defect, it may issue a decision dismissing [his] appeal based on that defect". 38 U.S.C.§ 7105 (b)(1)(C). Likewise, enforcement of the rule has not been forfeited since this is the first opportunity for the Board to apply the law to the facts of the Veteran's case. There are no other relevant factors that would support not enforcing the rule in this case. See Ferko, supra at 267 (for the holding that the one year deadline "is an 'important and mandatory' component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule (quoting Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, at 435 (2011)) [and that such] a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced" (quoting Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017)); hence, "VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness"). As previously stated, the Veteran has not requested nor shown good cause as to why the one-year time requirement be extended. Furthermore, the Board was clear in its September 2024 docketing letter to the Veteran, that this claim-processing rule was not forfeited but preserved so the Board could review the record to determine the appropriate outcome for the appealed issues. In sum, the untimeliness of the filing of the NOD is a procedural defect in complying with a mandatory claims-processing rule and is a distinct basis for dismissing the appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105 (b)(1)(A), 7108.

Accordingly, as there is no evidence showing good cause for waiver of the claims-processing rule, the appealed service connection claims for sleep apnea and migraine headaches must be dismissed. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptoms with criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 C.F.R. Part 4. They are based on average impairment in earning capacity resulting from the service-connected disabilities, as far as can be practicably determined. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1. In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). 

For initial increased rating claims, those stemming from the decision granting service connection, the most relevant evidence is "the evidence of record from the time of a veteran's application" for service connection. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 at 127 (1999). For non-initial increased rating claims, as in this case, which are those that are other than those stemming from the decision that granted service connection, "the present level of disability is of primary concern." Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). In addition, for such non-initial increased rating claims, "[t]he relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased-rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim." Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, at 509 (2007); 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

"Staged" ratings are appropriate for an increased-rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms warranting different ratings irrespective of whether an initial or established rating. Hart, supra; see also Fenderson, at 126 (applying this concept to initial ratings). The effective date of an award of increased compensation should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of an examination. Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the earliest date that it is ascertainable that an increase in disability first manifested. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

In all rating evaluations, each disability is to be viewed "in relation to its history" to "accurately reflect the elements of disability present". 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012); see also Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (discussing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1 and 4.2 and stating that, although the veteran was "only entitled to disability compensation for the period after ... the date he filed his original claim for benefits," VA regulations still require that the claim be evaluated in light of its whole recorded history. In Schafrath, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) explained that "[t]hese requirements for evaluation of the complete medical history of the claimant's condition operate to protect claimants against adverse decisions based on a single, incomplete or inaccurate report and to enable VA to make a more precise evaluation of the level of the disability and of any changes in the condition." Schafrath, at 594. As such, VA should interpret reports of examination "in light of the whole recorded history", reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability shall be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, the higher of the two should be assigned where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. In general, it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

3. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD and MDD, severe and recurrent with moderate alcohol use disorder, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher rating than 70 percent for his service-connected psychiatric disability. See August 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran was granted service connection for his psychiatric disability in a December 2019 rating decision. Pursuant to the Veteran's May 2024 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran seeks a higher evaluation than his current 70 percent rating. Given that this is a non-initial rating claim, in that it does not stem from the rating decision that granted service connection, "the present level of disability is of primary concern." Francisco, supra. In addition, in such a case, the Board shall focus its review of the evidence regarding the severity of the disability from the period one year before his May 2024 Fully Developed Claim, that is, from May 2023. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, at 509 (2007); 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

During the appeal period under review, the Veteran's psychiatric disability is rated as 70 percent disabling pursuant to the criteria set forth in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula) as described in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DCs 9411-9434. A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DCs 9411-9434.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. Id.

When evaluating a mental disorder, the rating agency shall consider the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remissions, and the capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment, rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.

The "such symptoms as" language of the diagnostic codes for mental disorders in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 means "for example" and does not represent an exhaustive list of symptoms that must be found before granting the rating of that category. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). However, as the Court also pointed out in that case, "[w]ithout those examples, differentiating a 30% evaluation from a 50% evaluation would be extremely ambiguous." Id. The Court went on to state that the list of examples "provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating." Id. Accordingly, while each of the examples needs not be proven in any one case, the particular symptoms must be analyzed in light of those given examples. Put another way, the severity represented by those examples may not be ignored.

The Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria under the General Rating Formula. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

As explained below, the Board finds that the Veteran experiences occupational and social impairment that are approximated with the level of deficiencies in most areas but are less than total. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed, in pertinent part, the June 2024 VA psychiatric examination, VA examinations regarding other disabilities, medical treatment records, and the Veteran's statements, and found that they indicate the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 70 percent rating.

Turning to the evidence of record, from about one year prior to the Veteran's May 2024 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran attended a VA psychiatric examination March 2023. During this examination, the Veteran reported that his mental health had worsened and that he has "anger issues ... [and] problems with dealing with little things", and that he drinks to manage his psychiatric symptoms. He reported that he "wants things perfect because in military he had to be perfect, or someone died". He reported that his wife is cautious, feeling as if she needs to walk on eggshells around him. He reported that he does not communicate well, or often. He reported nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and anxiety around people. He reported occasional panic attacks, triggered by anxiety and stress. He reported that "his work makes him triggered because of the uncertainty" and that "his in-laws are waiting for him to fail". He reported low motivation, low energy, lack of interest in things he used to like to do. He does not socialize much and claims that he has lost friends because of his psychiatric disability.  He reported being hypervigilant.  He also reported problems with memory, e.g., remembering names, directions, and tasks. The examiner observed that the Veteran "was cooperative and had good eye contact. Hygiene was good, dressed well. The Veteran was forthcoming, flat affect, problems with depression. Thinks about suicide but has no plans at this time. He has protective factors of wife, children, family. ... He was coherent, logical and oriented to time and place". 

For VA rating purposes, the examiner noted that the Veteran manifests the following symptoms: depressed mood, anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; near-continuous depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; impairment of short and long term memory, for example, retention of only highly learned material, while forgetting to complete tasks; flattened effect; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting; suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; and, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene. The examiner noted that the Veteran's psychiatric disability, that previously included the diagnoses of PTSD and alcohol use disorder, had progressed to now also include MDD. The examiner's overall assessment of the Veteran's psychiatric severity level was that it manifested as an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. As a result of this examiner's noted disability progression and assessment, the Veteran's psychiatric disability rating was increased to its current 70 percent level, in a March 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DCs 9411-9434. 

In the most recent VA psychiatric examination of June 2024, the Veteran reported "that he has been engaging in some reckless personal behavior". Specifically, "that he is currently drinking more than he would like, most days, about half a bottle to one bottle of wine. He reports that any note recording no problematic ETOH use is an error or a misunderstanding". The examiner noted that the Veteran was late for the exam and that the Veteran "reported that he finds these examinations very stressful ... the whole claims process very exhausting". The examiner observed the Veteran "initially displayed some suspiciousness and occasional irritability, consistent with symptom report of having issues with irritability. Rapport was built and he was able to fully engage with the process". The examiner noted that the Veteran is capable of managing his own financial affairs. For rating purposes, the examiner noted that the Veteran manifests the following symptoms: depressed mood, anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; near-continuous depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; flattened effect; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation and mood; and suicidal ideation. The examiner noted that the Veteran's suicidal ideation was passive, with no intent or plan, and at a low acute risk. The examiner assessed that the Veteran's overall severity level of his psychiatric disability was that of an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood, which is consistent with the criteria of a 70 percent rating under DCs 9411-9434. 

VA treatment records reflect the Veteran's report of feeling anxious and depressed nearly every day and having low motivation, difficulty with relaxing, restlessness, and difficulty with concentration and focus. See February 2024 VA treatment records.

The Board also notes that a number of the Veteran's symptoms, as reported during VA examinations and in VA treatment records, are not listed in the General Rating Formula, e.g., irritability, anger, isolation, low motivation, restlessness, reckless behavior, perfectionism, nightmares, hypervigilance, difficulty with concentration and focus, and inability to communicate well. See March 2023 and June 2024 VA psychiatric examinations; and February 2024 VA treatment records. However, the Board finds these unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms of anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, impaired judgment, suspiciousness, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in understanding complex commands, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships which are symptoms associated with either a 30 or 50 percent rating. 

In completing its analysis, the Board does not find any evidence of record to support a finding that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms warrant a higher rating of 100 percent. No where in the record is there evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms manifested in symptoms, e.g., gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Nor are the Veteran's stated symptoms on par with the level of severity contemplated by the total rating.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms; however, he is not competent to report that his mental health symptoms are of sufficient severity to warrant a specific rating under VA's tables for rating such disabilities because such an opinion requires medical expertise which he has not been shown to have. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). 

The Board has assessed and considered the medical and lay evidence of record, to include the Veteran's documented behavior and the frequency, intensity, and duration of all his reported psychiatric symptoms, as listed in the General Rating Formula and in combination with those that are not listed. After considering the effects of his psychiatric disability on his daily life, along with the balance of the record, the Board finds that a rating of no higher than 70 percent has been approximated.

The Board finds the effect of symptoms associated with the Veteran's psychiatric disability during the appellate period under review, as explained above, persuasively weighs against finding a rating higher than 70 percent to warrant the application of the benefit of the doubt doctrine in the Veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert, supra; Lynch, supra. As such, the Board finds his symptoms, specific to his psychiatric disability, most nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (the 70 percent level). 

In sum, the evidence of record supports a finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a 70 percent rating, but not higher. Therefore, a non-initial rating higher than 70 percent is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claim is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
