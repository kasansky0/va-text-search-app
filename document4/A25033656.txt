DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for hyperacusis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hyperacusis is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hyperacusis are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to May 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Service connection for hyperacusis

The Veteran contends that his hyperacusis is related to his military service. Specifically, during his service, the Veteran worked as pneumatics mechanic working on jet engines on the flight line. He alleges the constant loud engine noise damaged his ears.

Service treatment records (STRs) show the Veteran had hearing problems due to jet engine noise that bothered him despite wearing hearing protection in December 1970. He also had pain and hearing problems associated with jet engine noise in 1972. The Veteran's separation examination notes trouble with his ear from tinnitus in 1970 that developed after working on the flight line.

The Veteran first filed a claim for hearing loss in 1986 due to his work as an aircraft mechanic. On VA examination in April 1987, it was noted he had experienced nervousness since working with the noise of aircraft and people yelling and shouting. His claim was denied as he did not have hearing loss upon testing at the time. 

In a September 1999 VA examination, the Veteran complained of difficulty understanding conversations. On examination, his ears and hearing were normal, however, the examiner stated he did not know the source of the Veteran's difficulty hearing. 

The Veteran was granted service connection for tinnitus in a February 2002 rating decision based on his complaints of tinnitus in service. 

Most recently, in an April 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he sustained ear damage from working as an aircraft mechanic. He reported that he has a reaction to high frequency sounds, from an 18-wheeler, for example, that makes "me want to crawl out of my skin." The examiner stated that the Veteran does not have hyperacusis, but rather Meniere's disease. He opined that the Veteran's Meniere's disease is less likely than not due to his service-connected tinnitus. The examiner explained that Meniere's disease can lead to vertigo and tinnitus, but it is not due to tinnitus. The Board finds the April 2020 VA opinion to be inadequate as the examiner did not provide a direct service connection opinion based on the Veteran's in-service complaints of nervousness around loud noises, nor did she acknowledge the VA treatment records that show complaints of hyperacusis for the past 40 years. 

The April 2020 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran' had a qualifying in-service injury, as hearing problems were noted in 1972. The AOJ also found that the Veteran was diagnosed with hyperacusis, as noted in VA treatment records dated December 2019. 

The Veteran testified at the July 2014 Board hearing that he was exposed to loud noises from jet engines for hours during service and it made him nervous and on edge. He sought help, but the doctors did not know what to do to treat him. He noted that his condition is unique because it is difficult to test for hypersensitivity to noise.

The Veteran submitted a private evaluation in February 2025. The provider stated that while the Veteran has documentation of tinnitus, he also had the presence of hyperacusis during military service. He noted the noise exposure experienced by the Veteran caused him to develop metabolic syndrome from altered stress hormones. He opined that a central neurological cause within the brain is more likely than not the cause of his condition of hyperacusis, which occurs in response to brain injury.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current hyperacusis is related to service. The Veteran had an in-service injury from noise exposure, he has a diagnosis of hyperacusis and there is competent medical evidence of a link to service. 

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for hyperacusis is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
