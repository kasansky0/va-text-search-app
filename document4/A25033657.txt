ORDER

An effective date of August 28, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo is granted.

An initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected vestibular migraine is denied.

A separate, initial 30 percent rating for vertigo associated with service-connected vestibular migraine is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 28, 2020, VA received an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation from the Veteran followed by a complete claim received on August 7, 2021, in which she sought entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

2. While that claim of service connection for tinnitus was pending for evidentiary development, on August 31, 2021, the Veteran amended her claim to include service connection for dizziness with occasional staggering secondary to tinnitus.

3. Service connection for vestibular migraine with vertigo was granted on the basis of medical opinion evidence indicating that it was caused by, or proximately due to, service-connected tinnitus.

4. The migraine headache symptoms of the Veteran's vestibular migraine disability have been manifested by, at worst, completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain occurring more than once per month and lasting less than one day along with nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and vision changes.

5. The vertigo portion of that disability has been manifested by dizziness and occasional staggering on objective examinations. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 28, 2020, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected vestibular migraines have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 3.321, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. 

3. The criteria for a separate, initial 30 percent rating for vertigo associated with service-connected vestibular migraines have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.20, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1992 to July 1995.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which granted service connection for vertigo and assigned an initial 10 percent rating effective June 11, 2024. 

On August 12, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) on which she identified the July 2024 rating decision as the decision she wished to appeal and elected the Direct review option; she specifically disagreed with the issues of the initial 10 percent rating assigned for vertigo and the assigned effective date of June 11, 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.   

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Also, the Board has considered Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that generally the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch has elapsed.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) (providing that claimants may switch dockets by completing and submitting a new NOD within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303).  To the extent the holding in Williams applies in the case, the Board notes that along with her August 12, 2024, NOD or Board Appeal, the Veteran explicitly "waive[d] the one-year docket period to switch dockets."

The Board notes that after the rating decision on appeal, in an August 2024 rating decision, the RO found clear and unmistakable errors in the July 2024 rating decision with respect to the characterization of the Veteran's service-connected disability, the effective date for the award of service connection for that disability, and the initial disability rating assigned.  As a result, in the August 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for "vestibular migraines with vertigo" and assigned an initial 50 percent disability rating effective August 31, 2021.

As explained above, in this appeal, the evidentiary record before the Board is limited to the evidence considered by the AOJ at the time of the July 2024 rating decision.  The assignment of a higher initial rating of 50 percent from the earlier effective date of August 31, 2021, for the disability recharacterized from simply vertigo to the more accurate diagnosed disability of vestibular migraines with vertigo, however, is not evidence but an adjudicative action.  Moreover, the Board is bound by this favorable finding absent clear and unmistakable evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Finally, because the Veteran's vertigo is a separate and distinct manifestation of her service-connected vestibular migraine disability, as explained below, and because the Board finds that a separate compensable rating is warranted for her vertigo, the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for vestibular migraine as reflected on the cover page of this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 31, 2021, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo

On August 28, 2020, VA received an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation from the Veteran, followed by a complete claim filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ on August 7, 2021, in which she sought service connection for tinnitus.  In an accompanying statement, she elaborated that she was not applying for hearing loss because a recent audiological evaluation at Walter Reed demonstrated that her hearing "does not meet the VA criteria for hearing loss."  She did not seek service connection for any other disability.  

In connection with her claim of service connection for tinnitus, the Veteran was afforded a VA fee-basis examination on August 31, 2021.  When questioned about the functional impact of her tinnitus on her daily activities, the Veteran reported that when her tinnitus gets bad, she gets dizzy and veers to the left side.  She also indicated that she had had vertigo two years earlier.  

On August 31, 2021, the same day as the examination, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ on which the Veteran sought service connection for dizziness with occasional staggering secondary to tinnitus.  She indicated that she was "amending [her] claim for tinnitus to include dizziness and occasional staggering, secondary to tinnitus after speaking to the audiologist about [her] symptoms."  In an accompanying statement, the Veteran claimed that after talking with a VA audiologist about her dizziness with occasional staggering and stumbling as well as vertigo earlier in the day, she wanted to add a secondary service connection claim to her claim for tinnitus.  She elaborated that her tinnitus began in July 1992, her dizziness began in March 1993 with a very bad sinus infection, and both continued intermittently since separation from service.  She indicated that currently her vertigo occurred intermittently every few months and lasted for three to four hours at a time. 

In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for tinnitus effective August 28, 2020, which is the date VA received the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, followed by her complete claim on August 7, 2021.  The RO deferred a decision on the pending claim of service connection for dizziness pending additional development.  

As part of that development, the Veteran was afforded a VA fee-basis examination in September 2021.  The diagnosis was Meniere's syndrome (endolymphatic hydrops) and dizziness of unclear etiology.  A September 2021 rating decision denied service connection for Meniere's syndrome with dizziness.  In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), VA Form 20-0996, seeking review of the September 2021 rating decision.  A December 2022 HLR rating decision determined that a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error had been identified in the September 2021 rating decision.  After completing development to correct the pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, a November 2023 rating decision denied service connection for vestibular migraine with vertigo.  In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995, seeking review of the November 2023 rating decision.  The July 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for vertigo associated with tinnitus and assigned a 10 percent rating effective June 11, 2024.  As noted above, an August 2024 rating decision found clear and unmistakable errors in the July 2024 rating decision and granted service connection for vestibular migraine with vertigo and assigned an initial 50 percent rating effective August 31, 2021, the date of receipt of the claim.  Again, the Board is bound by the favorable findings from the August 2024 adjudication of her claim.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of service connection and compensation based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim will be the "date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  

An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1).  An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit.  Id. § 3.1(p)(1)(i).

A claimant may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160 [defining the elements of a complete claim], appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim can be submitted by a saved electronic application; by submission to an AOJ of a signed and dated intent to file a claim on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose; and by oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing.  Id. § 3.155(b)(1)(i)-(iii).  An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  Id. § 3.155(c). 

VA will not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension).  If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior intent to file will have no effect.  If, however, VA receives an intent to file followed by a complete claim and later another intent to file for the same benefit is submitted within 1 year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent intent to file.  Id. § 3.155(b)(6).   

Given the evidence of record and the applicable legal criteria, the Board finds that an effective date of August 28, 2020, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo is warranted.

As set forth above, the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim was received on August 28, 2020.  This was followed by the Veteran's claim of service connection for tinnitus received on August 7, 2021.  While that claim was pending additional development required by VA's duty to assist, on August 31, 2021, the Veteran indicated that she wished to amend her claim to include service connection for dizziness with occasional staggering (now diagnosed and service-connected as vestibular migraine), secondary to tinnitus.  (Parenthetically, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued her claim of service connection for vestibular migraine with vertigo since VA received it on August 31, 2021.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) (outlining how a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue)).  

Although the Veteran did not raise the issue of service connection for vertigo until August 31, 2021, the Board finds issue was within the scope of the claim of service connection for tinnitus.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the scope of a claim includes not only issues raised in the pleadings but also the entire evidentiary record as the case develops over time.  Schroeder v. West, 212 F.3d 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545 (2008); Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009); see also DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011) ("Overall, the scope of the claim will be based on a sympathetic assessment of "the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of the claim," i.e. the information gathered upon investigation.").  VA regulations also recognize that evidentiary development can change the scope of a claim:  "Once VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).    

As a result, the Board finds that an effective date of August 28, 2020, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo is warranted, corresponding to the date of receipt of the claim of service connection for tinnitus, because the former issue was within the scope of the tinnitus claim.  This is because while VA was conducting evidentiary development in connection with the pending claim of service connection for tinnitus, the Veteran raised vertigo as an ancillary benefit and the development conducted by VA resulted in evidence of a nexus between the two conditions.  In that regard, in the September 2021 rating decision granting service connection for tinnitus, the RO also deferred a decision on the claim of service connection for vertigo and further recognized the date of receipt of the claim as August 7, 2021, the date of the complete application following the August 28, 2020, Intent to File.  

Having determined the date of receipt of the claim, the Board next finds that the date entitlement to service connection arose was prior to the date of receipt of the claim.  During a July 2022 evaluation with an otolaryngologist, the appellant disclosed a history of vertigo since 2019 and a history of migraine headaches.  The otolaryngologist explained that the symptoms were most likely related to central vestibulopathy such as vestibular migraine.  In other words, the otolaryngologist confirmed a diagnosis of vestibular migraine with vertigo that had a reported onset of 2019, and which VA fee-basis examiners later opined was secondary to service-connected tinnitus.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[l]ay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional"). 

In summary, competent and credible evidence reflects an onset of vertigo symptoms in 2019, that were later confirmed by competent medical and opinion evidence to be attributable to a vestibular migraine disability, of which vertigo is a manifestation.  As the claim of service connection was received after the date of onset of the disability, an effective date from the later date of receipt of the claim is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The evidence contains no indication, nor has the Veteran contended, that she filed an earlier claim of service connection.  Thus, criteria for an effective date of August 28, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for vestibular migraines with vertigo have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected vestibular migraine with vertigo

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to a 100 percent disability rating for her service-connected vestibular migraine with vertigo under Diagnostic Codes 8100-6205.

Regarding the nature of the service-connected disability on appeal, the Veteran initially filed a claim of service connection for "dizziness with occasional staggering" secondary to tinnitus.  Following a September 2021 VA fee-basis ear conditions examination, the diagnosis was Meniere's syndrome and dizziness of unclear etiology.  In July 2022, she presented for evaluation with a private otolaryngologist, W. Kim, M.D., with complaints of spinning vertigo since 2019 triggered by motion and lasting up to four hours, imbalance, and sound sensitivities.  She described a history of migraines, which occurred once a year since age 50, stating that the migraines were much more frequent before menopause.  On examination, her ears were normal, and audiogram was within normal limits.  Vestibular examination revealed positive Romberg test (indicating impaired balance) and negative Dix-Hallpike test.  Dr. Kim explained that the Veteran's history and examination were not consistent with peripheral vestibulopathy or inner ear pathology.  Instead, her vertigo was most likely related to central vestibulopathy, such as vestibular migraine.  Subsequent VA fee-basis ear conditions examinations in March 2023 and July 2024 diagnosed vestibular migraine with vertigo and linked this disability to her service-connected tinnitus. 

For clarity, "vestibular migraine" is a "syndrome characterized by recurrent episodes of vertigo or other vestibular symptoms attributed to migraine."  See UpToDate, "Vestibular Migraine," Carrie Elizabeth Robertson, MD, Scott D. Eggers, MD, last updated Jan. 14, 2025, available at https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-migraine (last visited Mar. 31, 2025).  Clinical symptoms of vestibular migraine include episodic vertigo; "migrainous headaches [] associated with at least some of the vestibular episodes in 50 to 94 percent of patients;" and "other ictal features" such as photophobia, phonophobia, and visual aura.  Id.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous.  Conjectural analogies will be avoided, as will the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings.  Nor will ratings assigned to organic diseases and injuries be assigned by analogy to conditions of functional origin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

In general, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  When the appeal arises from an initial assigned rating, consideration must be given to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Here, analysis in this decision has therefore been undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

The Veteran's vestibular migraine with vertigo is rated as 50 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, which pertains to migraines.  Under these criteria, a maximum rating of 50 percent is assigned for migraine with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Id.

Although DC 8100 pertaining to migraine does not describe specific migraine symptoms, but instead rates migraine disability based on the frequency, severity, and duration of attacks, some of the Veteran's symptoms appear to be attributable to the migraine headache features of her disability, and thus contemplated by the 50 percent disability rating assigned under DC 8100 while the vertigo associated with her vestibular migraine disability is a separate and distinct manifestation.  The Board notes that "migraine" is defined as 

an often familial symptom complex of periodic attacks of vascular headache, usually temporal and unilateral in onset, commonly associated with irritability, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and often with photophobia.  Attacks are preceded by constriction of the cranial arteries, often with resultant prodromal sensory (especially ocular) symptoms and the spreading depression of Leão; the migraines themselves commence with the vasodilation that follows.  The two types are distinguished, [migraine] with aura and [migraine] without aura. 

Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1166 (32d ed. 2012).

The Veteran has been in receipt of the highest schedular initial rating for the migraine headache manifestation of her disability under DC 8100, and there is no basis to award a higher rating under these criteria.  

During the period under review, the Veteran was afforded VA and fee-basis examinations in September 2021 (ear conditions, including vestibular), March 2023 (ear conditions, including vestibular), April 2023 (hearing loss), and July 2024 (ear conditions, including vestibular, and headaches, including migraine headaches).  In addition, she submitted private treatment records and identified VA treatment records, which the AOJ obtained.  Throughout the period under review, the migraine headache manifestation of her vestibular migraine disability has been manifested at worst by pulsating or throbbing head pain on both sides of her head, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and vision changes with completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine pain occurring more than once per month and lasting less than one day.  See July 2024 fee-basis migraine examination report.  As to whether the Veteran's migraine headache attacks are productive of severe economic inadaptability, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has been employed on a full-time basis.  During the March 2023 ear conditions examination, she reported missing two to four weeks of work over the last 12-month period, stating that she is unable to function when the vertigo attacks are bad due to the spinning and dizzy feeling being disruptive. During the July 2024 headaches and ear conditions examinations, she indicated that her symptoms cause difficulty focusing and completing tasks and decreased productivity.  

In considering whether separate ratings may be warranted for the documented symptoms attributable to the Veteran's vestibular migraine disability, the Board emphasizes that the evaluation of the same manifestations of a disability under different diagnoses, a process called "pyramiding," is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Where the record reflects that the appellant has multiple problems due to a service-connected disability or disabilities, it is possible for an appellant to have "separate and distinct manifestations" permitting separate ratings.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994).  The critical element is that none of the symptomatology for any of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other conditions.  Id.  

Here, because the Veteran's vertigo is a separate and distinct manifestation of her vestibular migraine disability and is not contemplated by DC 8100 for evaluating migraine disabilities generally, the Board finds that a separate compensable rating is warranted for the vertigo associated with her service-connected vestibular migraine disability.

Specifically, although her vestibular migraine has been identified as a central vestibulopathy rather than a peripheral vestibular disorder, the Board finds that her vertigo is properly rated by analogy by DC 6204, which pertains to peripheral vestibular disorders.  Under these criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for occasional dizziness, and a maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for dizziness with occasional staggering.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6204.  Objective findings supporting the diagnosis of vestibular disequilibrium are required before a compensable evaluation can be assigned under this code. Hearing impairment or suppuration shall be separately rated and combined.  Id. at Note.

During the September 2021 VA fee-basis ear conditions examination, the Veteran described a 2019 onset of her first vertigo attack, perceived as the room spinning.  She reported experiencing vertigo every few months since then, usually first thing in the morning and lasting a few hours, accompanied by dizziness.  On physical examination, Romberg testing was positive, demonstrating unsteadiness.  Dix-Hallpike testing was normal, demonstrating no current vertigo or nystagmus during the test.  During the March 2023 VA fee-basis ear conditions examination, she endorsed episodes of vertigo occurring four times per week with more severe episodes twice per week.  She denied using any medications for her symptoms.  On examination, her gait was observed to be unsteady; she staggered, not in a straight line, and was unable to walk the entire hallway without holding the wall intermittently.  Romberg testing was positive for unsteadiness, Dix-Hallpike testing was positive for vertigo within ten seconds, and limb coordination was abnormal while standing but normal while sitting.

Having considered the medical and lay evidence of record, the Board finds that the vertigo manifestation of the service-connected vestibular migraine disability warrants a separate, 30 percent rating under DC 6204 based on objective findings documenting dizziness and occasional staggering.  This is the maximum rating available under DC 6204.  

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to diseases of the ear.  Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability.  See Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 261-62; see also Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).  Disabilities specifically listed in the rating schedule may only be rated under Diagnostic Codes which specifically pertain to them.  Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336 (2015)).  Unlisted conditions may be rated by analogy to Diagnostic Codes that may not describe the unlisted disability but addresses disabilities that may be productive of similar symptoms.  Scott, 920 F.3d at 1375 (citing Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 493 (2016).  

The Veteran has asserted that her vestibular migraine with vertigo should be rated under DC 8100-6205 and that a 100 percent disability rating is warranted.  Diagnostic Code 6205 is used to evaluate Meniere's syndrome (endolymphatic hydrops).  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6205.  

Under DC 6205 for evaluating Meniere's syndrome, a 30 percent rating is assigned for hearing impairment with vertigo less than once a month, with or without tinnitus.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring from one to four times a month, with or without tinnitus.  A 100 percent rating is assigned for hearing impairment with attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly, with or without tinnitus.  Id.  Finally, Meniere's syndrome is to be evaluated either under the criteria under Diagnostic Code 6205 or by separately evaluating vertigo (as a peripheral vestibular disorder), hearing impairment, and tinnitus, whichever method results in a higher overall evaluation.  But do not combine an evaluation for hearing impairment, tinnitus, or vertigo with an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 6205.  Id. at Note.

The Board finds that the Veteran's vestibular migraine with vertigo is not properly rated under the criteria for evaluating Meniere's disease because competent medical evidence of record shows she does not have impaired hearing for VA compensation purposes, which is required for a 30, 60, or 100 percent disability rating under DC 6205.

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (dB) or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 dB or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

A March 2021 audiogram from Walter Reed National Military Center reflects that puretone thresholds in both ears at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz were recorded as 10, 10, 10, 15, and 20 dB respectively.  Outside the range of puretone thresholds that VA considers when determining whether hearing impairment exists, puretone thresholds at 6000 Hz were recorded as 30 dB bilaterally, and puretone thresholds at 8000 Hz were recorded as 45 dB for the right ear and 35 dB for the left ear.  Word recognition testing was performed but does not reflect which test was used.  In any event, word recognition scores were reported as 100 percent in each ear.

The report of a July 2022 evaluation by a private otolaryngologist indicates that the Veteran's "audiogram is within normal limits."  The "Treatment" section of the report listed "sensorineural hearing loss of right ear with unrestricted hearing of left ear" and appeared to order a comprehensive audio threshold test with word recognition testing.  A report of audiological testing was not associated with the July 2022 otolaryngologist's report.

An April 2023 VA fee-basis Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects that puretone thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz were recorded for the right ear as 5, 0, 5, 15, and 20 dB respectively, and for the left ear as 0, 0, 0, 10, 15 dB respectively.  Outside the range of puretone thresholds that VA considers when determining whether hearing impairment exists, puretone thresholds at 6000 and 8000 Hz were recorded for the right ear as 45 and 25 dB respectively, and for the left ear as 35 and 35 dB respectively.  Speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC were reported as 100 percent for the right ear and 98 percent for the left ear.  Although the April 2023 fee-basis audiologist diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the frequency range of 6000 Hertz or higher frequencies, the Board emphasizes that for VA purposes, the diagnosis of hearing impairment is based upon testing at the frequency ranges of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In support of her claim seeking service connection for vestibular migraine with vertigo, the Veteran submitted a May 2024 medical opinion report from her private primary care physician, M. Roberts, M.D.  The report indicates that Dr. Roberts reviewed lay statements from the Veteran and her spouse, her service treatment records, VA treatment records, and examination reports.  Dr. Roberts noted that an April 2023 VA examination diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and recurrent tinnitus.  After considering the evidence provided to her, Dr. Roberts opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's current vestibular migraine, which is a central vestibulopathy, was a progression of the migraine headaches that she experienced starting in 1994 while on active duty.  In addition, Dr. Roberts believed that the vestibular migraine disability was best rated by analogy under DC 6205 for Meniere's syndrome "as this encompasses attacks of vertigo and cerebellar gait occurring more than once weekly, with or without tinnitus," adding that her disability warrants a "total rating given her symptoms as above and as reported to me as symptoms that occur more than twice weekly with vertigo attacks."

To the extent that Dr. Roberts observed that an April 2023 VA examination diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the Board reiterates that the results of that examination clearly demonstrated that the Veteran does not have a current hearing loss disability as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  In turn, the Board finds that the Veteran's vestibular migraine with vertigo may not be rated analogously under the criteria for evaluating Meniere's syndrome at DC 6205 because those criteria require the presence of "impaired hearing," which the Veteran does not have.

Although the Veteran had contended that she is entitled to a 100 percent schedular rating under DC 8100-6205, she has not sought a total rating based on individual unemployability nor is such a claim reasonably raised by the record.  The evidence before the Board reflects that the Veteran is employed on a full-time basis.  She has not asserted that she is unemployed or that she does not earn a gainful wage (i.e., below poverty level).   

The Board additionally finds that, having assigned the separate rating above for the Veteran's vertigo symptoms, there are no manifestations of the Veteran's disability unaccounted for by application of the schedular rating criteria, such that application of the schedular rating criteria would be rendered impractical.  Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008), aff'd, Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10.  The Board finds that application of the regular schedular standards is adequate to rate the service-connected disability and that the disability is not so exceptional or unusual as to render the schedular standards impractical.  38 C.F.R. 3.321(b)(1).  Thus, extra-schedular consideration is not warranted in this case.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record supports the assignment of a separate, initial 30 percent rating for vertigo associated with service-connected vestibular migraines.  The evidence  persuasively weighs against the assignment of an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for service-connected vestibular migraine.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against that portion of the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
