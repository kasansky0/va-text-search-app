FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension or Survivors Pension and/or DIC, was received on August 23, 2022; his initial claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was received on August 30, 2022, and August 23, 2022, and represents the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for his service-connected PTSD.

2. The Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 was received on October 27, 2022; his initial claim for service connection for migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus was received on April 24, 2023, and October 27, 2022, and represents the earliest possible effective date for the award of service connection for his service-connected migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus.

3. The effective date of award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits under Chapter 35 cannot be earlier than the effective date of grant of service connection for the underlying disabilities which, in this case, is August 23, 2022.

4. The Veteran's SMC based on loss of use of creative organ is based upon his service-connected erectile dysfunction.

5. The Veteran first met the criteria for SMC based on housebound criteria on October 27, 2022.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2000 to April 2003.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

I.  Effective Dates for the Award of Service Connection

Generally, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim or a claim reopened after a final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). This rulemaking also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Under the former regulations, any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Under former 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(a) (which was in effect prior to March 24, 2015), a report of examination or hospitalization would be accepted as an informal claim for increase or to reopen, if the report relates to a disability that may establish entitlement. However, there must first be a prior allowance or disallowance of a claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b) (2014).

VA is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.155(a). See also Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198-200 (1992). Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.

A.  PTSD

By way of background, on August 23, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension or Survivors Pension and/or DIC. Subsequently, on August 30, 2022, his formal claim for service connection for PTSD was received. See August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. In a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for his PTSD, effective August 23, 2022, the date his VA Form 21-0966 was received by VA.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran disagreed with the effective date assigned to the award of service connection for his PTSD, arguing that the appropriate effective date was when he first attempted to correct his character of discharge.  The Board notes that the Veteran's request to correct his character of discharge was received on January 25, 2022.

In reviewing the claims file, there is no communication received by VA prior to his August 23, 2022, VA Form 21-0966 that can be interpreted as a formal or informal service-connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  This includes the request to correct his character of discharge as such appears to have been completed by an employee at the Veterans Health Administration, and there is nothing to suggest that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder prior to when his August 23, 2022, VA Form 21-0966 was received. 

In the absence of a pending formal or informal claim for service connection that has been left unadjudicated by VA, the Board is constrained by the laws and regulations governing the assignment of effective dates from awarding the Veteran an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, for the award of service connection for his service-connected PTSD. As such, his claim must be denied.

B.  Migraines, Erectile Dysfunction, and Tinnitus 

By way of background, on October 27, 2022, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966. Subsequently, on April 24, 2023, his formal claim for service connection for migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus was received. See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for his migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus, effective April 24, 2023, the date his VA Form 21-526EZ was received by VA.

In the February 2024 higher level review decision, the AOJ awarded an earlier effective date of October 27, 2022, for the award of service connection for his migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus, the date his VA Form 21-526EZ was received by VA.

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran disagreed with the effective date assigned to the award of service connection for his migraines, erectile dysfunction, and tinnitus, arguing that the appropriate effective date was when he first attempted to correct his character of discharge.  The Board notes that the Veteran's request to correct his character of discharge was received on January 25, 2022.

In reviewing the claims file, there is no communication received by VA prior to his October 27, 2022, VA Form 21-0966 that can be interpreted as a formal or informal service-connection claim for migraines, erectile dysfunction, and/or tinnitus.  As noted above, this includes the request to correct his character of discharge as such appears to have been completed by an employee at the Veterans Health Administration, and there is nothing to suggest that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for migraines, erectile dysfunction, and/or tinnitus prior to his October 27, 2022, VA Form 21-0966. 

In so far as the Veteran's tinnitus was noted in a September 2022 VA audiology examination, it is further noted that 38 C.F.R. § 3.157 is not applicable, as that regulation was repealed, effective March 24, 2015, and the examination report was generated after that date. Even if the regulation was still effective at that time, medical records, including VA examination reports, cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection as no intent to file a claim was noted. See Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501 (2006); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (medical records cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection but rather there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for the benefit). Simply put, the Veteran filed no formal or informal claim for tinnitus prior to October 27, 2022.

In the absence of a pending formal or informal claim for service connection that has been left unadjudicated by VA, the Board is constrained by the laws and regulations governing the assignment of effective dates from awarding the Veteran an effective date earlier than October 27, 2022, for the award of service connection for his service-connected migraines, erectile dysfunction, and/or tinnitus. As such, his claims must be denied.

II. Effective Date for the Award of Basic Eligibility for DEA Benefits under Chapter 35

As noted above, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim or a claim reopened after a final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

The denial of an effective date earlier than August 23, 2022, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's PTSD precludes the assignment of an effective date prior to August 23, 2022, for the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits under Chapter 35.

For the purposes of DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the law provides that basic eligibility exists where a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a total disability permanent in nature as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021. With certain exceptions that are not applicable to the instant claim, the effective date for the grant of such award shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates for awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113(a).

Here, the currently assigned effective date of August 23, 2022, for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is directly related to the award of a 100 percent disability rating to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. Since eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is predicated on a finding of a total service-connected disability rating, permanent in nature, the effective date of such eligibility cannot precede August 23, 2022, the effective date of the award of service connection and the 100 percent disability rating assigned to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.

The Board further notes that the decision in this case is consistent with the recent holding of Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232 (2019), that compensation cannot be paid for a disability, at any evaluation level, before the effective date of service connection for the disability.

Accordingly, the assignment of an effective date prior August 23, 2022, for the award of DEA benefits is precluded by law. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 5113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.  Because the law, and not the facts, is dispositive of the outcome of this issue, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

III.  Effective Date for SMC Based on Loss of Use

As noted above, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim or a claim reopened after a final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

The Veteran's effective date for SMC for loss of use of creative organ is based upon his service-connected erectile dysfunction. As such, he clearly cannot receive SMC earlier than the date for which service connection was established for the erectile dysfunction. For the reasons detailed above, the Board has concluded that an effective date earlier than October 27, 2022, is not warranted for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction. Thus, the claim for an earlier effective date for SMC for loss of use of creative organ must be denied.

The Board further notes that the decision in this case is consistent with the recent holding of Delrio, supra, that compensation cannot be paid for a disability, at any evaluation level, before the effective date of service connection for the disability.

Accordingly, the assignment of an effective date prior October 27, 2022, for the award of SMC for loss of use of creative organ is precluded by law. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 5113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.  Because the law, and not the facts, is dispositive of the outcome of this issue, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Sabonis, supra; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

IV.  Effective Date for SMC housebound

As noted above, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim or a claim reopened after a final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application, therefore. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), SMC is payable at the housebound rate where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and, in addition, (1) has a service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

VA has a duty to maximize benefits and should consider any SMC that is raised by the record. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38-39 (1993).  In this case, SMC was raised by the record once the Veteran was evaluated at 100 percent for a single disability and 60 percent for the remaining disabilities. The Veteran met the SMC housebound criteria on the basis of his disability percentage ratings and not on the basis of being permanently housebound.

In this case, the Veteran was assigned a 100 percent disability rating for his service-connected PTSD, effective August 23, 2022.  Effective October 27, 2022, the Veteran has also been awarded service connection for the following disabilities: migraines including migraine variants, rated as 50 percent disabling; tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disabling; and erectile dysfunction, rated as noncompensable.  While the Veteran had a single disability rated at 100 percent effective August 23, 2022, he did not meet the additional 60 percent criteria until October 27, 2022. Thus, October 27, 2022, is the first date the entitlement to SMC housebound arose and therefore the effective date for the SMC housebound evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the Veteran is not entitled to SMC housebound prior to October 27, 2022.

For the reasons explained above, the appropriate effective date for the award of SMC based on housebound criteria is October 27, 2022. The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine in this case; as the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of an effective date prior to October 27, 2022, for the award of SMC based on housebound criteria, the Veteran's claim must be denied.
