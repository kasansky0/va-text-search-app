ORDER       

Entitlement to service connection for left knee osteoarthritis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran had chronic left knee symptoms in service and manifestations of a chronic disease to a degree of 10 percent within a year of separation from service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left knee osteoarthritis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a).

           REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from October 1996 to October 2000. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA has established certain rules and presumptions for chronic diseases, such as arthritis. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). With chronic diseases shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

The Veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence considering the entirety of the record.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021)(en banc).

Service connection for left knee condition 

The Veteran contends that he has a left knee condition that had onset in or is otherwise related to his period of active service. 

Review of the Veteran's service treatment records reflect an entrance musculoskeletal examination within normal limits and no medical concerns regarding knees or the joints on the Report of Medical History. The Veteran was seen in the clinic in April 1998 for complaints of intermittent left knee pain of six months duration which it had worsened over the past week. His knee gave out when he did a deep knee bend to pick up his daughter. Upon examination of the left knee, the clinician observed stable ligaments, no swelling, crepitation, redness, or tibial tenderness. The distal patella was tender. The clinician diagnosed retropatellar pain syndrome, prescribed 800 mgs of Motrin for one week, and provided the Veteran a profile for one week with limitations on running. A separation Report of Medical History and Physical Examination is not available in the claims file. 

VA treatment records include a July 2022 clinic note in which the Veteran was requesting evaluation of his complaint of bilateral knee pain. In November 2022 the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain for nine months and that it was getting harder to walk despite use of braces and naproxen as needed for pain at the 6/7 out of 10 level of intensity. An x-ray showed normal alignment of the knee, no osseous deformity, and mild tricompartmental degenerative joint disease. 

In April 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran indicated that he injured both knees during physical training exercises with wear and tear during road marches and that he has had issues with his knees since active duty. During service he felt the stigma and risk of being labelled a "sick call warrior" if he sought treatment during service. 

In July 2023 the Veteran underwent a VA Knee Conditions examination in which a diagnosis of mild osteoarthritis of the left knee since November 2022 was confirmed. During the examination, the Veteran conveyed that the onset of his condition was 2001-2002 when he gained weight. He first noticed pain under the left kneecap when he pushed up to stand or entered or exited a car. At that time a private physician ordered x-rays and referred him to physical therapy for 15 weeks with no improvement. Over time, the left knee pain has worsened to constant daily aching and sharp pain which worsened with prolonged driving, standing or kneeling, squatting, lunging or any twisting or pivoting motions.  

The examiner concluded after review of the claims file, that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's claimed left knee condition, diagnosed as mild osteoarthritis of the left knee, is proximally due to or the result of the events during service. During service, the Veteran's left knee condition was acute only with treatment for the left knee one date in April 1998. There is no evidence of chronicity of care for a   condition of the left knee from 1998 until July 2022 when the Veteran complained of bilateral knee pain. This leaves a silent gap of 24 years in the medical records for the claimed condition. Without chronicity during service or after service, a   post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology. A nexus had not been established.

After careful analysis, the Board finds that the July 2023 VA medical opinion is based upon an absence of evidence in the treatment records both in and after service. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim); See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that a VA examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the Veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence"). In this instance, the Veteran's service treatment records document six months of left knee pain in service and the Veteran advised the VA examiner of some remote in time knee treatment, in the 2001-2002 time period, which resulted in 15 weeks of physical therapy. Therefore, the examiner's opinion, is based upon an inaccurate factual premises and an absence of documentation both in and after service, which is inadequate for adjudication. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (If the opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise, then it is correct to discount it entirely).

However, the Board has considered whether the Veteran's claim warrants service connection presumptively, based on the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). There is evidence of chronicity in service, with the Veteran reporting to sick call complaining of six months of left knee pain which had worsened. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b). In addition, during his 2023 VA knee examination, he advised that in 2001-2002 he saw a physician who found sufficient symptomology to justify ordering x-rays and a 15-week course of physical therapy. The Veteran's discharge in October 2000 indicates that the majority of 2001 was within a year of the Veteran's discharge from service. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Veteran's left knee condition, given an extended period of left knee symptoms in service and continued symptoms necessitating medical intervention within a short period of time after discharge, meets the criteria of an enumerated chronic disease, left knee arthritis, manifesting to a degree of 10 percent within one year following discharge from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). 

Pursuant to the "benefit-of-the-doubt" rule, where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). For the reasons outlined above, the Board find that the evidence for and against service connection approximates an even balance, and in such instances reasonable doubt must be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Service connection for left knee osteoarthritis is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
