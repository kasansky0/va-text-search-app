REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer of the face, shoulder, arms, and back is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from May 19, 1972 to September 18, 1972 and from August 31, 1975 to September 14, 1975. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for skin cancer of the face, shoulder, arms, and back, most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for skin cancer of the face, shoulder, arms, and back, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer of the face, shoulder, arms, and back is remanded.

The Veteran contends that skin cancer of the face, shoulder, arm, and back is due to service. He asserts that the skin cancer was caused by sun poisoning in 1972 in basic training. Alternatively, he contends he was exposed to herbicide agents when he worked on C123 planes at Rickenbacker.  In January 2023, he submitted an opinion from his private treating provider, Dr. J. C., who opined that the Veteran's skin cancer is caused by in-service exposure to agent orange and dioxins. 

The Veteran served in the Air Force from May 19, 1972 to September 18, 1972 and from August 31, 1975 to September 14, 1975.  The Veteran's personnel records indicate a military occupational specialty (MOS) of Air Cargo Specialist.  His duty station was 76 AP Squadron/Rickenbacker AFB, Ohio. 

Regarding the claimed contact with aircraft that could have been exposed to Agent Orange, effective June 19, 2015, VA amended 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 to establish a presumption of exposure for individuals who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which they had regular and repeated contact (regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard) with C- 123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent (Agent Orange) during the Vietnam era and later develop an Agent Orange presumptive condition. 80 Fed. Reg. 35246 (June 1, 2015) and 83 Fed. Reg. 53179 (Oct. 22, 2018) (interim final rule adopted as final rule) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(v)). See also Institute of Medicine (now Health and Medicine Division or HMD), National Academy of Sciences, Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange Contaminated C-123 Aircraft (2015).

For purposes of this paragraph, "regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C-123 aircraft" means that the individual was assigned to an Air Force or Air Force Reserve squadron when the squadron was permanently assigned one of the affected aircraft and the individual had an Air Force Specialty Code indicating duties as a flight, ground maintenance, or medical crew member on such aircraft. VA has also published a list of military personnel who had regular and repeated exposure to contaminated Operation Ranch Hand C-123s, used to spray Agent Orange in Vietnam, as flight, maintenance, or medical crew members. See VA Public Health Agent Orange webpage http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/docs/AO_C123_AFSpecialityCodesUnits.pdf (last visited April 10, 2025.

According to the report, from 1972 to 1982, approximately 1,500 to 2,100 Air Force Reserve personnel trained and worked on C-123 aircraft that were previously used to spray herbicides, including Agent Orange, in Vietnam. Those aircraft were used for military airlift, medical transport, and cargo transport operations in the United States and internationally. See VA Public Health Agent Orange webpage.

Based on the HMD report, VA has decided to acknowledge exposure to Agent Orange for personnel whose military service involved regular contact with the contaminated C-123 aircraft. This includes individuals who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve who regularly operated, maintained, or served onboard C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray herbicides during the Vietnam era.

The VA Public Health Agent Orange webpage states that the following may qualify for benefits related to Agent Orange exposure:

Active-duty personnel who served in a regular USAF unit location where a contaminated C-123 was assigned who had regular contact with the aircraft through flight, ground, or medical duties between 1969 and 1986, and who developed an Agent Orange related disability.

Reservists who were assigned to flight, ground, or medical crew duties at the following locations between 1969 and 1986, and who developed an Agent Orange related disability. 

The "following locations" include Lockbourne/Rickenbacker Air Force Base in Ohio (906th and 907th Tactical Air Groups or 355th and 356th Tactical Airlift Squadron) is included in this list.

While the Veteran's service personnel record shows he was stationed at Rickenbacker Airforce Base in Ohio, it is unclear to the Board what his duties and responsibilities were as an Air Cargo Specialist.  Specifically, it is unclear whether his duties as an Air Cargo Specialist involved regularly operating, maintaining, or servicing onboard C-123 aircraft known to have been used to spray herbicides during the Vietnam era.  As such, the Board does not have sufficient evidence to conclude he had regular contact with the aircraft through flight, ground, or medical duties between 1969 and 1986.

Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

In this case, the Veteran was stationed at Rickenbacker Airforce Base in Ohio between 1969 to 1986.  He is diagnosed with skin cancer and his private provider has opined that his skin cancer is caused by exposure to Agent Orange in service. 

The M-21 Adjudication Procedures Manual contains guidance for developing claims when the Veteran alleges exposure in a location not associated with a presumption of herbicide exposure. This information is currently found at M21-1, Part VIII.i.1.A.6.a.

On review, there is no indication that VA made attempts to verify the claimed exposure, and under the circumstances of this case, the Board finds the M-21 provisions relevant and instructive. See Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018) (M21-1 is not binding on the Board, and the Board must conduct an independent analysis before determining whether the Manual provisions may be relied upon as a factor to support its decision). 

The AOJ failed to develop the claim and ascertain whether the Veteran was permanently assigned one of the affected aircraft and whether the Veteran had an Air Force Specialty Code indicating duties as a flight, ground maintenance, or medical crew member on such aircraft.

Accordingly, a remand is needed to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify whether the Veteran belonged to 906th and 907th Tactical Air Groups or 355th and 356th Tactical Airlift Squadron when he served at Rickenbacker Air Force Base in Ohio.

Verify whether, as an Air Cargo Specialist at Rickenbacker Air Force Base in Ohio, the Veteran was permanently assigned to one of the affected C-123 aircraft and whether his Air Force Specialty Code indicates duties as a flight, ground maintenance, or medical crew member.

In doing so, follow the steps in the M-21 addressing the verification of herbicide exposure.
