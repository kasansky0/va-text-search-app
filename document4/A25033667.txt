ORDER

An effective date prior to April 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for a total right hip arthropathy is denied.

An effective date prior to April 21, 2023, for the award of service connection for a painful right lower extremity (RLE) scar is denied.

An effective date prior to June 27, 2023, for the award of service connection for a back disorder, to include a lumbosacral strain, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In March 2015, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for multiple right hip disorders, to include limited extension, limited flexion, and limited rotation, abduction, and adduction.  The AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating for his limited flexion and noncompensable ratings for his other right hip disorders.  The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and the March 2015 rating decision became final.

2. In November 2015, the AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating for limited rotation, abduction, and adduction of the right hip, continued the previously assigned noncompensable rating for limited flexion of the right hip, and decreased the rating for limited extension of the right hip from 10 percent to a noncompensable rating.  The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and the November 2015 rating decision became final.

3. In April 2016, the AOJ restyled the Veteran's right hip disorders as a single rating for a total right hip arthropathy and granted a temporary total rating and subsequent increased rating for the disorder.  The Veteran did not appeal, and the April 2016 rating decision became final.

4. It is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's total right hip arthropathy met the criteria for a 70 percent rating prior to April 21, 2023.  

5. A rating decision was issued in June 2023 granting service connection for a painful RLE scar, effective as of April 21, 2023; the Veteran received notice of that decision and his appellate rights later that month.

6. The Veteran filed a NOD with respect to his painful RLE scar on August 10, 2024, more than a year after receiving notice of the June 2023 rating decision.  

7. A showing of good cause has not been made that would warrant an extension of the filing period, and the Board did not waive the timeliness requirement for the VA Form 10182.  

8. Symptoms of a back disorder, to include a lumbosacral strain, were first noted as early as February 1, 2010, his Intent to File was received on June 27, 2023, and there are no documents or communications prior to that date that constitute a formal or informal claim of service connection for a back disorder.    

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The March 2015, November 2015, and April 2016 rating decisions are final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7103, 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2024).  

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to April 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for a total right hip arthropathy have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.157, 3.321, 3.340, 3.400, 3.2500, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5054 (2024).  

3. The August 2024 NOD is untimely with respect to his claim for a painful RLE scar and good cause has not been shown to warrant extending the filing deadline.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 19.2, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203, 20.301 (2024).    

4. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 27, 2023, for the award of service connection for a back disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107, 5110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 3.155, 3.157, 3.340, 3.400 (2024).  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from September 2001 to August 2004 and from October 2009 to January 2010.  His appeal stems from June 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions in which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) awarded a temporary total rating for a service-connected total right hip arthropathy procedure that required convalescence between April 21, 2023, and October 1, 2023, continued a previously assigned 30 percent rating for the disorder as of October 1, 2023, and granted service connection for a painful scar and lumbosacral strain. 

In April 2024, he submitted a request for a Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the two rating decisions in accordance with the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), challenging the ratings assigned for his total right hip arthropathy and lumbosacral strain.  In a July 31, 2024, HLR rating decision, of which the Veteran was notified on August 2, 2024, a Decision Review Officer (DRO) continued the previously assigned rating for his lumbosacral strain but granted an increased rating for his total right hip arthropathy, assigning a 70 percent rating as of October 1, 2023.  In issuing the HLR decision with respect to his total right hip arthropathy, the DRO considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record regarding the Veteran's total right hip arthropathy at the time of the initial June 2023 rating decision.  

Subsequently on August 10, 2024, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a Form 10182.  In so doing, he challenged the effective dates assigned by his AOJ in the June 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions for his painful scar and lumbosacral strain.  Notably, he indicated that he also appealed the June 2023 decision with respect to his total right hip arthropathy.  However, he requested a HLR within one year of the initial June 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, he continuously pursued a claim for his total right hip arthropathy, and the Board will consider his claim as a challenge to the effective date of the 70 percent rating assigned in the August 2, 2024, HLR rating decision.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  

As noted above, the August 2024 HLR rating decision assigned a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's total right hip arthropathy effective as of October 1, 2023.  However, in June 2023 the AOJ assigned a temporary total rating for the disorder for the period from April 21, 2023, to October 1, 2023.  Therefore, his claim for his total right hip arthropathy is moot as to the period from April 21, 2023, to October 1, 2023, and has been restyled as an effective date prior to April 21, 2023, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for his total right hip arthropathy to better reflect the scope of the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 11-12 (2009) (claims should be construed "based on the reasonable expectations of the non-expert... ...claimant and the evidence developed in processing [the claims]"); see also Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009) (applying Clemons to non-psychiatric disorders).   

In his August 2024 Form 10182, the Veteran requested that his claims be reviewed on the Direct Review Docket.  As such, his claims have been considered based on the evidence of record at the time of the rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.  Notably with respect to his claim for a total right hip arthropathy, the Board has not considered evidence during the period after the AOJ issued the initial June 2023 rating decision that was subjected to an HLR.  Rather, it only considered the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.  

Earlier Effective Date for Increased Rating

As a general matter, the effective date of an award based on a claim of increase for compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date for increased rating shall be the earliest date of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for increased rating shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

"Date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  A claim is a "written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a specific benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).   

Generally, an effective date may not be assigned earlier than the date of receipt of the claim for increase.  However, where a veteran claims a non-initial increased rating, an effective date may be awarded up to one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim if the increase in disability was "factually ascertainable" within a one-year period prior to the receipt of the non-initial increased rating claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The purpose of the provision, commonly known as the "one-year lookback period," or simply the "lookback period," is to provide a one-year grace period for filing a claim following any increase in severity of a service-connected disability.  See generally Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Finally, an effective date for increased rating may be assigned later than the date of receipt of the claim, if the evidence shows that the increase in disability actually occurred after the claim was filed but never earlier than the date of receipt of the claim.  

The Veteran has requested an effective date prior to October 1, 2023, for the assignment of a 70 percent rating for his service-connected total right hip arthropathy, arguing that the rating should have been effective as of September 2022.  As detailed above, he received a temporary total rating for the disorder for the period from April 21, 2023, to October 1, 2023.  Therefore, the Board will consider whether an effective date prior to April 21, 2023, is warranted for the assignment of the 70 percent rating.

Procedurally, the Veteran initiated an online claim in eBenefits on April 26, 2013, and subsequently filed a claim of service connection for a right hip disorder on March 3, 2014.  In March 2015, the AOJ granted service connection for limited extension, limited flexion, and limited rotation, abduction and adduction of the right hip, assigning a 10 percent rating for his limited flexion and noncompensable ratings for the additional conditions.  The Veteran did not appeal the March 2015 rating decision; as such, it is final and cannot serve as the basis for an earlier effective date.  

Next, he submitted a claim for increased ratings for his service-connected right hip conditions in August 2015.  In November 2015, the AOJ granted a 10 percent for the limited rotation, abduction, and adduction of his right hip, continued a noncompensable rating for his service-connected limited flexion of his right hip, and decreased the rating assigned for his service-connected limited extension of the right hip from 10 percent to a noncompensable rating.  

On March 24, 2016, the Veteran submitted a new increased rating claim for his service-connected right hip.  In April 2016, the AOJ determined that his right hip conditions progressed, restyled the conditions as a single rating for total right hip arthropathy, and granted a temporary total rating and subsequent increased rating for the disorder.  To this end, the AOJ awarded a total rating for the period between April 4, 2016, and May 31, 2017, and otherwise increased the rating from 10 percent to 30 percent for the period beginning on June 1, 2017.  He did not appeal the November 2015 and April 2016 rating decisions; as such, they are also final and cannot serve as the basis for an earlier effective date.

More recently, on September 1, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966 indicating his intent to file a claim for compensation.  Subsequently in May 2023, he filed a new increased rating claim for his right hip disorder, to include entitlement to a temporary total rating based on convalescence.  In June 2023, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim for a temporary total rating based on convalescence from April 21, 2023, to October 1, 2023, and continued the previously assigned 30 percent rating for his right hip disorder for the period since October 1, 2023.  

In April 2024, within a year of the June 2023 rating decision, the Veteran requested a HLR of the June 2023 rating decision, asserting that his right hip disorder warranted a higher rating.  In a July 2024 decision of which the Veteran received notice on August 2, 2024, the AOJ awarded a 70 percent rating for his total right hip arthropathy, effective as of October 1, 2023- the first day following his period of convalescence.  

He subsequently appealed the decision, indicating that he was not satisfied with the effective date assigned for the 70 percent rating.  He first submitted the claim currently on appeal for a non-initial rating on September 1, 2022, and continuously pursued it since that time.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Moreover, the claim has not become final.  Therefore, the one-year "lookback period" applies, and the Board will consider whether the Veteran's right hip disorder met the criteria for a 70 percent rating for the period between September 1, 2021, and April 21, 2023.

In order to assign an effective date prior to the date of receipt of the claim on appeal, it must be factually ascertainable that the increase in the disability at issue occurred during the "lookback period."  Therefore, the threshold question is whether it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran met the criteria for a 70 percent rating between September 1, 2021, and April 21, 2023.  

Under the relevant laws and regulations, a 70 percent rating is warranted for residuals of a total arthroplasty of the hip that include markedly severe residual weakness, pain, or limitation of motion following implantation of prosthesis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5054.

Importantly, the term "markedly severe" is not defined in the Rating Schedule and the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has provided no guidance.  Therefore, rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions will be "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue.  Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding any request for an increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.  

When a term is not defined in a statute or regulation, it is given its ordinary meaning.  Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citing Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).  To this end, the Court regularly turns to the dictionary to determine the "ordinary meaning" of a term.  Here, "markedly" is defined as having a distinctive or emphasized character.  Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (internal citation omitted).  "Severe" is defined as "requiring great effort" or "of a great degree."  Id.  Therefore, the Board finds that to be "markedly severe," the symptoms at issue must be demonstrably severe and significantly impair the Veteran's ability to functionally use his hip (such as a profound impairment in his ability to walk or stand).

Turning to the evidence, the record indicates demonstrably severe hip pain throughout the period on appeal.  To this end, the Veteran reported hip pain in multiple medical treatment notes between December 2022 and April 2023.  Additionally, in an April 2023 operative report, he recounted that he had an initial arthroplasty in April 2016 and did well until April 2022, at which time he suffered a hip injury playing football and developed severe pain.

However, the medical records do not show that his total right hip arthropathy resulted in significant impairment in functionality prior to April 21, 2023.  In this regard, December 2022 and January 2023 treatment notes indicated that the Veteran worked from home as a recruiter and enjoyed activities including spending time with his daughter, walking, and playing softball.  Moreover, he reported in January 2023 that he intended to coach his daughter's soccer team.

Based on the above, it is not factually ascertainable that the criteria for a 70 percent rating were met prior to April 21, 2023.  In this regard, treatment notes throughout the period on appeal established demonstrably severe right hip pain.  However, they did not document that the pain resulted in impaired functionality; rather, the Veteran reported throughout the period on appeal that he worked as a recruiter, spent time with his daughter, walked, played softball, and was planning on coaching his daughter's soccer team.  In sum, the overall disability picture did not establish that the Veteran's total right hip arthroplasty met the criteria for a 70 percent rating prior to April 21, 2023.  Therefore, October 1, 2023, is appropriately assigned as the effective date for the 70 percent rating for the Veteran's total right hip arthropathy, and an earlier effective date for the rating is denied.    

Earlier Effective Date for Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, unless specifically provided otherwise in the statute, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for compensation benefits shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(h)(2).  

The effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be the date following separation from service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation, otherwise the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Under the laws and regulations currently in effect, a claim must be filed on the form prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under laws administered by VA.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  

However, prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" included formal and informal communications in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2010).  Under the relevant laws and regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA could have constituted an informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2010).  The essential elements were: (1) an intent to apply for the benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing.  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2010) (noting that an informal claim had to identify the benefit sought).  

Finally, the Court has held that once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate a freestanding earlier effective date claim in an attempt to overcome the finality of a prior rating decision.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  The court reasoned that such claims would vitiate the rule of finality.  However, decisions are subject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  If evidence establishes the error, the prior decision shall be reversed or revised.  38 U.S.C. § 7111.    

Painful RLE Scar

In addition to the above, claimants may appeal a decision by the AOJ by submitting a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  To this end, claimants must file a properly completed NOD within one year of the date on which the agency mails notice of the rating decision at issue.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  Claimants may request an extension of the period to file or modify a NOD by submitting the request in writing to the Board.  Such an extension may be granted for good cause.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).  

Here, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File in September 2022 and a claim in May 2023 for a temporary total rating for a total right hip arthropathy requiring convalescence and an increased rating for the disorder for the period following his convalescence.  In a June 23, 2023, rating decision, of which notification was mailed on June 26, 2023, the AOJ granted a separate 10 percent rating for a painful scar, effective as of April 21, 2023.  Subsequently in his August 2024 Form 10182, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the effective date assigned for his service-connected painful RLE scar. 

Here, the Veteran's appeal was submitted more than one year after the issuance of the June 2023 rating decision.  Moreover, he has not requested or otherwise provided good cause to support extending the filing deadline.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).  Therefore, the Veteran's August 2024 NOD was not timely with respect to the June 2023 rating decision on his claim for a painful RLE scar.  

Finally, the Board has considered whether it waived its right to enforce the filing deadline by virtue of docketing the appeal.  See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37 (2009) (holding that VA waived any objection to the timeliness of a substantive legacy appeal because it consistently treated the matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal for over five years).  

Here, the Veteran filed his appeal via a VA Form 10182 on August 10, 2024.  Later that month on August 16, 2024, the Board sent the Veteran a letter acknowledging receipt of the Form 10182 and notifying him that it placed his appeal on the Direct Review Docket.  The Board finds that this latter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of docketing the attempted appeal does not in and of itself constitute a waiver of timeliness.

Rather, whether the Board has waived any objection to the timeliness of a VA Form 10182 is based on all the facts and circumstances of that case.  Here, although the appeal was docketed as an automatic administrative action, the Board did not continuously engage in substantive and procedural development of the appeal.  To date, there is no action in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the claim for his RLE scar were examined and being developed in any substantive way.  Indeed, on August 28, 2024- almost two weeks after the Board sent its notification of receipt and docketing of the appeal- the Veteran, through his representative, submitted a brief characterizing the disabilities on appeal as a lumbosacral strain and total right hip arthropathy.  

The Board's notice of receipt of the Veteran's purposed appeal did not convey any intent to forego reliance on the laws applicable to docketing.  Thus, the docketing of the appeal, with no further action in developing the claim, does not constitute a waiver of the timeliness requirement for VA Form 10182s.  As such, an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a RLE scar is denied and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.  

Back Disorder

The Veteran contends that an effective date of September 2022 is warranted for his back disorder, to include a lumbosacral strain.  In the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ assigned an effective date of June 27, 2023- the date of receipt of an Intent to File a claim for compensation- for the claim on appeal.  Accordingly, the question is whether an earlier effective date is warranted.

Turning first to an effective date based on the day following separation from service, the Veteran ultimately separated from active service in January 2010 and did not submit his claim until years later.  As such, he is not entitled to an effective date within one year of discharge from service.

As to the date entitlement arose for his back disorder, a November 2023 VA medical opinion observed that Veteran complained of back pain in September 2009, May 2010, and June 2010 service treatment records (STRs).  The examiner opined that the Veteran's then-current back disorder stemmed from his in-service back pain.  Therefore, February 1, 2010- the day after his ultimate separation from active service- is the date entitlement arose.

As to the date of claim, the record shows that the Veteran submitted an Intent to File a claim for compensation on June 27, 2023.  Subsequently on August 3, 2023, he submitted a claim of service connection for a back disorder.  In December 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's back disorder and assigned an effective date of June 27, 2023- the date on which VA received the Veteran's Intent to File form.

The Veteran has argued that an effective date of September 2022 is warranted for the award of service connection for his back disorder.  A review of the record reveals that the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0966 indicating his Intent to File a claim for compensation on September 1, 2022.  Under the relevant regulations, veterans may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  If VA receives a complete claim on the proper form prescribed by the Secretary within 1 year of its receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received.  Id. 

Importantly, only one complete claim for a benefit (i.e. compensation or pension) may be associated with each Intent to File.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(ii).  Where multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an Intent to File, only the first claim will be associated with the Intent to File.  Id.  Therefore, in order for the Veteran's back disorder to warrant an effective date of September 2022, the threshold question is whether any other claims were filed in between the September 1, 2022, Intent to File and August 3, 2023, service connection claim.  

Here, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim on May 10, 2023- almost three months prior to the claim for his back disorder.  Therefore, the August 3, 2023, claim for a back disorder does not correspond with the September 1, 2022, Intent to File and an effective date of September 2022 is not warranted.  Rather, no communication or other evidence in the record may be reasonably construed as a claim or an intent to file a claim for a back disorder prior to the June 27, 2023, Intent to File form.  Therefore, June 27, 2023- the date of receipt of his VA Form 21-0966- is the date of the claim on appeal.

Effective dates are assigned based on the date of claim (June 27, 2023) or the date entitlement arose (February 1, 2010), whichever is later.  As the June 27, 2023, claim is later than the date on which entitlement arose, the effective date for the grant of service connection for a back disorder has been properly established as June 27, 2023, the appeal is denied to this extent, and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
