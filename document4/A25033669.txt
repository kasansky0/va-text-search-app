ORDER

Challenges to the rate of recoupment of an overpayment debt are dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to promulgation of a decision by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), the Veteran filed a signed correspondence dated September 10, 2024, withdrawing her appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of challenges to the rate of recoupment of the overpayment debt have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from June 1998 to December 2004. This matter comes before the Board on her appeal related to the rate of recoupment of Veteran's overpayment debt.  However, the Veteran's September 10, 2024, written submission stated that she was withdrawing both her request for a Board hearing and her appeal.  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. An appeal may be withdrawn at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b). Withdrawal may be made by a veteran or his/her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (a). 

Here, the Veteran clearly indicated that she wished to withdraw this appeal. Further, the Veteran's withdrawal application is duly signed and dated. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's September 10, 2024, application withdrawing her appeal is explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such an action on the part of the Veteran. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011). Since there remains no allegation of errors of fact/law for appellate consideration, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the Veteran's appeal.  Accordingly, her appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In addition, the matters associated with the rate of recoupment of overpayment debts fall outside the Board's subject matter jurisdiction since a rate of recoupment is legally a compromise between the debtor and the Department of Veterans Affairs. VAOPGCPREC 4-2003 (Aug. 28, 2003).
