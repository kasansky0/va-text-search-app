ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of a creative organ is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected scrotal varicocele and atrophy of both testes results in the loss of use of a creative organ. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(k), 5701; 38 C.F.R. §§3.102, 3.350(a)(1)(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 2002 to September 2006.  In September 2024, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket when he appealed a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  

Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after the December 2023 rating decision the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

SMC

Entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ is granted.

In this case, a September 2023 Board decision granted service connection for scrotal varicocele and atrophy of both testes.  Thereafter, in a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's grant of service connection for scrotum varicocele and atrophy of both testes and assigned a 20 percent rating from March 21, 2018.  The Veteran, through his attorney, asserts that this disability results in loss of use of a creative organ and allows for an award of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ.  The Board agrees.

SMC based upon loss of use of a creative organ is warranted if a veteran has acquired absence of one or both testicles (other than undescended testicles) or ovaries or other creative organ.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(1)(i).  Loss of use of one testicle will be established when examination by a board finds that: (a) the diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-third of the corresponding diameters of the paired normal testicle; or (b) the diameters of the affected testicle are reduced to one-half or less of the corresponding normal testicle and there is alteration of consistency so that the affected testicle is considerably harder or softer than the corresponding normal testicle; or (c) if neither of the conditions (a) or (b) is met, when a biopsy, recommended by a board including a genito urologist and accepted by the veteran, establishes the absence of spermatozoa.  Id.

Here, the competent evidence of record demonstrates both the Veteran's testicles measure between one half and one third of their normal size. See May 2018 private disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) (indicating both testes to be abnormal and noting their size was between one half and one third of their normal size).  In this regard, the Board notes that the November 2023 VA examiner did not examine the Veteran's testes, stating that "a testicular exam is not relevant to the condition."  

Thus, as the only competent evidence of record is in favor of the claim, the Board finds that the criteria for special monthly compensation based on the loss of use of a creative organ are met.
