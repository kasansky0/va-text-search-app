REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1971 to April 1979.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a December 2022 decision. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2022 decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that the Board could not in consider in this decision, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim. Notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing was not provided in this case prior to AOJ's adjudication in February 2024.  In Bowen, however, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket in the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) that he signed. The Veteran selected Direct Docket review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because he was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  

Increased Ratings and Effective Dates

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the Veteran's symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. Id. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. "Staged ratings" are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a). An exception to that rule applies under circumstances where evidence demonstrates a factually ascertainable increase in disability during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (3). In that situation, the law provides that the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. Id.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

For an increased rating claim, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of a case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)). Harper, 10 Vet. App. at 126.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic)

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (sciatic)

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (femoral)

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy, right lower extremity (femoral)

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild, moderate, moderately severe," and "severe." See Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018) ("DC 8520 does not define 'mild,' 'moderate,' 'moderately severe,' or 'severe,' or generally associate those terms with specific symptoms."). Although the Board has at times attempted to define these terms using dictionary definitions, those definitions are problematic because they "do little to explain the Board's understanding of these terms and do not 'disclos[e] that benchmark it employed to reach [its] conclusion.' "See Casey v. McDonough, No. 21-7569, slip op. at 3 (Vet. App. Jan. 24, 2023) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (quoting Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018) (discussing the Board's attempt to define the terms slight, mild, moderate, and severe in Diagnostic Code 8515).

The VA Adjudicative Procedures Manual M21-1 (hereinafter M21-1) contains provisions regarding rating peripheral nerve disabilities. The Federal Circuit held that the Board is not bound by the provisions of the M21-1, and the manual does not "carry the force of law." See DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affs., 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

Nevertheless, the Court in Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018), held that the Board is required to discuss "any relevant provisions contained in the [M21] as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases, but because it is not bound by those provisions, it must make its own determination before it chooses to rely on an [M21] provision as a factor to support its decision." In Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021), the Court elaborated that, in the context of relevant guidance documents, the Board can "neither merely invoke nor ignore a relevant guidance provision to support its decision but must provide an independent rationale relating its decision to the relevant guidance document." Pursuant to Wilson, the Board finds that the M21-1, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section A.2.c provides "general guidelines" for the terms "mild," "moderate," moderately severe," and "severe" in the context of evaluating incomplete paralysis of peripheral nerves.

"Mild" is described as the lowest level of evaluation based on the symptoms, however, slight, if they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment. Generally, "mild" is limited to a disability of sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, and affecting a small area and/or a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality.

"Moderate" is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment. The M21-1 further elaborates that the following "sign/symptom combinations" may fall into the moderate category: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

"Moderately severe" is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve and is described as motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Atrophy may be present with moderately severe peripheral neuropathy.

"Severe," in general, is expected to include motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen with severe longstanding neuropathy. Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs / symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.

The term "incomplete paralysis" with this and other peripheral nerve injuries indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement [of impaired nerve function] is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves.

The term "incomplete paralysis" with this and other peripheral nerve injuries indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement [of impaired nerve function] is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves.

Neuritis, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123 

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. Tic douloureux, or trifacial neuralgia, may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

Service connection for radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities, sciatic, was granted in an October 2020 rating decision.  An initial 10 percent rating was assigned for each lower extremity from July 29, 2020.

In April 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), seeking, inter alia, compensation for right lower extremity radiculopathy and left lower extremity radiculopathy.  

In a July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy, femoral, and assigned initial 10 percent ratings for each lower extremity from April 16, 2021.  The AOJ also continued the 10 percent ratings for each lower extremity based on sciatic radiculopathy.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim on September 30, 2021, seeking a higher initial ratings and earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection. The AOJ adjudicated those claims in a January 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application For Increased Compensation Based On Unemployability on September 1, 2022, which the AOJ interpreted as an increased rating claim.

In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted 20 percent ratings for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy for both the sciatic and femoral nerves; each of the awards was effective from September 1, 2022. In an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, the Veteran requested earlier effective dates for the grants of the 20 percent ratings.

The AOJ denied earlier effective dates for the 20 percent ratings in the February 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal. 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. (Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720.). Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a.

Paralysis of the anterior crural nerve (femoral) is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent disabling. Complete, with the paralysis of quadriceps extensor muscles, is rated as 40 percent disabling. Id. 

The Veteran's attorney contends that the Veteran is entitled to 20 percent ratings for each of the left and right lower extremity neuropathies from July 29, 2020, as he has continuously pursued the claims since the initial claim.

Evidence

A VA examination in October 2020 noted positive straight leg raising test bilaterally.  Reflexes were 2+ in both ankles and 1+ in both knees.  The examiner noted mild constant pain; mild intermittent pain; mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and mild numbness, bilaterally.  The examiner noted involvement of the sciatic nerves bilaterally; no involvement of either femoral nerve was indicated.  The examiner noted that the severity of the Veteran's bilateral neuropathy was mild.  

On VA examination conducted May 14, 2021, the examiner noted 5/5 muscle strength bilaterally.  There was no muscle atrophy.  Reflexes were 2+ in the knees and ankles.  The examiner noted no constant pain; severe intermittent pain; moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and mild numbness, bilaterally.  The examiner noted involvement of the sciatic and femoral nerves bilaterally.    

The VA examination in September 2022 showed muscle strength testing as follows:  hip flexion and knee extension, 3/5 bilaterally; ankle plantar flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and great toe extension, 4/5 bilaterally.  Reflexes were 1+ in the knees and ankles.  Straight leg raising test was positive bilaterally.  The examiner noted moderate constant pain; no intermittent pain; moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and moderate numbness, bilaterally.  The examiner noted involvement of the sciatic and femoral nerves bilaterally.    

Analysis

The Board finds that the criteria for a 20 percent rating for the left and right lower extremity sciatic nerve and femoral nerve radiculopathies were not met prior to September 1, 2022.  

For the sciatic nerve radiculopathy, the October 2020 examiner characterized the radiculopathy as mild bilaterally.  No more than mild symptoms were noted on that examination. The examiner's assessment, which was based on the clinical record, is probative.  The May 2021 examination noted normal muscle strength and reflexes bilaterally, with no muscle atrophy.  While the examiner noted severe intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness, these symptoms were not shown to result in a disability picture consistent with a finding of moderate incomplete paralysis. Sign/symptoms combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate were not shown.

For the femoral nerve radiculopathy, no femoral nerves findings were noted on the October 2020 examination.  The May 2021 examiner noted normal muscle strength and reflexes bilaterally, with no muscle atrophy.  While the examiner noted severe intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness, these symptoms were not shown to result in a disability picture consistent with a finding of moderate incomplete paralysis. Sign/symptoms combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate were not shown.

The first evidence of moderate incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic and femoral nerves was on the September 2022 VA examination.  Thus, there was no basis for a 20 percent rating for either lower extremity based on moderate incomplete paralysis of the left or right sciatic or femoral nerve prior to the September 2022 examination.  

Accordingly, an earlier effective date for the awards of 20 percent ratings for left and right sciatic nerve radiculopathy and left and right femoral nerve radiculopathy is not warranted.

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for a 10 percent rating for painful scar mid/lower back status post discectomy of L2/L3

A July 2021 rating decision granted service connection for scar, status post discectomy of L2/L3.  An initial noncompensable rating was assigned from April 16, 2021.  

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application For Increased Compensation Based On Unemployability on September 1, 2022.

In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for painful scar mid/lower back status point discectomy of L2/L3.  A 10 percent rating was assigned from September 1, 2022.

In an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, the Veteran requested an earlier effective date for the grant of the 10 percent rating. The AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the 10 percent rating in the February 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal. 

The Veteran's painful scar of the lower back is currently assigned a 10 percent rating from September 1, 2022, under Diagnostic Code 7804. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Diagnostic Code 7804 is for unstable or painful scars. The code provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; a 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; and a 30 percent rating for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Code 7804, Note (1). If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, 10 percent is added to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (2).

Diagnostic Code 7805 directs that disabling effects not considered in a rating provide under Codes 7800 through 7804 be rated under another appropriate Code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.

Diagnostic Code 7801 provides ratings for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. A 10 percent rating is assigned for an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters) but less than 12 square inches (77 square centimeters). A 20 percent rating is assigned for an area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 square centimeters) but less than 72 square inches (465 square centimeters).

Evidence

A VA scars examination in May 2021 noted a post-surgical discectomy scar of the back.  The Veteran did not report any symptoms associated with the scar.  The examiner stated that the scar was not painful or unstable.  The examiner noted the scar of the lumbar area measured 3.0 by 0.2 centimeters.  There was no underlying tissue damage associated with the scar.  The scar caused no functional impact.

VA scars examination in September 2022 noted that the Veteran reported that his lumbar scar was dull and achy.  The examiner stated that there was one scar that was painful but not unstable.  The examiner noted the scar of the lumbar area measured 3.0 by 0.5 centimeters and was tender to palpation.  The scar caused no functional impact.

Analysis

The Board finds that an effective date prior to September 1, 2022 for the award of a 10 percent rating for painful scar of the mid/lower back status point discectomy of L2/L3 is not warranted.

The current appeal arises from the Veteran's September 1, 2022, TDIU claim, which makes no specific mention of the Veteran's scar.  The AOJ granted the 10 percent rating effective September 1, 2022. The period on appeal extends to one year prior to the date of this claim, however, a review of the evidentiary record does not show that a painful scar was present prior to the assigned effective date of September 1, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

The first evidence of a painful scar was on the September 2022 VA scars examination.  The earlier May 2021 scars examination specifically found no painful scar.  There is no lay statement from the Veteran or his representative asserting that his scar was painful prior to the September 2022 VA examination. Thus, there was no basis for a 10 percent rating based on painful scar prior to the September 2022 examination.  

Accordingly, an earlier effective date (considering a one-year look back), for the award of a 10 percent rating for painful scar mid/lower back status point discectomy of L2/L3 is not warranted.
