REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial disability rating higher than 10 percent for the Veteran's ulcerative colitis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from November 2014 to June 2015, with additional reserve service in the National Guard.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the July 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal.  In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's increased rating claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The issue of entitlement to an increased rating for the Veteran's ulcerative colitis disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2024 AOJ rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained VA examinations for the Veteran's ulcerative colitis disability in April 2023 and May 2023, before the rating decision on appeal.  At the examinations, the VA examiner acknowledged that the Veteran took medication for his disability.  However, the examiner did not describe what the Veteran's disability would look like without the impact of his medication.  See Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327.  For part of the appeal period, the rating criteria set forth in Diagnostic Code 7323 for ulcerative colitis did not consider medication. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2023).  Effective May 19, 2024, the Diagnostic Code for ulcerative colitis was amended.  The rater is now instructed to evaluate ulcerative colitis as Crohn's disease or undifferentiated form of inflammatory bowel disease under Diagnostic Code 7326.  The rating criteria in Diagnostic Code 7326 contemplate medication.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2024).  However, for the portion of the appeal period prior to May 19, 2024, the rating criteria do not contemplate the impact of medication.   Accordingly, a remand for a new VA opinion is needed. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran's claims to the examiner who conducted the May 2023 VA examination so a supplemental opinion may be provided for his ulcerative colitis.  The entire claims file and a copy of this remand must be made available to the examiner for review.

The VA examiner should describe the severity of the Veteran's ulcerative colitis disability without consideration of any ameliorative impact of medication taken for ulcerative colitis. 

The examiner must provide all findings, along with a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion.
