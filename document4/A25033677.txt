ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date before March 24, 2020, for service connection of sleep apnea with asthma is granted.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for sleep apnea with asthma is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran had symptoms of sleep apnea with asthma amounting to functional impairment at the time of the August 29, 2018, Intent to File a claim for a respiratory condition, and as such, this is the effective date.

2. Since August 29, 2018, the Veteran required the use of a CPAP machine for his sleep apnea with asthma.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date before March 24, 2020, for service connection of sleep apnea with asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for sleep apnea with asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602-6847.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service in the United States Army from September 1994 to July 2004 and from May 2009 to June 2010.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in August 2023 and April 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In August 2023 and March 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Forms 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2022 and a December 2022 decision.  In August 2023 and April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decisions on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2022 and December 2022 decisions.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 and December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date before March 24, 2020, for service connection of sleep apnea with asthma

The Veteran contends that his August 2018 Intent to File a claim, which he later filed as respiratory condition which includes asthma, encompassed a claim for sleep apnea. See August 2024 IHP.

Earlier Effective Dates

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. Exceptions to this rule include a later grant of service connection based in whole or in part on newly obtained service department records under certain circumstances, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c), and when the decision is revised or reversed because of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as provided in 38 U.S.C. § 5109A (a) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a).

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). An informal claim must identify the benefits sought; and upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim. Id. 

Although a claimant need not identify the benefit sought "with specificity," see Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199-200 (1992), some intent on the part of the Veteran to seek benefits must be demonstrated. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). See also Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-7 (1995) (noting that while VA must interpret a claimant's submissions broadly, VA is not required to conjure up issues not raised by claimant). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized VA has a duty to fully and sympathetically develop a Veteran's claim to its optimum. Hodge v. West, 155 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This duty requires VA to "determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations," Roberson v. West, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and extends to giving a sympathetic reading to all pro se pleadings of record. Szemraj v. Principi, 357 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). The effective date of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but rather, on the date the application was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

In general, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a finally adjudicated claim, VA shall reopen and review the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision makers.  Relevant evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.

When all the evidence is assembled, the Secretary is then responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The Veteran was granted service connection for sleep apnea with asthma effective March 24, 2020. For the reasons below, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 29, 2018, is warranted for the service connection of sleep apnea.

As explained above, the applicable law provides that the effective date is the date entitlement arose, or the date of the claim, whichever is later.

On August 29, 2018, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File. On the same day, he filed a new claim for a respiratory condition which includes asthma. See August 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Turning to the medical evidence on file, the record shows that on June 21, 2017, the Veteran complained of bronchitis since the military, having a hard time breathing, mucus in the nose and throat, and reported using inhalers in his mid-20s. See 2017 VA Treatment Records.

In November 2017, the Veteran presented for a pulmonary evaluation in which the physician indicated that a sleep study was needed with concern for sleep apnea. See November 2017 Private Treatment Record.

In September 2018, the Veteran underwent a home sleep study, pursuant to which he was diagnosed with sleep apnea and prescribed a CPAP machine. See September 2018 VA Treatment Records.

The Board thus finds that entitlement arose at least as early as 2017, when the Veteran presented with complaints of breathing problems. In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit found that the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability. Here, even though the Veteran's sleep apnea was not officially diagnosed until September 2018, the symptoms that led to this diagnosis are ascertainable at least as early as June 2017.

As the date of the claim is later than the date entitlement arose, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of August 29, 2018, is warranted for the service connection of sleep apnea and grants this appeal.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for sleep apnea with asthma

The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea with asthma should be initially rated as 50 percent disabling. See August 2024 IHP.

Disability ratings are based on average impairment in earning capacity resulting from a particular disability and are determined by comparing symptoms shown with criteria in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings apply, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. An exception to this rule occurs when the rating criteria are successive. In such a case, all the requirements of the lower levels must be met before a higher level is awarded, so 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 do not apply. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. It is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts in each case, with all reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant; however, the reasonable doubt rule is not a means for reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

With a claim for an increased initial rating, separate staged ratings may be assigned based on facts found. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). In a claim for increase in a previously established rating, the present level of disability is the primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, staged ratings are to be considered. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).

The Veteran's statements describing symptoms and condition are competent evidence to the extent that one can describe one's own experiences. However, these statements must be viewed in conjunction with the medical evidence and the pertinent rating criteria. Lay evidence is not competent evidence concerning complex medical questions requiring specialized training or expertise. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Whether lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a fact issue to be addressed by the Board rather than a legal issue to be addressed by the Veterans' Court.).

The Veteran's sleep apnea with asthma is rated under DC 6602-6847. See April 2024 Codesheet. Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27.

Under DC 6602, a 30 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. A 100 percent rating is assigned for bronchial asthma with an FEV-1 of less than 40-percent predicted; or FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or more than 1 attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or requires daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

The Board notes that PFTs are required to rate respiratory conditions except in certain situations, such as when the PFTs are inconsistent with the other clinical evidence of record and the examiner states why they are not a valid indication of respiratory functional impairment in a particular case. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(3). Further, post-bronchodilator PFT studies should be used except when the results of pre-bronchodilator tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(4).

When evaluating a disability based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results should be used unless such results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results, in which case the latter should be applied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5). When there is a disparity between the results of different PFTs (FEV-1, FVC, etc.) so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, use the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflects the level of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5).

Under 6847, a 50 percent rating is warranted for the use of breathing assistance device such as a CPAP machine; a 100 percent rating is warranted for chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or requires tracheostomy. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6847.

Upon review of the totality of the record, the Board finds that the sleep apnea with asthma is appropriately rated under DC 6847 for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA); however, a rating more than 50 percent is not warranted.

Medical records related to the Veteran's sleep apnea from September 2018 indicate that the Veteran was prescribed a CPAP machine. See September 2018 VA Treatment Records. There was no evidence of chronic respiratory failure, carbon dioxide retention, cor pulmonale, or requirement for tracheostomy.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for asthma in December 2020, wherein he reported shortness of breath on exertion after walking one flight of stairs. See December 2020 VA Examination. The Veteran denied hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and steroid usage. He did not use oral or inhaled medication, a bronchodilator, antibiotics, or oxygen therapy. He reported no asthma attacks in the previous 12 months. No PFT results were available, as the Veteran did not report to his scheduled PFT.

In June 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for sleep apnea, which was officially diagnosed in September 2018. See June 2021 VA Examination. His only reported symptom was peristent daytime somnolence, and he required the use of a CPAP. 

In an October 2022 VA examination for sleep apnea, the Veteran reported progression of his sleep apnea. See October 2022 VA Examination. He reported difficulty falling and staying asleep due to snoring, as well as daytime drowsiness. He reported having a CPAP since 2018.

The Veteran submitted a statement in October 2023 corroborating his symptoms found in the treatment records discussed above. See October 2023 Lay Statement. In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of his symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination for sleep apnea in December 2023, and the same findings of persistent daytime hypersomnolence and necessity for a CPAP were made. See December 2023 VA Examination. He reported no surgeries or medication.

Based on a review of the relevant evidence, the Board finds that a higher rating for OSA with asthma is not warranted. While the relevant evidence of record indicates that the Veteran meets the criteria contemplated by the 50 percent rating criteria under DC 6847, as he requires the use of a breathing assistance device such as a CPAP machine, there is nothing in the relevant evidence to suggest that the Veteran has chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or that he requires a tracheostomy to warrant a higher, 100 percent rating under DC 6847. There were no PFT readings to review and assign a compensable rating under DC 6602. Further, the Veteran reported that he did not use medication, nor did he have any asthma attacks in the previous 12 months. A 60 percent rating under DC 6602 requires at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.

The hyphenated diagnostic code here indicates that the Veteran is rated for asthma under DC 6602 and then DC 6847 for OSA.

Specifically, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (a), ratings under DCs 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 (which encompasses both asthma and OSA) will not be combined with each other. Where there is lung or pleural involvement, ratings under DCs 6819 and 6820 will not be combined with each other or with DCs 6600 through 6817 or 6822 through 6847. A single rating will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96. This has been interpreted to mean that VA will evaluate coexisting service-connected respiratory conditions covered by § 4.96(a) under the criteria enumerated in the predominant disability's DC. See Urban, 29 Vet. App. at 95.

In the March 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. At that time, the asthma was combined with sleep apnea, and he was assigned a single 50 percent rating for both disabilities pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 under DC 6847. The AOJ determined that OSA was the predominant disability as there was no evidence indicating asthma was more severe than the 50 percent rating.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (a), when service connection was granted for asthma, the Veteran was not legally entitled to separate compensable ratings for the asthma and OSA. Therefore, when asthma and OSA were combined pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.96, and the Veteran was assigned a 50 percent rating pursuant to DC 6847 pertaining to OSA, the Veteran was afforded the higher of the two potential ratings allowable for the asthma and OSA disabilities based on the predominant disability. Therefore, the Veteran was afforded the greater benefit.

(Continued on next page.)

In conclusion, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an initial 50 percent disability rating for sleep apnea with asthma from August 29, 2018.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
