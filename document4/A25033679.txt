ORDER

The appeal of the "denial of back claims" is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On June 15, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in which he requested review of "denial of back claims."  This VA Form 10182 was received over one year after the issuance of a February 2021 notification letter for a rating decision addressing the Veteran's back disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the "denial of back claims" have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 1990 to May 1991 and from January 1996 to June 1997.

On June 15, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in which he requested review of the "denial of back claims" and identified three areas of disagreement: service connection, effective date, and disability evaluation.  

The question in this case is whether the June 2023 Notice of Disagreement is timely. For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the June 2023 Notice of Disagreement is not timely and therefore, the appeal must be dismissed.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (a)(1)(ii) and 20.202, a Veteran may appeal a rating decision to the Board on the form prescribed by the Secretary (a VA Form 10182 Decision Review request: Board Appeal (NOD)) within one year after the date of the mailing of the letter notifying the Veteran of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (a)(1)(ii), 20.202. 

A claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.  Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

Where mandatory claims processing rules are not followed without good cause shown, including the untimely submission of an NOD, dismissal of the claim is warranted. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 330 (2021) (the Board may dismiss nonconforming filings in appropriate circumstances); see also Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 269-272 (2024) (en banc); 38 U.S.C. §7105 (d)(3). 

In this case, an October 1997 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for lumbar strain.  Thus, the first area of disagreement listed in the June 2023 NOD has already been resolved in the Veteran's favor and no further relief is warranted in that regard.

The remaining two areas of disagreement were most recently addressed in a February 2021 rating decision, which found clear and unmistakable errors and reestablished: (1) the previously assigned evaluation of 40 percent for status post lumbar spinal fusion with residual hardware, effective December 1, 2010, (2) the previously assigned 20 percent evaluation for sciatic nerve radiculopathy, lower left extremity, effective November 8, 2010, and (3) the previously assigned 20 percent evaluation for sciatic nerve radiculopathy, right lower extremity, effective November 8, 2010.  

The AOJ notified the Veteran of the February 2021 rating decision by a notification letter dated February 9, 2021.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted the June 2023 VA Form 10182.  This VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement is not timely because it was received over one year after the February 9, 2021, notification letter.

In determining whether it can address the "back claims" on the merits, the Board notes that, "[a]lthough VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings in appropriate circumstances, none of this affects the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals of veterans benefits decisions." Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 330 (2021). The Board thus has jurisdiction over this claim but can dismiss the appeal based on the failure to timely file an NOD. This could constitute an "appropriate circumstance" for dismissal under Hall. 

The time period for appealing the February 2021 decision has now elapsed. In a January 21, 2025, letter, the Veteran and his then-representative were informed that the June 15, 2023, VA Form 10182 (NOD) was not timely. The letter provided them an opportunity to respond as to why they believed the NOD in question should be accepted, or to argue a good cause reason to grant a time extension to submit the VA Form 10182. Neither the Veteran nor his then-representative responded to the letter. 

Having reviewed the claims file, the Board concludes that neither the Veteran nor his former representative filed any document that can be construed as a timely request for extension.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

Accordingly, dismissal of the Veteran's the appeal of the "denial of back claims" claim is warranted. See Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 330 (2021); see also Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269-272.
