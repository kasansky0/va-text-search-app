FINDING OF FACT

On October 3, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through her authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for pulmonary nodules by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea to include chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

3. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for pulmonary nodules by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

4. The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for chronic bronchitis by the Veteran's authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 22, 1978, to October 15, 1980, and from July 14, 2005, to May 3, 2006.  The Veteran had additional unverified periods of active service and inactive service in the United States Naval Reserve. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A hearing was not held in this matter as the Veteran's authorized representative requested withdrawal of the appeal on October 3, 2024. 

The Board notes that the September 2023 Rating Decision granted service connection for chronic bronchitis and rated it along with the Veteran's previously service-connected obstructive sleep apnea, effective August 10, 2022.  The prior 50 percent disability rating for obstructive sleep apnea was maintained.  Additionally, a January 2025 Rating Decision granted service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rated it alongside the previously service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and chronic bronchitis.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for pulmonary nodules is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea to include chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for pulmonary nodules is dismissed.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for chronic bronchitis is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  38 C.F.R. §20.205(b)(1).

In the present case, on October 3, 2024, the Veteran's authorized representative submitted a written statement, including the Veteran's name, her VA file number, and a request that the appeals regarding pulmonary nodules and chronic bronchitis be withdrawn.  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
