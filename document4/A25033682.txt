ORDER

Service connection for an umbilical hernia is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's umbilical hernia was incurred during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an umbilical hernia have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2016 to June 2022.

The case is on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision.

In a May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Direct Review option.  Therefore, the Board has considered the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 rating decision.

The May 2024 NOD, in addition to the above-captioned issue, also listed service connection for depression.  However, because the NOD was not received within one year of any notice of decision pertaining to the Veteran's depression claim, the Board does not have the authority to adjudicate this issue.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1)(ii).

Service connection for an umbilical hernia.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his umbilical hernia is due to an abdomen strain during service.  See May 2023 claim.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022 and was diagnosed with an umbilical hernia.  The Veteran reported to the examiner that he noticed the onset of the hernia, first manifested as a small, painful bulge, during active duty in 2020.  The Veteran is competent to report the onset lay-observable symptoms, and the Board will thus assign his statements evidentiary weight.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Accordingly, a current disability and in-service incurrence have been established.

Regarding nexus, there is no medical opinion of record.  However, particularly considering the proximity of the Veteran's claim and VA examination to his separation from active duty, the Board finds the lay evidence in this case sufficient to establish etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  No hernia was noted during the Veteran's April 2015 enlistment examination.  The Veteran separated from active duty in June 2022.  During the October 2022 VA examination, the Veteran informed the examiner that he noticed the onset of a small, painful bulge near his navel in 2020 which gradually became larger and became more tender.  As previously noted, the Veteran is competent to report lay-observable symptoms, and his statements establish the continued presence of his umbilical hernia from active duty to present.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's umbilical hernia was incurred during active duty.  This is particularly so when reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for an umbilical hernia warranted.
