REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from November 1982 to March 1983 and from February 1991 to June 1991.  The Veteran had additional duty with the Marine Corps Reserve.  

In November 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  In April 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction identified a duty to assist error as to the issue of service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In August 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran disagreement with an October 2010 rating decision denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss and an April 2020 rating decision denying a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.  In October 2024, the Board informed the Veteran that the VA Form 10182 as to those issues was untimely and therefore the issues were not docketed.  Accordingly, the issues are not on appeal and will not be addressed below. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted as the claimed disability is related to his conceded noise exposure associated with his military duties as a motor vehicle operator. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) duty to assist includes, in appropriate cases, the duty to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination which is accurate and fully descriptive. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121, 124 (1991). When VA undertakes to obtain an evaluation, it must ensure that the evaluation is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

An October 1997 Marine Corps Reserve Annual Certificate of Physical Condition states that the Veteran was seen by a Dr. Kammer, an Ear, Nose, or Throat (ENT) doctor, who "found 'some' hearing loss in right ear." 

The record reflects that the Veteran served with the Marine Corps Reserve from April 1982 to September 2002.  The Veteran's periods of active duty, active duty for training, and inactive duty for training with the Marine Corps Reserve have not been verified and all service medical documentation associated with any such duty has not been requested for association with the record.  That is a pre-decisional error.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and/or the appropriate service entity and request that the Veteran's periods of active duty, active duty for training, and inactive duty for training with the Marine Corps Reserve be verified and all available service treatment records associated with that duty be forwarded for incorporation into the record.
