FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's gastroesophageal reflux disease began during active service.

2. The presumption of aggravation that the increase in severity of the Veteran's allergic rhinitis was due to the natural progression of the disease was not proven by clear and unmistakable evidence. 

3. The Veteran's diabetes is proximately due to the Veteran's service-connected relapsing polychondritis.

4. There is no earlier communication, statement, or formal or informal claim dated before the Veteran's November 17, 2021 intent to file the claim for an increased rating for a right thumb disability. 

5. There is no earlier communication, statement, or formal or informal claim dated before the Veteran's August 13, 2020 intent to file a claim for service connection for polychondritis.

6. The Veteran's relapsing polychondritis is manifest by swelling and x-ray evidence of involvement in 2 or more major joints, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.

7. The Veteran's right ear relapsing polychondritis is not manifest by deformity of one auricle, with loss of one-third or more of the substance of the auricle. 

8. The Veteran's left ear relapsing polychondritis is not manifest by deformity of one auricle, with loss of one-third or more of the substance of the auricle.

9. The Veteran is in receipt of a total schedular rating.

10. The evidence of record does not demonstrate that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) furnished hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination at a VA facility that caused an additional disability. 

11. New and relevant evidence has been received with the supplemental claim of entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome.

12. New and relevant evidence has been received with the supplemental claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction. 

13. New and relevant evidence has been received with the supplemental claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye condition/cataracts.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1978 to October 1984 and from October 1985 to July 2003.

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decisions on appeal in March 2022 (allergic rhinitis, eye, CFS, GERD, polychondritis, DM), September 2022 (right thumb, TDIU), October 2022 (thyroid). The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the supplemental claim rating decisions regarding the thyroid surgery claim, TDIU, the right thumb, chronic fatigue syndrome, polychondritis, erectile dysfunction (ED), kidney, sleep apnea, diabetes, allergic rhinitis, eye, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) claims. In March 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which also found that new and relevant evidence had not been received on the GERD, ED, and eye claims. Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of those supplemental claim rating decisions that were subject to the HLR request.

In May 2023 and August 2023, the AOJ issued rating decisions after a special review of the file, which denied service connection for allergic rhinitis and GERD, and granted service connection for relapsing polychondritis. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket for the issues of GERD, allergic rhinitis,  polychondritis, the thyroid surgery claim, TDIU, ED, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes,  eye condition, and the right thumb. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the relevant AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of chronic fatigue syndrome, ED, and bilateral eye condition/cataracts, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for gastrointestinal symptoms that he contends started from the time of his service during the Gulf war and persisted throughout his military career. See November 2007 statement in support of the claim; September 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ; March 2024 VA Form 10182.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303. 

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following must be shown: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

As to the first element of service connection, that of a current diagnosis, the Veteran has a diagnosis of GERD. See VA treatment records dated January 30, 2023. Thus, the first element of service connection is met.?? 

As to the second element of service connection, that of an in-service injury, disease, or incurrence, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) document the Veteran's multiple episodes of gastrointestinal distress, including specific complaints of nausea from heartburn. See STRs dated August 30, 1982, November 1982, and January 1, 1990. Thus, the second element of service connection is met.

As to the third element of service connection, that of a causal connection (nexus) between the in-service incurrence and the current diagnosis, there are conflicting opinions as to the causation of the Veteran's GERD. See VA medical opinions dated) June 25, 2023 (denying nexus between GERD and the steroids taken to treat irritable bowel syndrome); July 25, 2023 (denying nexus between GERD and polychondritis or steroids taken for it). However, no clinician has yet opined on a direct nexus connection, and the opinions are, therefore, insufficient. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?45, 53 (2011) (the duty to assist includes investigation of service connection theories that are reasonably raised by the record).

Further, the clinician conducting the opinion noted that GERD can be due to a variety of factors, including Helicobacter Pylori infections, and documented that the Veteran tested positive for Helicobacter Pylori. This positive result was first obtained January 25, 2007, less than four years since the Veteran's separation from service. See VA medical opinion dated June 25, 2023; private treatment records dated January 25, 2007. The private treatment records document the Veteran's GERD was already being treated at the time of the positive infection. See private treatment records dated September 27, 2006. 

In consideration of above, the available treatment records evidence a continuity of symptomology sufficient to prove a nexus. Thus, with resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the third element of service connection is met. 

In conclusion, as the three elements of service connection are met, service connection on a direct basis is warranted. Thus, with resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the claim for service connection for GERD is granted. See?38?U.S.C. §?5107(b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102; Lynch?v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (2021). 

2. Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran seeks service connection for allergic rhinitis that he contends is due to Gulf War exposures. See September 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

The Veteran noted sinusitis and hay fever on his July 14, 1978 entrance report of medical history. The March 2021 rating decision documents the same, and that the Veteran received treatment for hay fever and allergic rhinitis throughout service.    

In Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (2004), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held if a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder. In that case, 38 U.S.C. § 1153 applies and the burden falls on the veteran to establish an increase in disability during service. If the presumption of aggravation attaches, the burden shifts to the government to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. Id; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

Here, there is a showing of an increase in the severity of the noted preexisting disability during service. In January 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA rhinitis examination, and the clinician specifically noted that the rhinitis had progressed/worsened since onset. Because the evidence of record shows that there was an increase in the severity of rhinitis during service, the presumption of aggravation attaches. Again, to rebut the presumption of aggravation, there must be clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306.  

Clear and unmistakable evidence is defined as obvious or manifest. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence "'cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable.'" Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009). 

Temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a pre-existing injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered "aggravation in service" unless the underlying condition, as contrasted to symptoms, is worsened. Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). The occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Evidence of a veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service, with an exacerbation of symptoms during service, does not constitute evidence of aggravation. Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1991). If the disorder becomes worse during service and then improves due to in-service treatment to the point that it was no more disabling than it was at entrance into service, the disorder has not been aggravated by service. Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996).  

Although the clinician here specifically noted that the condition had progressed/worsened since onset, the clinician opined the condition was not aggravated beyond its natural progression because the natural progression of allergic rhinitis manifests as increasing symptoms over time as the immune system changes with age. See March 2021 VA rhinitis opinion. However, the clinician provided no rationale, no citations to medical literature, and no specific examples from the Veteran's treatment records to bolster the bare assertion that, in this case, the Veteran's rhinitis had worsened because of his advancing age. See Nieves-Rodrigues v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. (2008) (to be entitled to probative weight, a?medical?opinion must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned explanation connecting the two). 

Thus, in this case, there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that there was no increase in severity, or that the increase in severity was due to the natural progression of the disease. Therefore, the presumption of aggravation has not been rebutted. Service connection based upon aggravation of a pre-existing disability is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306.

3. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes, as secondary to service-connected relapsing polychondritis.

The Veteran seeks service connection for diabetes that he contends is secondary to his service-connected disabilities that caused him to become obese. See November 2021 VA Form 20-0995; March 2023 VA Form 20-0996. Here, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is proximately caused by his service-connected disabilities.

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). 

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc). Where a service-connected disability aggravates a nonservice-connected condition, a Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. Id.

The evidence shows that the Veteran has a diagnosis of type II diabetes. See VA treatment records dated August 31, 2021. Likewise, the Veteran is service connected for multiple musculoskeletal disabilities as well as relapsing polychondritis. See May 2023 rating decision. 

Therefore, at issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's diabetes is proximately caused or aggravated by his service-connected disability or disabilities.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's VA treatment records document steroid-induced diabetes. See VA treatment records dated September 12 - 13, 2014. Likewise, the Veteran requires chronic steroids to treat his service connected polychondritis. See id.; private treatment records dated January 13, 2015, March 2, 2015, and August 19, 2015 (documenting diabetes "pred [Prednisone] induced"); VA treatment records dated March 30, 2022; March 2021 VA hand and finger examination. 

Against the claim is the VA clinician's opinion that the Veteran's claimed diabetes is not secondary to his service-connected orthopedic conditions. See January 2022 VA diabetes examination and associated opinion. However, this negative nexus opinion is based on a theory of secondary service connection as to the Veteran's orthopedic conditions and is thus insufficient in that it does not address the other theories of service connection reasonably raised by the records. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011) (the duty to assist includes investigation of service connection theories that are reasonably raised by the record).

In sum, the Board finds that there is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to whether the Veteran's current diabetes is proximately caused by his service-connected relapsing polychondritis; specifically, the medications required to treat it. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for diabetes as secondary to relapsing polychondritis is warranted.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the claim of service connection for a right thumb disability. 

The Veteran is appealing the effective date of the initial grant of service connection for a right thumb disability. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The AOJ awarded service connection for the residuals of a right thumb fracture as of October 29, 2009 in its June 2011 rating decision. It assigned a noncompensable evaluation from October 29, 2009, the day of receipt of the claim. The Veteran did not appeal within one year of the notice of the determination, and thus, the decision became final. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. For an increased rating claim, the effective date shall be the later of either the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

An effective date for a claim for increase may also be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(1), (2); see also, Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (referencing the "one-year look-back period"). As with any claim, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any matter material to the claim, the claimant shall be given the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

In general, "date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information or evidence was received by the VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r). A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). A "claim" means a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Here, the Veteran next filed a VA Form 21-8940 for increased compensation based on unemployment (TDIU) on April 6, 2022, noting that, in part, his right-hand fracture prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupations. The AOJ requested a hand examination, which it undertook in May 2022. As a result, the AOJ increased the disability rating, from zero to 10 percent, in its September 2022 rating decision. This was effective April 6, 2022, the date of receipt of the TDIU claim. 

However, the Veteran submitted an intent to file the claim for TDIU on November 17, 2021. As such, the proper effective date for the increased rating for a right thumb disability is November 17, 2021. As no earlier date is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of the intent to file, no earlier date than November 17, 2021 is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(1), (2). Therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2021, for the claim of service connection for a right thumb disability is granted. 

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the claim of service connection for polychondritis. 

The Veteran is appealing the effective date of the initial grant of service connection for polychondritis. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The AOJ awarded service connection for polychondritis, for both ears, effective the first day eligible under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act). See May 2023 rating decision. 

The Veteran filed an intent to file on August 13, 2020, in advance of his initial claim, filed on September 15, 2020. See VA Form 21-526EZ.

Here, the Veteran underwent a VA Gulf War examination and received an associated opinion documenting that the Veteran's polychondritis is at least as likely as not caused by the TERA. In other words, the clinician found a positive nexus on a direct, facts found, basis. The clinician cited to multiple sources documenting a causative connection between polychondritis and the toxic exposures already conceded in this case. See May 2023 VA medical opinion. As the nexus is a direct causative connection, and not presumptive based on the PACT Act, the effective date of this award of compensation is based on the date of receipt of the intent to file the claim, continuously pursued; here, August 13, 2020. See November 2021 supplemental claim and March 2023 higher level review request. Therefore, an earlier effective date of August 13, 2020 for service connection for polychondritis is granted. 

6. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis, of 20 percent, under Diagnostic Code 5009. 

7. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis, of 10 percent, under Diagnostic Code 6204.

8. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis of the right ear, under Diagnostic Code 6207.

9. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis of the left ear, under Diagnostic Code 6207.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis. See March 2024 VA Form 10182.

Disability ratings are assigned in accordance with VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1. When a question arises as to which of two ratings shall be applied under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Nevertheless, where the evidence contains factual findings that show a change in the severity of symptoms during the rating period on appeal, assignment of staged ratings would be permissible. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Additionally, the effective date of an award of increased compensation may be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if an application for increase in compensation is received within one year from such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Specifically, the veteran is only entitled to an effective date prior to the date of claim if an increase in disability occurred during the year before the claim was filed. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (2010).

The Veteran is service connected for relapsing polychondritis of both the left and right ear at an evaluation of zero percent, effective since that date of service connection, currently, August 10, 2022. See May 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87; Diagnostic Code (DC) 6299-6207. 

Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The additional DC 6207, shown after the hyphen, represents the basis for the rating, while the primary DC indicates the underlying source of the disability.

Under DC 6207, for loss of auricle, complete loss of both auricles warrants a 50 percent disability rating. Complete loss of one auricle warrants a 30 percent disability rating. Deformity of one auricle, with loss of one-third or more of the substance of the other auricle, warrants a 10 percent disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87; DC 6207.

In March 2021, the Veteran underwent a VA ear examination. The clinician documented recurrent ear pain with damage to the cartilage of the auricles, as well as intermittent vertigo. On physical examination, the clinician noted "mottling" of the auricular cartilage, classifying the loss as deformity of less than one-third of the substance. See March 2021 VA ear examination. The clinician documented the course since onset as "improved." Id.

The Veteran also underwent a VA non-degenerative arthritis examination in March 2021. The clinician documented the course of the relapsing polychondritis that causes chronic and significant pain and vertigo, requiring continual treatment of immunomodulating medications to control the pain and limit the flare-ups. Specifically, the clinician noted pain to the bilateral hands, shoulders, and knees, with intermittent swelling, and acute flare ups.   

In May 2023, the Veteran again underwent a VA ear examination. Upon physical examination, the clinician documented normal auricles, both left and right. The clinician documented no scars. The Veteran's symptoms were vertigo, pain, and fatigue. See May 2023 VA ear examination and medical opinion. 

Applying the results of the 2021 and 2023 physical examinations above to the disability ratings schedule for DC 6207, the disabilities of the right and left ears are appropriately rated at zero percent. Thus, for the manifestations of the Veteran's bilateral ear polychondritis, the currently assigned zero percent rating is warranted. 

However, the diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis reflects the condition is progressive, chronic, recurring and not necessarily solely limited to the cartilage of the ear. See March 2021 VA non-degenerative arthritis examination. 

With respect to the Veteran's complaints of pain associated with the relapsing polychondritis, the Board is cognizant of the holding in Saunders v. Wilkie. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Saunders states that where pain causes functional impairment, a disability for VA compensation purposes exists, even if there is no underlying diagnosis. Id. In sum, pain alone resulting in functional impairment is in fact a disability and should not be summarily discounted as a bar to benefits based on a finding of no current diagnosis. 

Although pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute functional loss. Pain must affect some aspect of "the normal working movements of the body" such as "excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," to constitute functional loss. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011). Where a claimant has a full range of motion with pain, or a noncompensable limitation of motion that is accompanied by pain, a 10 percent rating may be appropriate. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011). Painful motion should be considered to determine whether a higher rating is warranted on such basis, whether arthritis is present or not. See Burton, 25 Vet. App. at 5.

Under DC 5009, 'other specified forms of arthropathy,' the AOJ is to rate the acute phase under DC 5002; and any chronic residuals under DC 5003. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; DC 5009, Note 2. Under DC 5003, the AOJ is to rate arthritis established by X-ray findings based on limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved (DC 5200 etc.). When however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined, not added under DC 5003. Limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion. In the absence of limitation of motion, the AOJ is to rate as below: With X-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations as 20 percent disabling, and with X-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups as 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; DC 5003.

Here, the Veteran does claim, and his medical records show, that he experiences functional impairment due to his claimed relapsing polychondritis, due to significant pain, inflammatory symptoms, and vertigo, especially during flare-ups of this condition. See April 2021 VA non-degenerative arthritis examination; November 2007 statement in support of claim. At times of flare up, the Veteran will require high doses of immunosuppressant medications. Id. Moreover, the condition causes joint pain throughout the body, as well as eye pain. Id. Specifically noted are the joints of the shoulders, knees, and bilateral hands. Id. As such, the Veteran's polychondritis amounts to a functional impairment of earning capacity, and a 20 percent disability rating under DC 5003 is warranted. See March 2021 VA shoulder examination. 

Further, under DC 6204, vertigo, as a peripheral vestibular disorder, warrants a 30 percent disability rating for dizziness and occasional staggering. Occasional dizziness warrants a ten percent disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87; DC 6204. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 (2017) (holding that the rating criteria for hearing loss do not discuss or account for other functional effects, such as dizziness, vertigo, or ear pain). 

Regarding the Veteran's vertigo, he has received the diagnosis of vertigo secondary to relapsing polychondritis, International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Code H81.10 for benign paroxysmal vertigo. See VA ear examination dated March 2021. Specifically, the Veteran experiences "intermittent vertigo" with "random episodes of feeling like the room is spinning." Id. As the diagnostic codes used to evaluate the Veteran's relapsing polychondritis do not address the vertigo he experiences, an additional diagnostic code addressing the vertigo is warranted. As the vertigo is intermittent, and falls have not been documented, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted here. See, e.g., VA treatment records dated September 16, 2021 (noting not a fall risk).  

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided, however. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

Here, the Veteran is service connected for degenerative arthritis of the right and left knee, which are rated under the DC 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg. As such, a disability rating under DC 5010, which is rated under DC 5003, is not pyramiding because the relapsing polychondritis is a distinct disability; moreover, it is a non-degenerative arthritis. See e.g., Esteban, 6 Vet. App. at 262. Further, the Veteran is not service connected for the shoulders, or for arthritis of the hands, these among those joints specifically noted to be painful in the non-degenerative arthritis examination. See April 2021 VA non-degenerative arthritis examination. Finally, the Veteran's vertigo has not been contemplated by any assigned diagnostic rating criteria yet. 

The Board finds there is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in favor of the Veteran's claim for a compensable disability rating for relapsing polychondritis under the DC addressing non-degenerative arthritis and for vertigo under the DC that addresses vestibular disorders. See?Lynch?v. McDonough,?21 F.4th 776 (2021); 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102. Specifically, a 20 percent disability rating, under DC 5010 is warranted, as of the date of service connection on of August 13, 2020, and a 10 percent disability rating, under DC 6204. 

Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a 20 percent disability rating, under DC 5010, and a 10 percent disability rating, under DC 6204, is warranted. Therefore, the claim for an initial compensable disability rating is granted. However, the claims for increased disability ratings under DC 6207 are denied, for the reasons detailed above. 

10. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), as of November 17, 2021.

During the period on appeal here for TDIU, from November 17, 2021 through September 9, 2022, the Veteran was not previously eligible for TDIU on a schedular basis. See intent to file claim for TDIU dated November 17, 2021. This was because his combined disability evaluation was 90 percent (30 percent from irritable bowel syndrome and headaches, 20 percent from a left ankle spring, and lumbar spine degenerative joint disease, and 10 percent bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, tinnitus, bilateral knee degenerative arthritis, and between zero and ten percent right had fracture).

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340 (a)(1). Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, 38 C.F.R. Part 4, prescribes a 100 percent evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340 (a)(2). 

Here, in consideration of the above findings of an earlier effective date and initial compensable disability ratings, a 100 percent schedular rating is attained. Specifically, the claims of earlier effective date, of August 13, 2020, for the claim of service connection for a right thumb disability, and the entitlement to initial compensable disability ratings for relapsing polychondritis, of 20 percent, under DC 5009, and of 10 percent, under DC 6204, as of August 13, 2020, combine and now prescribe a 100 percent evaluation for the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2). Thus, entitlement to the grant of TDIU, as of November 17, 2021, is warranted.

11. Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for thyroid surgery.

The Veteran seeks compensation for "thyroid surgery" for the cause of an additional disability due to treatment. See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; March 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The AOJ denied entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for thyroid surgery in its October 2022 rating decision. It denied the claim because the evidence failed to establish that the VA was the proximate cause of an additional disability. Again, in March 2023, the AOJ denied entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for thyroid surgery, on the same basis. See March 2023 Higher-level Review rating decision. It made the favorable finding that the Veteran underwent right inferior and left superior parathyroidectomy, however, on May 7, 2019. Id.

Section 1151(a) of title 38, U.S. Code, provides that a veteran may be compensated for a "qualifying additional disability" if that disability was not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct and is actually and proximately caused by VA medical care or treatment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1). "To determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the... medical or surgical treatment... upon which the claim is based to the veteran's condition after such... treatment." 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b). An additional disability is caused, in fact, by VA medical care or treatment where the care or treatment "resulted" in the disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1). An additional disability is proximately caused by VA medical care or treatment where it results from either the "carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault" on the part of VA, or from "an event not reasonably foreseeable." 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(1).

To be entitled to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a), a claimant must show that an additional disability was not merely coincidental with VA medical treatment, but stems from some fault in the care with which he or she was provided, including "carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or some other similar instance of fault." 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(1); Mangham v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 284, 288 (2009).

Turning to the evidence of record here, there is no evidence the Veteran has undergone "thyroid surgery" at any time, much less, during this period on appeal. See VA treatment records dated March 30, 2022 (documenting previous surgical history, which is silent for thyroid surgery); see also, VA treatment records dated September 7, 2021 (noting thyroid procedure, not surgery, to include fine needle aspirate of the left thyroid nodule, with benign cytopathology in both 2018 and 2021). Thus, the evidence of record fails to show a VA thyroid surgery (i.e. medical care or treatment), or an additional disability caused thereby. Therefore, the Veteran's § 1151 claim for thyroid surgery fails on those bases. 

However, it is possible the Veteran intended to raise a claim for parathyroid surgery, because he has undergone surgical treatment on the parathyroid glands, detailed further below. The Board interprets a veteran's submission broadly, and so it will address a § 1151 claim for parathyroid surgery. See, e.g., Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). 

The Veteran's records document he received VA surgical care. Specifically, he underwent a right inferior and left superior parathyroidectomy. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b); see also, May 7, 2019 VAMC Report of Hospitalization; VA treatment records dated May 7, 2019. The documented indications for surgery were symptomatic hypercalcemia in the presence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Id. Imaging of the neck had demonstrated a possible parathyroid adenoma measuring 0.5 by 0.8 centimeters. Id.

As to whether the Veteran has an "additional disability" from parathyroid surgery, the Veteran does not specify what additional disability he is claiming in his July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ and March 2024 VA Form 10182. Further, the record does not reflect any event during the VA parathyroid surgery that may have caused an additional disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b) (to determine whether there is an additional disability, the VA is to compare a veteran's condition immediately before surgical treatment to after treatment). At discharge home, the Veteran was in stable condition. See VA treatment records dated May 8, 2019. 

Further, there is no evidence of an additional disability further removed in time from the parathyroid surgery. At the Veteran's post-surgery follow up appointment, he noted feeling tired and his blood pressure had been high since before the surgery. Id. The physician added an antihypertensive medication and advised a low sodium diet. Specifically noted was the well healed incision. Id. May 22, 2019. He was instructed, among other things, to take a calcium supplement, to continue testosterone treatment, taking vitamin D, and to continue weight bearing exercise. Id. May 22, 2019. He was cautioned he remained at additional risk to developing osteopenia from the use of chronic steroids for polychondritis treatment. Id. September 20, 2019. Accordingly, as to the question of whether the Veteran had an additional disability at this point, the answer remains negative. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b).

The Board notes that the Veteran's hypercalcemia did not ultimately resolve following surgery. As such, a discussion of whether the Veteran's hypercalcemia could be an "additional disability" is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(1). Detailed further below, the Board finds that it is not. 

Here, as early as 2018, the Veteran was known to have elevated urine calcium levels. See id. March 9, 2018. He had a diagnosis of hypercalciuria. Id. April 6, 2018. Tested before surgery, the Veteran's blood calcium level was elevated at 10.8 milligrams per deciliter (MG/DL). See VA treatment record dated April 16 and October 18, 2019. After surgery, his blood calcium level was within normal limits. Id. May 22, 2019. Upon recheck, it was 11.0 MG/DL. Id. September 20, 2019. In December 2019, the Veteran's endocrinologist again noted elevated calcium. The doctor "discussed with him he might have residual disease." Id. December 30, 2019. By January 2020, the endocrinologist documented elevated calcium levels and residual disease. Id. January 29, 2020.

As the Veteran has had hypercalcemia thorough the course of his hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, nor hypercalciuria, can be an "additional disability." It pre-existed the surgical treatment. The claim of an additional disability, therefore, fails. As such, the Board need not address causation of an additional disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(1).    

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, for either thyroid surgery, or a parathyroid surgery. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome, ED, and a bilateral eye condition/cataracts, previously denied on the basis that no new and relevant evidence had been submitted. 

New and Relevant Evidence

In general, decisions of the AOJ or the Board are final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103. However, VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1). New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). Relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue. Id. In other words, relevant evidence relates to a fact, not yet established, that tends to substantiate the claim.

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome.

The Veteran seeks service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome that he contends is due to Gulf War and other in-service exposures. See November 2021 VA Form 20-0995 and associated statement in support. He was afforded a record review in February 2022 and medical opinion regarding the fatigue. Thereafter, in March 2022, the AOJ denied service connection based on receiving no relevant evidence. See March 2022 rating decision. 

The Board finds the statement in support of the supplemental claim and medical opinion constitute new and relevant evidence. New, as it was not previously considered, and relevant as it provides information that may prove or disprove a matter at issue, namely the clinician's summary of the history, onset, course, and symptoms of the Veteran's fatigue. See February 2022 and medical opinion.

2. Entitlement to service connection for (ED).

The Veteran received a VA male reproductive conditions examination and associated opinion, in March 2021, after the rating decision denying service connection for ED, in November 2020. Thereafter, in March 2022, the AOJ denied the Veteran's supplemental claim based on receiving no new and relevant evidence. See March 2022 rating decision. 

The March 2021 examination and opinion are new evidentiary submissions, having not been previously submitted to agency decisionmakers, and relevant because they contain detailed information about the onset, duration, and symptoms of the Veteran's ED. Moreover, the clinician opines on the etiology of the ED. See March 2021 male reproductive conditions examination (finding the Veteran's ED is due to his central hypogonadism related to his relapsing polychondritis).

3. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye condition/cataracts.

The Veteran received a VA eye conditions examination and associated opinion, in March 2021. Thereafter, in May 2021, the AOJ denied the Veteran's supplemental claim based on receiving no relevant evidence. See May 2021 rating decision. In June 2021, the AOJ again denied the service connection for a bilateral eye condition, finding no relevant evidence submitted. See June 30, 2021 rating decision. 

However, the March 2021 examination and opinion are relevant because they contain detailed information about the Veteran's eye condition's onset, duration, and symptoms. Moreover, the clinician opined on the etiology of the Veteran's eye condition. See March 2021 VA opinion (finding the Veteran's eye condition is due to his condition of polychondritis).

In sum, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for the fatigue, ED, and eye conditions based on new and/or relevant evidence not having been submitted. As such, the AOJ did not address the merits of the claim. See Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010). However, as discussed above, new and relevant evidence was obtained, and therefore readjudication of the claim is warranted. See id. 

Adjudication under the AMA limits the circumstances in which the Board may remand appeals to the AOJ for further development. Nevertheless, the Board has the duty to remand to correct any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Thus, a remand for initial readjudication on the merits is necessary, as the Veteran has a procedural right to have review of his appeal by the AOJ. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Undertake any additional development deemed necessary and readjudicate the claims of entitlement to service connection for CFS, ED, and an eye condition.
