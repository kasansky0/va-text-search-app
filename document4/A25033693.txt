ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for Parkinsonism is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Appellant's favor, the Veteran's Parkinsonism is presumptively due to herbicide agent exposure in the Republic of Vietnam.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for Parkinsonism have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116(a)(2), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1966 to August 1968. The Veteran died in May 2022. In July 2022, the Veteran's surviving spouse, the Appellant herein, was substituted as the claimant. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In April 2023, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023 rating decision. In August 2023, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In August 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental review lane rating decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In September 2024, the Appellant timely filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and requested Direct Review of the August 2023 HLR rating decision. However, based on the procedural history of this case, the Board construes the Appellant's September 2024 VA Form 10182 as seeking review of the August 2024 supplemental review lane rating decision.

The Board may therefore consider only the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 supplemental review lane rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Before his death, the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for Parkinsonism as a result Agent Orange exposure during his active service in the military. See April 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. Following the Veteran's death, the properly substituted Appellant herein asserted the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in the Republic of Vietnam, and that while the Veteran was receiving care at an Alzheimer's facility, a doctor there diagnosed Parkinsonism. See August 2023 Higher-Level Review Informal Conference Worksheet. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active-duty service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) the in service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation: "In the absence of proof of a present [i.e., current] disability there can be no valid claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); see also Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("The requirement of a currently existing condition is not contrary to the statute, and in fact comports with the other provisions of the statute as a whole."). 

A disability is current when it exists near or when a claim is filed, or at any point during the claim's pendency. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt is to be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Evidence is in approximate balance when the evidence in favor of and against an issue is equal or nearly equal. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). Evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule need not apply, however, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Id.

For the purpose of establishing service connection for a disability resulting from exposure to herbicide agents, certain diseases becoming manifest in a veteran who performed active military, naval, air, or space service in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, are presumptively considered to be the result of herbicide agent exposure during, and to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran had a current disability of Parkinsonism that is presumptively due to herbicide agent exposure during a period active military service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

Here, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran performed service in the Republic of Vietnam, that the Veteran had exposure to herbicide agents during his period of service in Republic of Vietnam, and that the Veteran's claimed Parkinsonism is a condition that is presumptively linked to such exposure. See August 2024 Rating Decision (favorable findings); July 2022 Herbicide Exposure Verification Memo. 

Thus, the remaining question for the Board is whether the Veteran had a current disability of Parkinsonism. 

Turning to the evidence, a February 2022 private medical evaluation by a doctor of neurobehavior and neurology for the Columbus Alzheimer Care Center is of record. The February 2022 private medical evaluator met the Veteran to perform an in-person physical examination, and noted a review of the Veteran's medical, family, and social history. On physical examination, the February 2022 private medical evaluator found that the Veteran's finger finesse movements were mild to moderately decreased particularly in amplitude, that his posture was mildly flexed at the waist, that he had paratonic rigidity of the upper extremities, that the Veteran was mildly and generally bradykinetic, and had intermittent random myoclonus of his upper extremities. See February 2022 Private Medical Record (evaluation letter, and neurological, physical examination form). The February 2022 private medical evaluation has significant probative weight, as it is from a doctor of neurobehavior and neurology who was involved in the evaluation and care of the Veteran, is based on an in-person physical examination of the Veteran, and is based on a review of the Veteran's medical, family, and social history. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-304 (2008); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-124 (2007). 

A July 2024 VA medical opinion by a physician of primary care is also of record. The July 2024 VA medical examiner noted a review of the Veteran's claims file and available medical evidence, and specifically listed several private medical and VA treatment records. However, the February 2022 private medical evaluation by the doctor of neurobehavior and neurology for the Columbus Alzheimer Care Center was not one of the records the July 2024 VA medical examiner specifically listed. 

On review, the July 2024 VA medical examiner opined the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of Parkinsonism. As support, the July 2024 medical examiner explained that Parkinsonism requires bradykinesia, along with either rest tremor or rigidity. See July 2024 VA Medical Opinion at 3. After reviewing the conflicting medical evidence, the July 2024 VA medical examiner stated there was no evidence that the Veteran suffered from rest tremor, or rigidity, or Parkinsonism related bradykinesia. The July 2024 VA medical examiner therefore concluded that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of Parkinsonism. See id. at 4. However, as noted above, the July 2024 VA medical examiner did not list, nor did the that medical examiner address, the February 2022 private medical evaluation by the doctor of neurobehavior and neurology for the Columbus Alzheimer Care Center, which found that the Veteran had both mildly general bradykinesia and paratonic rigidity. Consequently, the July 2024 VA medical opinion is not based on sufficient facts and data, and offers only limited probative value. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-124 (2007).

Weighing the record evidence, the Board finds the February 2022 private medical evaluation has the most probative weight on the issue of whether the Veteran had a current disability of Parkinsonism. As explained above, the February 2022 private medical evaluation was prepared by a doctor of neurobehavior and neurology who was involved in the evaluation and care of the Veteran, was based on an in-person physical examination of the Veteran, and a review of the Veteran's medical, family, and social history. Additionally, the February 2022 medical evaluation documents symptoms that are consistent with the July 2024 medical examiner's description of Parkinsonism. 

In contrast, the Board finds no compelling reason to accord the July 2024 VA medical opinion more probative weight than the February 2022 private medical evaluation, as the July 2024 VA medical examiner did not perform an in-person examination of the Veteran, did not address the findings from the February 2022 private medical evaluation, and, therefore, is not based on sufficient facts and data.

Finally, the Board has also considered the Appellant's lay assertions. See August 2023 Higher-Level Review Informal Conference Worksheet. Lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, or when the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or when lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, the Appellant is competent to report that the Veteran was diagnosed with Parkinsonism while he was receiving care from an Alzheimer's facility doctor, and these assertions are probative.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent, credible, and probative evidence of record is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran had a current disability of Parkinsonism presumptively due to herbicide agent exposure while performing active military service in the Republic of Vietnam. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

The claim of entitlement to service connection for Parkinsonism is granted.
