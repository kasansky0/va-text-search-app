REMAND

An evaluation in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with insomnia disorder and traumatic brain injury (TBI), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND 

The Veteran had active service from July 2008 to April 2012. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in April 2024. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, given that the Board is remanding the claim, the AOJ will consider such evidence when readjudicating the claim on appeal. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD with insomnia disorder and TBI.

The record reflects that when the Veteran requested higher-level review of the claim at issue as well as another claim not the subject of this appeal, the higher-level reviewer determined, as to the issue not before the Board, that a pre-decisional duty to assist error existed in the failure to obtain VA medical records from the Kansas City VA Medical Center prior to the December 2022 rating action.  

The Veteran's representative correctly points out that this would be a pre-decisional duty to assist error as well for the issue currently before the Board.  While not articulated by the representative, the reason is that while it is was not particularly alleged that those records would be relevant to this appeal, as they were VA medical records of which VA was aware, their relevance is not a consideration.  See Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Accordingly, the Board will remand for correction of this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Board is aware that the representative alleges the higher-level reviewer agreed that the VA examination at issue in this case was inadequate.  A review of the report of that meeting documents no such agreement.  The basis for this remand is limited to the deficiency as to obtaining the Kansas City VA records.  The AOJ is, of course, free to undertake any other development that appears warranted.

Accordingly, this appeal is REMANDED to the AOJ for the following action:

Determine whether any further records from the Kansas City VA medical facility remain outstanding following the efforts made to obtain such records since December 2022.  Obtain any such records from that facility that remain outstanding.
