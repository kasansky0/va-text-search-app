FINDING OF FACT

In a March 2025 correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran's representative requested a withdrawal of the appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection a spinal cord stroke injury, bilateral upper extremity disorders, and bilateral lower extremity disorders. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the issues of entitlement service connection for a spinal cord stroke injury, bilateral upper extremity disorders, and bilateral lower extremity disorders, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2007 to August 2017. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In a written statement received by VA on March 27, 2025, the Veteran's representative withdrew the appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for a spinal cord stroke injury, bilateral upper extremity disorders, and bilateral lower extremity disorders. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by an authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

As the Veteran's representative has withdrawn the appeal, there is no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration. See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020); Martinez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 320 (2023); see also Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2018).
