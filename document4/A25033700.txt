ORDER

VA correctly calculated and paid retroactive compensation benefits to the Veteran for the period from October 2021 through June 2022, and the appeal is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The retroactive VA compensation payment in the amount of $12,021.58 for the period from October 2021 through June 2022 was proper, and the Veteran is not entitled to additional retroactive compensation payment.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The retroactive VA compensation payment in the amount of $12,021.58 for the period from October 2021 through June 2022 was proper. 10 U.S.C. §§ 1413a, 1414; 38 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5305; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.700, 3.750, 3.751.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1985 to September 1985, October 1987 to March 1988, December 2004 to May 2007, and September 2007 to July 2015.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2022 decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that determined that the Veteran was entitled to a retroactive compensation payment of $12,021.58 for the period from October 2021 through June 2022.

In the August 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to additional retroactive VA compensation benefits for the period October 2021 through June 2022

In general, a veteran may not receive military retired pay and VA disability compensation concurrently. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5304, 5305. Where a veteran is eligible for both military retired pay and disability compensation, a waiver of military retired pay is necessary to receive disability compensation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.751. If a veteran's VA disability compensation is less than his retired pay, he will receive his full VA disability pay and his service department will reduce his military retired pay by the amount of his disability compensation. If VA disability compensation is greater than his retired pay, then the veteran will only receive VA disability compensation.

However, the Defense Authorization Acts of 2003 and 2004 established two programs which allow for the concurrent payment of military retired pay and VA disability compensation. If a veteran is eligible for one of the two programs, he may receive payment of both his retired pay and VA compensation. The two programs are known as Combat Related Special Compensation (CRSC) and Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payment (CRDP).

Eligibility for CRSC requires that a veteran must have completed 20 years of service and have a qualifying combat-related disability. A veteran must apply with his own service department, and the service department makes the determination as to whether the Veteran's disability/disabilities is/are considered combat-related thereby making the Veteran eligible for CRSC. 10 U.S.C. § 1413a. VA does not make such determination.

Eligibility for CRDP requires that a veteran must have served a minimum of 20 years of creditable service, including service in the National Guard and Reserves and have a combined VA disability rating of at least 50 percent. 10 U.S.C. § 1414. Unlike the CRSC, a veteran is not required to apply for this benefit; enrollment is automatic. However, as with the CRSC, the veteran's service department makes the determination regarding eligibility under the CRDP.

In pertinent part, in a July 2022 rating decision, a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) was granted effective September 21, 2021. Because the Veteran was not allowed to receive full military retired pay and full VA compensation at the same time, the July 2022 notification letter reflects that part of his VA compensation benefits were withheld from October 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022, to prevent overpayment. He received his full VA compensation benefits beginning July 1, 2022. He was notified that he may be eligible for full or partial concurrent receipt of VA compensation and military retired pay under the CRSC and CRDP programs. He was advised that his retired pay center (RPC) had been notified of this award and if the RPC determined that withholdings from his VA compensation should be retroactively adjusted due to CRSC/CRDP eligibility, VA would adjust his VA compensation accordingly. 

An August 2022 Audit Error Worksheet (AEW) reflects that the Veteran was eligible for the CRDP program from October 2021 through June 2022. Accordingly, he was owed retroactive payment of VA compensation withheld during that period. The August 2022 notification letter reiterates that the Veteran was entitled to a retroactive compensation payment of $12,021.58 for VA compensation withheld from October 2021 through June 2022. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to retroactive payment of VA compensation withheld for 9 days in September 2021 (September 21 - 30, 2021) (i.e., from the effective date of the grant of the TDIU rating to the end of the month) and through July 2022. 

However, the Board emphasizes that compensation payments are distributed the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective. Here, the TDIU rating was granted effective September, 21, 2021. Thus, the Veteran was correctly paid retroactive compensation benefits beginning October 1, 2021, for the award of the TDIU rating effective September 21, 2021.

Moreover, the July 2022 notification letter reflects that the withholding of VA compensation benefits ended in June 2022. The Veteran received full VA compensation benefits beginning July 1, 2022 (i.e., VA compensations benefits were not withheld for the period beginning July 1, 2022). 

The Veteran was determined eligible for the CRDP program from October 1, 2021, through June 30, 2022. Accordingly, VA benefits withheld to prevent overpayment of VA compensation due to his receipt of military retired pay was retroactively paid from October 1, 2021, through June 2022. Because no VA compensation benefits were withheld beginning July 1, 2022, additional retroactive VA compensation benefits payment through July 2022 is not warranted.

The Veteran was properly paid retroactive VA compensation benefits of $12,021.58 for the period from October 1, 2021, through June 2022. VA compensation benefits were not withheld July 2022; therefore, additional retroactive VA compensation payment is not warranted.
