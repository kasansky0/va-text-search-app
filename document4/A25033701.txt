ORDER

Entitlement to retroactive benefits in excess of 12 months of VA educational benefits under the Transfer of Benefits (TOB) program is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The appellant received retroactive education benefits for 24 months under the TOB program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from February 1999 to April 2010. The appellant is the Veteran's daughter. The Veteran's awards and decorations include but are not limited to the Joint Service Commendation Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (2nd Award), Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (5th Award), Joint Service Achievement Medal (2nd Award); Iraq Campaign Medal (4th Award).  The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his honorable service to our Nation!

The decisions on appeal were issued in April 2020 and February 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the appellant's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to retroactive benefits in excess of 12 months of VA educational benefits under the TOB program is dismissed.

In an April 2020 VA decision, VA denied the appellant entitlement to VA educational benefits. In February 2021, however, VA issued a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) showing that the appellant is entitled to 12 months of educational benefits for the period beginning July 29, 2014. 

The appellant is appealing VA's determination that she was entitled to 12 months of education benefits and sought additional educational benefits to complete an occupational therapy assistant certificate program at Northern Virginia Community College. Although she completed the program of study, the appellant sought retroactive benefits for the time she completed the program.

In February 2023, VA issued the appellant another COE showing that she was entitled to 24 months of VA educational benefits for the period beginning July 29, 2014. Additional documents in the claims file show that in approximately March 2023, VA approved the appellant's request for payment of VA educational benefits for the time period of 2015 to 2017, and paid $31,435.90 to the appellant for tuition, housing, along with books and supplies for her program of study at Northern Virginia Community College. 

Thus, the Board finds that the appellant has received the full benefit she sought on appeal, and there remains no controversy for appellate consideration, and the appeal is dismissed.
