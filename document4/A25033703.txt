DATE: April 10, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for abdominal scars, associated with laparoscopic partial nephrectomy due to right kidney cancer, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's abdominal scars are not deep, do not have an area of at least 39 square centimeters, are not unstable or painful, and do not result in any disabling effects.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for abdominal scars have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DCs) 7801-02, 7804-05 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1980 to June 1986. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his service.

This appeal to the Board arose from a June 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the requirement that the Board delay issuing a decision until the period to request to switch dockets elapses pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Entitlement to a compensable rating for abdominal scars. 

The Veteran's abdominal scars are currently assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) rating under DC 7802.  It was originally assigned a noncompensable rating under DC 7805. Scars are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DCs 7800 through 7805. The rating criteria for evaluating skin disorders under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 were amended effective August 13, 2018. As the Veteran's claim was received in February 2024, the Board will consider the amended and current rating criteria.

DC 7800 pertains to burn scars of the head, face, or neck; scars of the head, face, or neck due to other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. DC 7800 is not applicable in this matter, as the Veteran's scars are not located on his head, face, or neck.

DC 7801 states that burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage, in an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) will be assigned a 10 percent rating. Area or areas of at least 12 square inches (77 sq. cm) but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cm) is assigned a 20 percent rating. Area or areas of at least 72 square inches (465 sq. cm) but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) is assigned a 30 percent rating. Area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater is assigned a 40 percent rating.

Under DC 7802, a 10 percent rating is assigned when the scar(s) cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater. No other rating is provided by this Diagnostic Code. Note (1) states that a superficial scar is one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

DC 7804 provides that one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10 percent evaluation. A 20 percent rating is warranted when three or four scars are unstable or painful. A 30 percent rating is warranted when five or more scares are unstable or painful. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Id. at Note (1). If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, the rater is to add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Id. at Note (2). Scars evaluated under codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under DC 7804, when applicable. Id. at Note (3).

DC 7805 provides that other scars (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 require the evaluation of any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under DCs 7800-7804 under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

At the February 2024 VA examination, it was reported that the Veteran had six (6) scars on the anterior trunk, resulting from surgical treatments for cancer and inguinal hernias. Since surgical treatment, the scars have not required consistent treatment. It was noted that the midline abdominal scar under pannus would sometimes become inflamed or red due to friction, but overall scars do not impact overall quality of life or functional ability. They were not painful or unstable.  Size of each scar was measured as follows: scar 1 (right periumbilical scar) was 0.5 x 3.5 cm; scar 2 (right lateral abdominal scar) was 0.1 x 2.0 cm; scar 3 (right upper quadrant (RUQ) scar) was  0.5 x 0.1 cm; scar 4 (right midline lower abdomen) was 0.1 x 0.2 cm; scar 5 (midline abdomen scar) was 0.5 x 0.3 cm; and scar 6 (left lateral scar) was 0.1 x 0.1 cm. The approximate combined total area in centimeters squared for the anterior trunk was 2.18 sq cm. There was no functional impairment reported pertaining to the scars.

After a thorough consideration of the evidence, the Board finds that a compensable rating for the abdominal scars is not warranted. While it was noted that one scar became inflamed or red due to friction, the evidence has shown that the scars are not painful, unstable, or measure to a total area equal to or greater than 39 sq. cm. The scars are not deep or associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Additionally, the scars have not been shown to cause any limited motion and any other symptoms. The Veteran did not report experiencing any associating symptoms or limitations as a result of his abdominal scars, specifically the scar that becomes inflamed due to friction. There is no evidence indicating that his abdominal scars cause any impairments.

Accordingly, while the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's claim, entitlement to a compensable rating for abdominal scars are not warranted at this time and must be denied.
