ORDER

Readjudication of the claim for an extension of the delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 33 or the Post-9/11 GI Bill) is warranted.  To that extent only, the appeal is GRANTED.

Entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 or the Post-9/11 GI Bill is REMANDED. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a September 2019 decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim for Chapter 33 benefits exclusively on the basis that his delimiting date had expired on June 1, 2019.   

2. Evidence received since the September 2019 AOJ decision is new and tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the previously denied claim for entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, for Chapter 33 benefits.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudication of the previously denied claim for entitlement to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, beyond the June 1, 2019, delimiting date are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1982 to April 1989, and from January 1991 to May 2004.  

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office decision stemming from a May 2020 Supplemental Claim.  The decision confirmed and continued a previous September 2019 decision that denied educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33.  Specifically, the July 2020 decision found that no new and relevant evidence had been received to warrant reconsideration as to whether the Veteran's 15-year delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, to use his Chapter 33 benefits, was warranted.    

In the August 2020 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.   

The Board is adjudicating herein the issue as to whether new and relevant evidence has been received to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claim.  However, the Board is remanding the issue as to whether an extension of the delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, is warranted.  Thus, any evidence the Board could not consider with respect to that issue will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

I

New and Relevant Evidence -

Entitlement to educational benefits under Chapter 33

Under the rules of the modernized review system, veterans are required to present new and relevant evidence to warrant readjudication of their claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a), (d).  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Relevant evidence includes evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). 

In September 2019, the Veteran filed an initial application for educational assistance benefits (VA Form 22-1999) under Chapter 33 to pursue a program of education at Indiana University Kelley School of Business beginning on September 1, 2020.  

In a September 2019 decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for Chapter 33 benefits exclusively on the basis that his delimiting date had expired on June 1, 2019, 15 years from his last discharge from active duty on May 31, 2004.  38 U.S.C. § 3321(a)(1).  

In October 2019, the Veteran filed a request for Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996) along with new arguments and evidence raising a new theory of entitlement.  That is, an extension of his delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, because of a mental or physical disability that prevented him from pursuing his desired program of education within his period of eligibility.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3321(b); 3031(d).  

However, because under the Higher-Level Review option the evidentiary record is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the prior decision, in this case September 2019, the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence.  The Veteran was made aware of this regulatory requirement in a subsequent January 2020 Higher-Level Review decision.  The AOJ confirmed and continued the previous denial.         

Shortly thereafter, the Veteran submitted a lay statement in which he indicated that he is service-connected for coronary artery disease, hypertension and chronic fatigue syndrome.  He also indicated that in July 2017, he suffered a heart attack "and subsequently underwent heart surgery" which required recovery and rehabilitation that "consumed [his] time and attention from July 4, 2017 until August 2019."          

Thereafter, in May 2020 the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) in which he appealed the initial September 2019 decision.  The evidentiary record for a supplemental claim includes all evidence received by VA before VA issues notice of a decision on the supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(b).  Readjudication is warranted if the evidentiary record includes new and relevant evidence that was not of record as of the date of notice of the prior decision. Id.  The Veteran identified as new and relevant evidence the fact that he suffered a myocardial infarction/heart attack on July 4, 2017.  The Veteran reiterated that this event prevented him from using his education benefits before his delimiting date.       

The Board finds that the Veteran's arguments raising a new theory of entitlement not previously considered by the AOJ constitute new evidence after the September 2019 decision.  It is also relevant as it contains information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim.  Thus, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been submitted for the claim to be readjudicated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  To this extent only, the appeal is granted.     

II

Entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date beyond June 1, 2019, for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33

An individual is eligible for Chapter 33 educational assistance under the provisions of the Post - 9/11 GI Bill if, among other things, commencing on or after September 11, 2001, he or she serves an aggregate of at least 90 days on active duty in the Armed Forces (excluding entry level and skill training), and continues on active duty. 38 U.S.C. § 3311 (b)(8); 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520 (a)(1).

In this case, the Veteran's basic eligibility for Chapter 33 education benefits is not in dispute as he meets the service requirements set forth above.  Rather, the dispute concerns whether he is entitled to an extension of the delimiting date for those benefits.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that a remand is warranted on this case to correct a pre decisional duty to assist error.  

First, the Board finds that the Veteran timely filed his extension request for an extension of his delimiting date as it was within one year of the date that his original period of eligibility ended. 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.1033(c), 21.9535(a).

In the case of individuals whose last discharge or release from active duty is before January 1, 2013, the period of eligibility for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance will terminate effective 15 years from the date of the last discharge or release from active duty of at least 90 continuous days, or 30 continuous days if the veteran is released for a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9530.  In this case, there is no dispute that the Veteran's delimiting date was June 1, 2019, which is consistent with his May 31, 2004, discharge date.

However, the period of eligibility for educational benefits under Chapter 33 may be extended under the circumstances enumerated in 38 U.S.C. §§ 3031(b) through (d) as referenced by 38 U.S.C. § 3321(b).  With relevance here, 38 U.S.C. § 3031(d) provides that such period could be extended if there is existence of physical or mental disability.  

In the May 2020 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran identified VA treatment records not considered by the AOJ in the initial adjudication of his claim in September 2019.  The Veteran asserts that in July 2017, he suffered a myocardial infarction and underwent heart surgery that prevented him from pursuing his desired program of education before his delimiting date.  Also, in the lay statement previously received in January 2020, the Veteran indicated that the recovery and rehabilitation from his heart surgery prevented him from pursuing his education specifically from "July 4, 2017, to August 2019."   

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran is service-connected for hypertension since June 2004, and coronary artery disease associated with hypertension since November 2017.  Medical treatment records received and associated with the Veteran's claims file in November 2017 show that he suffered a myocardial infarction and underwent a left heart catheterization with ventriculography, right and left coronary angiography, a coronary stent placement, a balloon angioplasty and thrombectomy on July 4, 2017, at Lutheran Hospital Heart Center.

The controlling regulation provides that an extension of the period of eligibility, as determined in 38 C.F.R. § 21.9530, will be provided, in pertinent part, if the medical evidence clearly establishes that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the individual's willful misconduct.  VA will not consider an individual's disability for a period of 30 days or less as having prevented the individual from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the individual was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance due to the short-term disability.  38 C.F.R. § 21.9535(a)(1)(ii).  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a), the Board may remand a matter for correction of a pre-decisional error by the RO in fulfilling the duty to assist or any error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, no matter when made, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.  

The Board finds that the Veteran's January 2020 lay statement in support of his request for an extension of his Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits on the basis of a disability that prevented him from pursuing his education from July 2017 to August 2019, and the identification of the VA treatment records in possession of the St. Louis VA Medical Center as identified in his May 2020 supplemental claim, when considered along with the November 2017 medical records from Lutheran Hospital Heart Center, should have triggered VA's duty to assist to obtain the referenced medical evidence, to include a VA medical opinion to that effect to help him substantiate his claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  Review of the record shows that the medical evidence associated with the claims between 2017 and 2020 was submitted by the Veteran through the VA Claims Intake Canter.     

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that the AOJ's failure to obtain the VA treatment records identified by the Veteran in his May 2020 supplemental claim and to obtain a medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran was prevented from pursuing a program of education during the relevant times for the reasons advanced, and, if so, for how long, constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error that must be corrected on remand.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain and associate with the Veteran's claims file VA treatment records from the St. Louis VA Medical Center dated from July 2017, as identified in the May 2020 supplemental claim.    

2. Then, arrange to have an appropriate qualified clinician to review the relevant medical records and the statements advanced by the Veteran.  After reviewing the record, the clinician is asked to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's myocardial infarction in July 2017, to include any associated recovery and rehabilitation periods, prevented him from initiating or completing his chosen program of education during the pertinent eligibility period from July 4, 2017 (the onset of his disability) to June 1, 2019, (the end of his eligibility period).

If the Veteran was medically prevented for only a portion of that time frame, the VA clinician should specify, to the extent possible, the beginning and ending date(s) of the period(s) during which the Veteran was medically unable to pursue an educational program. 

If the Veteran was medically prevented for a period extending beyond his basic eligibility date (e.g., August 2019), the VA clinician should specify, to the extent possible, when the Veteran's disability no longer prevented him from beginning or resuming a program of education.

A complete rationale for all opinions expressed should be provided.

3. After the above directives have been complied with, readjudicate the matter on appeal.
