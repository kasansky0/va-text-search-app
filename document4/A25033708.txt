Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's left sciatic radiculopathy was productive of symptoms that were no more than mild. 

2. The Veteran had a combined rating of at least 70 percent, with at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more, and his service-connected disabilities had prevented him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a separate 10 percent rating, but not higher, prior to January 29, 2019, for left sciatic radiculopathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520 (20243).

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent beginning January 29, 2019, for left sciatic radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from November 1970 to August 1974. In September 2018, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form and selecting higher-level review (HLR). These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2019 HLR rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the March 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the hearing docket. In May 2023, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2018 RAMP opt-in, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b) (2024). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after VA received the RAMP opt-in and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801 (2024). 

By way of history, this case was previously denied by the Board in June 2024. The Veteran appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In February 2025, the Court granted a Joint Motion of the parties, vacated the Board's decision, and remanded the case to the Board for action consistent with the Joint Motion. The case has since been returned to the Board for further appellate action.

1. Increased Rating - Left Sciatic Radiculopathy

The Veteran contends that his service-connected left sciatic radiculopathy is worse than that contemplated by the currently assigned rating. His left sciatic radiculopathy is currently rated 10 percent disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. Additionally, the issue of entitlement to a separate rating for left sciatic radiculopathy prior to January 29, 2019, has been raised by the record in connection with the Board's prior adjudication of the Veteran's increased rating claim for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) (back disability), in June 2024. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, General Rating Formula, Note 1; Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

A review of private medical records show that the Veteran presented with back pain radiating into the lower left extremity in June 2015, September 2016, and December 2016. Furthermore, a private MRI of the lumbar spine in October 2016 revealed potential impingement on the bilateral L4 and L5 nerve roots.

In January 2017, the Veteran completed a disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) for back conditions. A private physician indicated that the Veteran had mild to moderate pain of the left lower extremity. The private physician concluded that the Veteran had mild to moderate, incomplete paralysis involving the sciatic nerve, left lower extremity. 

In April 2017, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for back conditions. He reported low back pain radiating down to the left buttocks and posterior thigh. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had moderate pain of the left lower extremity. However, the examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

In January 2019, the Veteran was provided an additional VA examination for back conditions. He reported low- to mid-back pain radiating down to the left thigh and below the knee. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had severe pain and moderate paresthesias/dysesthesias. His straight leg test result was positive. The private physician determined that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis involving the sciatic nerve, left lower extremity. The examination was unremarkable for any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms, to include muscle atrophy.

VA medical center (VAMC) records show that the Veteran has received additional treatment for his left lower extremity radiculopathy. However, there is no indication that his symptomatology is manifestly different from the findings discussed above.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a separate 10 percent rating prior to January 29, 2019, for left sciatic radiculopathy. In this regard, the Veteran demonstrated no more than sensory deficits, to include mild or moderate pain of the left lower extremity. From January 29, 2019, the Veteran demonstrated no more than sensory deficits, to include severe pain, moderate paresthesias/dysesthesias, and a positive straight leg raise test. Therefore, the weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran's left sciatic radiculopathy was, at worst, mild, throughout the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. 

The Board has considered assigning a higher rating. Although the Board is not bound by VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1), the M21-1 provides benchmarks for severe peripheral nerve conditions. See Overton v. Willkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 263-64 (2018). While the private physician in January 2017 indicated that the Veteran had mild to moderate incomplete paralysis, the weight of the evidence does not support that the Veteran has moderate incomplete paralysis involving the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment. These are cases where symptoms would likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling. In such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms. Additionally, other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category including combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520; M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c. Id. Moreover, subsequent VA examination report findings did not reflect moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Accordingly, the Board finds that a separate 10 percent rating, but not higher, prior to January 29, 2019, for left sciatic radiculopathy is warranted. However, a rating in excess of 10 percent beginning January 29, 2019, for left sciatic radiculopathy is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

2. TDIU

The Veteran claims that his service-connected disabilities have prevented him from securing or following a substantial gainful occupation. He is service-connected for bilateral pes planus with degenerative arthritis and plantar fasciitis status post right foot osteotomy (bilateral foot disability), hypertensive heart disease, hypertension, back disability, right and left sciatic radiculopathy, and right foot surgical scar. His combined rating is at least 70 percent with a disability, or separate disabilities combinable to at least 40 percent. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for assignment of a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran reported that he became too disabled to work in January 2014, at which time his service-connected disabilities prevented him from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment. In this regard, he stated that he last worked full-time as an inventory management specialist from May 2001 to January 2014. Additionally, he reported that he completed some college. 

In June 2014, a VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's bilateral foot disability impacted his ability to work. Specifically, the Veteran's bilateral foot disability impaired physical functions such as running, jumping, and prolonged walking and standing.

In December 2014, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations for hypertension and heart conditions. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's hypertensive heart disease and hypertension impacted his ability to work due to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, and METs level of greater than 5 to 7. 

In April 2017 and January 2019, VA back examiners indicated that the Veteran's back disability impacted his ability to work. The examiners noted that Veteran would be functionally limited in his ability to sit for prolonged periods and perform heavy lifting, repetitive stair climbing, and repetitive bending.

In a May 2023 statement, a private physician provided a vocational assessment and opinion. The Veteran reportedly stated that he had issues working at a desk position for eight hours per day due to back pain and fatigue. He remarked that he could not stand or walk for prolonged periods due to low back, right leg, and foot pain. With standing, he stated that he would have to hold onto table/counter/railing due to loss of balance. With walking, he noted that he would have to move slowly because he would easily lose his balance. He explained that his back, radiculopathy, and foot symptoms had worsened since he quit his job, and his worsening symptoms impacted all activities of daily living. Due to his heart condition, he would fatigue easily when doing any activity and stress affected his heart. He reported that he suffered from poor sleep due to his back and foot pain, which resulted in daytime sleepiness and the need for daily naps. He commented that pain medication made him drowsy and dizzy, which impacted his balancing. He remarked that pain, medications, and fatigue impacted his ability to concentrate and stay focused. The private physician opined that it was more likely than not that the combination of pain and limitations caused by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from being able to work since January 2014. 

Based on the Veteran's employment history and the functional limitations described above, the Board finds that he has been unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. In this regard, the subjective reports of record and the objective findings in the VA examination reports and private vocational opinion show that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities significantly impact his ability to function in an occupational setting. The Board highlights the Veteran's lengthy job history as an inventory management specialist. Additionally, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities limit his ability to perform sedentary tasks critical to his previous work. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is in approximate balance. Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to a TDIU is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
