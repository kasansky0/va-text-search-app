ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability evaluation due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted from December 12, 2023, but not earlier; subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record shows that from December 12, 2023, the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment solely because of his service-connected PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU with an effective date of December 12, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400 (o), 4.16(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1967 to March 1969.

In February 2025, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review a rating decision regarding the issue of entitlement to TDIU issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Board notes that the Veteran's 10182 did not specify a date of decision that the Veteran wished the Board to review, and that within the 12 months prior to VA's receipt of the Veteran's VA 10182, there are two AOJ rating decisions of record. The first of these was a July 29, 2024, rating decision denying a March 21, 2024, supplemental claim, which was later subject to Higher Level Review (HLR). The second of these decisions is the January 2025 rating decision on that HLR. Although it is ambiguous which rating decision the Veteran intended to appeal, the Board notes that in either case, the evidence review window is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding all issues on appeal as described on the title page, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a TDIU.

The Veteran contends that he is unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities.

A.	Legal Criteria

Where the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned when the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Consideration may be given to a Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at whether a TDIU rating is warranted, but the Veteran's age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities may not be considered in such a determination. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment, and for purposes 38 C.F.R. § 4.16, marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a Veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a)(5). Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts-found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Id.

A request for TDIU "...is not a separate claim for benefits, but rather involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim [...] or as part of a claim for increased compensation." Rice v. Shinseki 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). It is raised whenever a claimant seeks a higher disability evaluation and "presents cogent evidence of unemployability." Comer v. Peake, 553 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009). However, while a claim for increased disability compensation encompasses the issue of possible entitlement to TDIU, the issue is not raised until evidence of unemployability is actually presented. See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("Once a veteran submits evidence of a medical disability and makes a claim for the highest rating possible, and additionally submits evidence of unemployability, the 'identify the benefit sought' requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) is met and VA must consider TDIU.") "When entitlement to TDIU is raised during the adjudicatory process of the underlying disability or during the administrative appeal of the initial rating assigned for that disability, it is part of the claim for benefits for the underlying disability." Rice v. Shinseki 22 Vet. App. 447, 454 (2009).

A claimant bears the burden of demonstrating his or her entitlement to a particular benefit. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a) (a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits); Skoczen v. Shinseki, 564 F.3d 1319, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (recognizing that, the responsibilities of developing the evidence aside, the claimant bears the burden of establishing his or her entitlement to the benefits sought); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (explaining that the evidence must demonstrate entitlement to the benefit). However, the Board may not reject a claim based on unemployability "without producing evidence, as distinguished from mere conjecture, that the veteran can perform work that would produce sufficient income to be other than marginal." Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532, 537 (1994).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992). Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b). This benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is nearly equal but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. See Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

B.	Facts and Analysis

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's TDIU claim arises from an express claim for a TDIU dated October 22, 2022, and received by VA on October 28, 2022. See October 2022 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. The Veteran submitted another claim for TDIU, also dated October 22, 2022, received by VA on October 31, 2022. See October 2022 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based un Unemployability. A claim for a TDIU is a type of increased rating claim. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007). Accordingly, the earliest the Board may look for evidence of eligibility for a TDIU is October 28, 2021, which is one year prior to October 28, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o).

Next, the Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for posttraumatic stress disorder with traumatic brain injury with a 50 percent evaluation from March 22, 2022; and a 70 percent evaluation from April 25, 2023. The Veteran is also service connected for tension headaches associated with posttraumatic stress disorder with traumatic brain injury with a noncompensable evaluation from May 25, 2022, and a 50 percent evaluation from April 25, 2023. The Veteran is also service connected for right hand scars with healed fracture and residual disability with a 30 percent evaluation from March 7, 1969; and scars to the lower chest wall with a 20 percent evaluation from March 7, 1969. In addition, the Veteran has noncompensable evaluations for scars to the left leg and right middle finger; traumatic brain injury (TBI); bilateral hearing loss; and intertriginous dermatitis. See January 2025 Rating Decision - Codesheet. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the earliest date the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU is March 22, 2022, based on a single disability of 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the Veteran's combined evaluation to 70 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Turning to the evidence concerning the Veteran's employment status, the Board observes that on the first of the Veteran's two applications for a TDIU, he stated, simply, "covid," in the remarks section and left most of the Employment Statement section of the application blank. See October 28, 2022, VA 21-8940. In the second of his applications, which was submitted by the Veteran's accredited representative, the Veteran stated that his disabilities affected his full-time employment from November 1, 1972; that he last worked full-time on July 4, 1972, as a welder; and that he became too disabled to work on March 22, 2022. See October 31, 2022,VA 21-8940. The Veteran further stated on this form that he could not recall the most he had earned in one year, but that the year was 1972. Id. The Veteran supplied a present earned income of $0.00 per month and $0.00 in the last 12 months. Id. In the remarks section, the Veteran stated "covid problems cant work today[.]" Id.

Review of the medical evidence of record shows that at a September 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he had not worked since 1972. See September 2022 C&P Exam at 5. However, at a June 2010 VA urgent care visit after a right knee injury, the Veteran stated that at that time, he was working; was self-employed; and that his work required standing for an 8-hour day. See February 2023 CAPRI at 435.

The Board notes that the Veteran's stated reasons for being unable to work do not appear to be service-connected conditions. The Board also notes that the evidence concerning the Veteran's actual work history is unclear. Specifically, the Veteran's request for a TDIU expressly states only that the Veteran has not worked full time since 1972; that he became too disabled to work in March 2022; and that this was due, in his estimation, to covid or covid-like symptoms. It is not clear from the available evidence whether the Veteran's statement that he has not worked full-time since 1972 meant that he did not work at all; or that he worked part-time, or in a self-employed capacity in the interim, as his VA treatment records suggest might have been true.

To assist the Veteran in developing his claim and answering this uncertainty, the AOJ sent a November 2022 letter to the Veteran together with a VA 21-4192, Request for Employment Information. See November 2022 Subsequent Development Letter. The Veteran did not reply, so the AOJ sent a December 2022 letter requesting the same information a second time. See December 2022 Subsequent Development Letter. The Veteran again did not reply. The AOJ also sent the Veteran a March 27, 2024, letter requesting a more complete VA Form 21-8940, and a third request for a VA 21-4192. See March 2024 Subsequent Development Letter. The March 2024 letter expressly noted the mixed evidence concerning the Veteran's employment history, and, in light of the possibility of some current or past self-employment, expressly requested a statement regarding: types of work performed, number of hours worked per week, amount of time lost in last 12 months due to service-connected disabilities, and net and gross earnings for the last 12 months. Id. The Veteran did not reply.

A statement from the Veteran submitted by his accredited representative states only "PLEASE EXPEDITE CLAIM I AM HURTING." See July 2024 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran's VA 10182 also includes a request to expedite his claim "due to age and severity of disability," but contains no additional detail. See February 2025 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

With respect to the medical evidence of employability, numerous VA examinations from the period of appeal describe symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected conditions during this time, but none expressly state that the Veteran cannot achieve or maintain substantially gainful employment due solely to one or more of these conditions. The Board notes that the Veteran's service-connected TBI, headaches, and PTSD conditions were all claimed and evaluated as related to the Veteran's TBI condition. A February 2024 VA examination opined that while the Veteran's headache symptoms could be differentiated from his TBI condition, the remaining symptoms attributable to TBI could not be differentiated from the Veteran's PTSD condition without resorting to speculation. See February 2024 C&P Exam. The Board finds this opinion adequate for rating purposes and assigns it high probative weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. At 304 (2008) ("It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion ... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion.") Based on this examination, the Board finds that the Veteran's PTSD evaluation contemplates the Veteran's remaining TBI symptoms.

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his service-connected PTSD. See December 2023 C&P Exam. The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran. Id at 1. The examiner checked a box indicating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgement, thinking and/or mood. Id at 2. The Veteran reported that he had not worked since 1971. Id at 3. The examiner described the Veteran's symptoms, in relative part, as follows:

"He gets easily irritated and frustrated and small things can upset him. He throws his phone if it does not work. He has been having a hard time keeping up with his hygiene. He does not brushes his teeth. [...]

memory lapses necessitate external aids, and the veteran often zones out during conversations. Constant fatigue requires the reliance on energy drinks and coffee. Hypervigilance is apparent in strategic positioning and avoidance in public spaces. [...]

Emotionally, expressing feelings proves challenging, fostering a   sense of detachment from family and friends. Feelings of hopelessness, coupled with anger outbursts, further affect daily motivation and interpersonal relationships. [...]

Depressed mood, Anxiety, Suspiciousness, Panic attacks more than once a week, Chronic sleep impairment, Mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, Memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name, Flattened affect, Disturbances of motivation and mood, Difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, Difficulty in    adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, Inability to establish and maintain effective relationships Obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities, Impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence, Neglect of personal appearance and hygiene." Id at 3, 6.

Prior to this examination, the Veteran was last afforded a VA examination of his PTSD in November 2022. During this examination, the Veteran reported that he was retired and engaged in numerous hobbies. See November 2022 C&P Exam at 6. The examiner expressly stated that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not at that time interfere with employability. Id. The examiner noted that at the time of the examination, the Veteran met the full criteria for PTSD for the first time, and that this represented a progression or worsening. Id.  

A few months prior, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination of his PSD in September 2022. At this examination, the Veteran stated that he had not worked since 1972, after being in a motorcycle accident that caused extensive injuries and a period of hospitalization. See September 2022 C&P Exam at 5. The Veteran stated that he was hit by a drunk driver. Id. The Veteran denied feeling down or depressed but endorsed poor sleep. Id at 5. The examiner identified symptoms of anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, and difficulty adapting to stressful environments. Id at 7.

The Veteran was also afforded two VA examinations of his headache condition during the period of appeal. In September 2023, the Veteran's headache condition resulted in negative ability to attend a job, together with poor performance and concentration. See September 2023 C&P Exam at 4. The Veteran reported prostrating headache attacks greater than once per month. Id at 3-4. At his August 2022 headache examination, no specific functional impact was noted, and the examiner checked a box indicating that the Veteran's headache condition does not impact work. Id at 4. No prostrating attacks were noted. Id at 3.

The Board has also reviewed the evidence concerning the Veteran's scar conditions. The Board notes that in February 2023 VA examiner opined that these conditions limit the Veteran to sedentary work. See February 2023 C&P Exam. The evidence regarding the Veteran's scar conditions is otherwise not highly probative to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.

The Board has reviewed records obtained from the Social Security Administration. See February 2023 Medical Treatment Records - Furnished by SSA. These records clarify that many of the Veteran's physical impairments are related to his involvement in the above-referenced post-service motorcycle accident. Id at 71. These records discuss only physical impairments and do not discuss the Veteran's service-connected disabilities at all, and as such, the Board finds that they are not probative to the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU, except to not that these records do not show any evidence of substantial gainful activity or employment during the period of appeal, or at any time since the 1972 motorcycle accident. 

Based on the foregoing, although the Board notes that the Veteran's employment statement and the facts of his past employment are somewhat opaque, the Board finds that the evidence is sufficient to find that the Veteran has not worked in substantially gainful capacity during the period of appeal. See Lyncnh, supra. Specifically, the Board notes the Veteran's clear articulation on his second VA 21-8940 that he had earned $0.00 in the last 12 months; and the lack of any concrete, contradictory evidence in the record, to include in his social security administration records. The Board notes the Veteran's 2010 report of self-employment for treatment purposes; however, absent evidence that this self-employment continued into the period of appeal (which the Board observes to be more than a decade later), finds it non-probative and irrelevant, as a it would be pure speculation on the part of the Board to assume against the Veteran's later statement that such work continued into the period of appeal. See Beaty, supra.

The Board further finds that from the date of the Veteran's December 2023 VA examination for PTSD, the Veteran's PTSD has rendered him unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment. Specifically, the Board observes that the Veteran reported an inclination to angry outbursts such as throwing his phone; difficulty remembering important information such as memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name; and an inability, not just difficulty, establishing and maintaining work and social relationships. Noting that there is no contradictory evidence of record from December 12, 2023 (the date of the examination), the Board finds that the evidence contained within this examination report is sufficient to establish that the Veteran's PTSD alone rendered him unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment from that date.

Prior to December 12, 2023, the Board notes that the Veteran's PTSD manifested as less severe symptoms, as prior PTSD examinations did not show an inability to establish and maintain relationships, nor the same degree of impaired memory. While the evidence does appear to show that the Veteran stopped working due to other disabilities at some time prior to this, the Board finds that December 12, 2023, is the earliest that the probative evidence of record shows that any of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities were severe enough to preclude substantially gainful employment by themselves. 

The Board has considered whether the Veteran's headaches combined with his PTSD rendered him unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment from the date the evidence shows his headache condition worsened and entitled him to a 50 percent evaluation. However, because the evidence discussed above shows that during this time the Veteran's PTSD symptoms were substantially less severe, the Board finds that such an evaluation is not warranted. The Board also finds that referral of the Veteran's claim to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular TDIU consideration pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b) for the period prior to March 22, 2022, is not indicated. Specifically, the Board notes that prior to March 22, 2022, there is no indication that the Veteran's scar and muscle injuries alone rendered him unemployable, as there is express evidence of record opining that these conditions did not preclude the Veteran from sedentary work. Thus, the evidence is not sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities prior to March 22, 2022. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

Based on the foregoing and resolving any remaining reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU is granted from December 12, 2023, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits. To the extent this grant is not a grant in full of the benefits sought, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU prior to December 12, 2023, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

In closing, the Board notes its cognizance of the Veteran's inclusion of covid or covid-like respiratory symptoms as a reason he cannot work. As no such symptoms appear from the record to arise from a service-connected condition, the Board has not considered these symptoms in adjudicating this claim and has based its decision solely on the evidence of worsening of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and respiratory failure in April 2024. See May 2024 CAPRI at 9. The Board also notes that the Veteran may be eligible for the presumption of exposure to herbicides in the Republic of Vietnam. To the extent the Veteran believes his COPD may be related to toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) such as his likely presumed exposure to herbicides, he is encouraged to file a claim for entitlement to service connection, and, if he does so, to point out that the AOJ's June 2023 finding that the Veteran was not exposed to herbicides is contradicted by the Veteran's DD214 and military personnel file, which show service in the Republic of Vietnam and combat injuries sustained there. Compare June 2023 other with April 2024 Military Personnel Record at 8-9 and May 1969 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. The Board cannot consider such an initial claim for service connection in the first instance, and in by its inclusion of this note makes no findings and expresses no opinion regarding such a claim.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
