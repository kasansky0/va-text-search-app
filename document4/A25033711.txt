ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for back pain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for emotional temperament is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is not shown by the medical evidence of record to have current hearing loss of either ear, according to VA standards.

2. The most probative evidence of record does not show tinnitus to be etiologically related to a disease, injury, or event in service.

3. The most probative evidence of record does not show back pain to be etiologically related to a disease, injury, or event in service.

4. The most probative evidence of record does not show emotional temperament to be etiologically related to a disease, injury, or event in service or to service-connected disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have not been met.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for back pain have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for emotional temperament have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2002 to November 2006.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (the Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits.  In an October 18, 2023, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claims.  He requested higher-level review, and a March 2004 higher-level review decision continued to deny the claim. 

On September 21, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the October 2023 denial of these claims.  He requested the "Direct Review" lane, indicating that he did not want a Board hearing and would not submit any additional evidence in support of the appeal.  In an October 2, 2024, letter, the Board acknowledged the Veteran's appeal request and informed him that the appeal had been placed on the Direct Review docket.

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's Direct Review docket, the Board only may consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., as of the October 18, 2023, rating decision).  38 U.S.C. § 7113 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Moreover, the Board is bound by any favorable findings in the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The Board notes that additional medical records pertinent to the claims on appeal have not been associated with the claims file since the October 2023 rating decision.  If the Veteran has new evidence that he wishes to submit, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim . . . before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief . . . [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section ...."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice).  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claims in this appeal were submitted in April 2023, but on the September 2019 version of VA Form 21-526EZ.  However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error.

In Bowen, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity.  Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  The October 2023 notification letter informing the Veteran of the rating decision included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board.  Additionally, in the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran instead selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing.  Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level.  See Bowen.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed all evidence in the claims file.  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims, and the Board's reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  The Veteran must not assume the Board has overlooked evidence not explicitly discussed herein.  

With regard to the duty to assist, the Veteran reported in his April 2023 claim that he had undergone several x-rays and MRIs for his back, and that he had seen several counselors for years because of the person he became during and after his service.  He also submitted various documents entitled "Explanation of Benefits", some of which referenced treatment at New Day Counseling.  Notably, however, the Veteran did not submit any release forms that would allow VA to obtain these private treatment records, nor did he request that VA obtain these private treatment records.  Therefore, the Board finds that the duty to assist has been met with this regard.  (As noted above, if the Veteran has new evidence that he wishes to submit, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.)

The Veteran has not raised any issues not addressed herein, to include regarding the duty to notify or the duty to assist, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.

The Board also notes, that in August 2022, the SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 ("PACT Act") was passed.  Under the PACT Act, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical nexus opinion when a Veteran submits a compensation claim and has evidence of a disability and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a) (see PACT Act, Sec. 303).  In this case, a May 2023 VA Memorandum noted that the Veteran participated in a TERA for purposes of the provision above.  However, as there is no competent evidence of a current disability related to the Veteran's hearing loss claim, the Board has no basis upon which to order a remand for medical examination/opinion related to this claim.

With regard to the Veteran's tinnitus claim, the Board notes that the Veteran underwent a VA examination, and a pertinent medical opinion was provided in accordance with the PACT Act in July 2023.  As such, no further medical examination/opinion is required with regard to this claim. 

With regard to the Veteran's back pain claim, in VA's sub-regulatory guidance, an exception to the above applies for claims based on physical trauma.  VBA Letter 20-24-06, Exception to TERA Examination and Medical Opinion Requirement at page 12 (June 12, 2024).  Therefore, the Board has no basis under the PACT Act upon which to order a medical examination/opinion related to the Veteran's back pain claim, as he asserts that this condition is due to physical trauma in service.

With regard to the Veteran's emotional temperament claim, subsection (a) does not apply if the VA determines there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by the Veteran and the TERA for which the Veteran submitted evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 1168 (b).  In VA's sub-regulatory guidance, one of the situations in which the exception applies is for a mental health disorder.  VBA Letter 20-22-10, Exception to TERA Examination and Medical Opinion Requirement at page 12 (June 12, 2024).  Accordingly, the Board has no basis under the PACT Act upon which to order a medical examination/opinion related to the Veteran's emotional temperament claim.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110 (West 2002). That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Further, where the Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for a chronic disease but there is insufficient evidence of a diagnosis in service, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303 (b) by demonstrating a continuity of symptomatology since service or diagnosis within the presumptive period after service, but only if the chronic disease is listed under 38 C.F.R. § § 3.309 (a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. § § 3.307 (service connection authorized for chronic diseases diagnosed within the presumptive period).  As arthritis and organic diseases of the nervous system, such as hearing loss, are each a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § § 3.309 (a), the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303 (b) pertaining to continuity of symptomatology and of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 pertaining to presumptive service connection for chronic disease apply to the Veteran's hearing loss and back disability claims.

With respect to hearing loss, VA has specifically defined what is meant by a "disability" for the purposes of service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  "[I]mpaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent."

1. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.

The threshold requirement for service connection to be granted is competent medical evidence of the current existence of the claimed disorder.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  While the Board recognizes the Veteran's sincere belief in his claim, the competent medical evidence of record does not show the Veteran has current hearing loss of either ear, according to VA standards.  Specifically, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023.  Upon examination, his speech recognition scores were recorded using the Maryland CNC test at 100 percent bilaterally.  The auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz was not recorded at 40 decibels or greater in either ear.  Furthermore, the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz were not recorded at 26 decibels or greater for either ear.  As such, the VA criteria for hearing loss was not met at this examination.

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted an April 2023 private audiogram from HearingLife.  These audiogram results were included in graph format.  The Court has held that interpretation of a graphical audiogram is a finding of fact, to be made by the Board in the first instance.  Kelly v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 471 (1995).  If the Board is unable to interpret the graphical audiogram due to unclear results or several possible interpretations, then the Board must remand the results for translation by an appropriate specialist.  Savage v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 259, 270 (2011); see Kelly, 7 Vet. App. at 471.

In this case, the Board is able to interpret the graphical audiogram and notes that the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz was not recorded at 40 decibels or greater in either ear.  Furthermore, the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz were not recorded at 26 decibels or greater for either ear.  Speech recognition scores were not recorded using the Maryland CNC test.  As such, the VA criteria for hearing loss were not demonstrated in this audiogram.

The claims file contains no other medical evidence reflecting that the Veteran currently meets the criteria for hearing loss of either ear according to VA standards.  Thus, without a current diagnosis according to VA standards, there may be no service connection for this claimed disability on a direct or a presumptive basis.

The Board has considered the Veteran's contention that he has hearing loss related to his service.  However, he is not competent to diagnose himself with hearing loss according to VA standards or to provide a link between such a diagnosis and active service, as he has no medical knowledge, training, or expertise.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  As such, his statements to that effect are accorded with little probative value.

In summary, for the reasons stated above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for hearing loss of either ear, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application.

2.  Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for tinnitus.

A review of his service treatment records reveals no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to tinnitus.

In July 2023, the Veteran underwent a VA examination, at which he was diagnosed with tinnitus.  The Veteran reported an onset of about 9 to 10 years prior with no specific date or circumstance identified.  He reported that his tinnitus was initially off and on but is now nearly constant.  The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure.  With a report of gradual onset of intermittent head noise about 10 years ago (which is about 10 years after separation from active duty), hearing within normal limits during time of active duty, no worsening of pure tone sensitivity during time of active duty, and without documentation of complaint of tinnitus during time of active duty or within a year of military separation, it is not likely that the tinnitus is related to active duty noise exposure.  Auditory symptoms related to exposures, whether toxic chemical or noise, or a synergistic effect of both, will manifest within a year of the time of exposure.  It is not likely, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran, that his tinnitus is caused by toxic exposure risk activities. 

Regulations provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  In this case, there is currently no medical evidence of record showing evidence of tinnitus in service.  Moreover, the July 2023 VA medical opinion specifically did not link the Veteran's current tinnitus to his service.  There is no medical evidence to the contrary. 

In his April 2023 claim, the Veteran asserted that he operated loud machinery in service, which started ringing in his ears.  He reported that firing weapons and flying in aircrafts, even with ear protection, started ringing in his ears.  He also asserted that firing howitzers caused ringing in his ears.  The Board has considered the Veteran's contentions that he has tinnitus related to service.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to make such a connection, as he has no medical training or expertise.  Jandreau, supra.  As such, the Veteran's opinion is afforded little weight in the analysis of whether a nexus between his tinnitus and his service exists.

By contrast, the medical professional who provided the July 2023 VA opinion reviewed the Veteran's claims file, examined the Veteran, and offered an opinion with supporting explanations as to why, in her medical judgment, the Veteran's tinnitus is not related to service.  As such, the Board places the most significant weight on the July 2023 medical opinion, which find against service connection.  Thus, the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus must fail on a direct basis.  See Shedden, supra.

In summary, for the reasons stated above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for tinnitus, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application.

3.  Entitlement to service connection for back pain is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for emotional temperament is denied.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for back pain and emotional temperament.

A review of his service treatment records reveals no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to back pain or emotional temperament.

Post-service medical evidence reveals that the Veteran has complained of back pain and reported that he had been seen by a civilian physician for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Specifically, in a November 2016 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported that he recently ran out of his PTSD medications.  He reported that he was previously being seen by a civilian physician, and that his PTSD had been getting worse with rage alternating with depression.  He also submitted an Explanation of Benefits from LineCo indicating that he has sought treatment at New Day Counseling. 

With regard to his back pain, the Veteran sought urgent care at VA in February 2014, at which he reported low back pain intermittently for a few years.  He reported that he had MRIs showing degenerative joint disease and a bulging disc in 2012.

Regulations provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. In this case, there is no indication of complaints related to back pain or an emotional temperament in service, and there is currently no medical evidence of record relating a current back disability or current emotional or psychiatric disability to service.  

In his April 2023 claim, the Veteran asserted that his emotional temperament is related to stress from boot camp and leadership at units, as well as the requirements to function and operate as a Marine on a daily basis.  He also asserted in this claim that he has prolonged back issues due to the longevity of hikes with 80-120-pound packs for 3 to 20 miles at a time.  He asserted that heavily required physical training requirements, hard impact running, and lifting heavy objects caused prolonged back damage.  While the Board has considered the Veteran's contentions that he has back and psychiatric disabilities related to service, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to make such connections, as he has no medical training or expertise.  Jandreau, supra.  As such, the Veteran's opinion is afforded little weight in the analysis of whether a nexus between a back or psychiatric disability and his service exists.

Therefore, as there is no medical evidence documenting back or psychiatric complaints in service, no medical evidence linking a current back or psychiatric disability to service, and the Veteran is not competent to link these claimed disabilities to service, service connection for back pain and an emotional temperament must fail on a direct basis.  See Shedden, supra.

The Board notes that there is no competent or credible evidence of record reflecting that the Veteran demonstrated arthritis of the back to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from active duty.  As such, service connection for back arthritis cannot be granted on a presumptive basis.

With regard to the issue of continuity of symptomatology for his claimed back disability under 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303 (b), spine clinical evaluation was noted as normal at the October 2006 Report of Medical Examination upon separation from service.  Moreover, the Veteran denied recurrent back pain or any back problem on his September 2006 Report of Medical History upon separation from service.  Therefore, the Board finds any lay assertions that the Veteran has experienced back problems since service are not sufficient to demonstrate a continuity of symptomatology for a back disability since service.   

In summary, for the reasons stated above, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the claims for service connection for back pain and emotional temperament, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
