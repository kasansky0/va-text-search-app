ORDER

An earlier effective date of January 11, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for major depressive disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On January 11, 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File and Claim for Compensation and/or Pension Benefits, or Survivors Pensions, and/or DIC (Intent to File). 

2. On June 22, 2022, within one year of the filing of the VA Form 21-0966, VA received a complete VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application (Supplemental Claim), claiming service connection for major depressive disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of January 11, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had active service from September 1974 to December 1988. 

On January 11, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File.  On June 22, 2022, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim, claiming service connection for major depressive disorder.  

A July 2022 VA Regional Office (RO) rating decision granted service connection for major depressive disorder, effective June 22, 2022, and established an initial disability rating of 100 percent. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 2022 VA RO rating decision, explicitly requesting an earlier effective date for service connection for major depressive disorder.  In July 2023, the VA RO issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2022 VA RO rating decision and denied an earlier effective date for service connection for major depressive disorder. 

On July 10, 2024, the Veteran submitted a new HLR request.  On July 22, 2024, the Veteran submitted a letter that sought to withdraw the July 2024 HLR request.  The Veteran also submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket. 

The Veteran may properly withdraw a request for HLR at any time before VA renders a decision on the claim.  The Veteran submitted the letter withdrawing the HLR request in July 2024, and the withdrawal was effective the date VA received the letter.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500.  

Although there is a prohibition on concurrent elections under VA claims processing rules, such as a HLR request and a Notice of Disagreement, the Board finds that the prohibition is not implicated in this case because the Veteran properly withdrew the HLR request before filing the Notice of Disagreement.  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial VA RO decision on a claim, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request). 

Given the election of the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 VA RO rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the VA RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

An Earlier Effective Date of January 11, 2022 for Service Connection for Major Depressive Disorder is Granted.

The Veteran appeals for an earlier effective date of January 11, 2022, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder.  The Veteran contends that there was a properly filed Intent to File on January 11, 2022, and that a complete Supplemental Claim for service connection for major depressive disorder was filed within one year of the Intent to File. 

As to what constitutes a claim, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" means a communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

In this case, review of the record shows that on January 11, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File) from the Veteran.  On June 22, 2022, within one year of receipt of the January 11, 2022, Intent to File, VA received a formal Supplemental Claim Application, in which the Veteran claimed service connection for major depressive disorder.  In a July 2022 VA RO rating decision, the VA RO granted service connection for major depressive disorder, effective June 22, 2022, and established a 100 percent disability rating.  The Veteran continuously pursed the appeal for earlier effective date, with a timely HLR request and subsequent timely Notice of Disagreement. 

Given a review of the record, the Board finds that the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder is January 11, 2022, the date of the VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File).  

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates for an increased disability rating is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by such legal authority.  In this case, the controlling regulation clearly and specifically provides for an effective date no earlier than the date of receipt of the VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File).  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

On these facts, the earliest effective date legally possible under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 is the date of receipt of the VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File); therefore, the appeal for an earlier effective date is granted effective January 11, 2022, but no earlier.
