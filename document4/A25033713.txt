ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for unspecified depressive disorder (claimed as mental disorder, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), insomnia) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a June 2024 decision, prior to the Veteran's July 2024 appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for both lumbosacral strain and unspecified depressive disorder (claimed as mental disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for lumbosacral strain must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

2. The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for unspecified depressive disorder (claimed as mental disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia) must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

In March 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision, which denied service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for lumbosacral strain and a mental disorder claimed variously as depression, anxiety, PTSD, and insomnia.  In June 2024, the AOJ issued an HLR decision that granted service connection for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 17 for both lumbosacral strain and unspecified depressive disorder (claimed as mental disorder, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia).

In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), which initiated this matter before the Board, the appellant expressed disagreement with the denials of service connection for lumbosacral strain and a mental disorder in the October 2023 AOJ decision.

However, given the AOJ's grant of the appellant's claims for service connection in the June 2024 HLR decision, there no question for appellate consideration by the Board, and the appeal must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.
