ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation at the R-2 level, for accrued purposes is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Pursuant to SMC(l), the Veteran required regular aid and attendance of another person due to the functional limitations of his service-connected disabilities; however, additional compensation under SMC(r)(1) and SMC(r)(2) is precluded because the Veteran did not meet the threshold requirement for consideration.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for special monthly compensation at the R-2 level, for accrued purposes have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (r)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.351, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from July 1969 to February 1971. He died in August 2023. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

The appellant's claim was initially denied in a rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in October 2023.

In November 2023, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2023 decision. In December 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to special monthly compensation at the R-2 level, for accrued purposes

The appellant contends that a higher level of special monthly compensation (SMC) is warranted due to the level of care required by the Veteran leading up to his death.

SMC is available when, as the result of a service-connected disability, a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by the schedule for rating disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352. The rate of SMC varies according to the nature of the veteran's service-connected disabilities.

As of the date of this decision, SMC has already been granted at the following rates:

SMC-K under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) and 38 C.F. R. § 3.350(a) on account of anatomical loss of a creative organ from March 30, 2007, to August 6, 2023.

SMC-L under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(1) and 38 C.F. R. § 3.350(b) on account of being so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance from September 2, 2020, to August 6, 2023.

In this case, the Appellant contends that SMC is warranted at the increased (r)(2) level due to the Veteran receiving home hospice care beginning in March 2023, until the date of his passing at an inpatient hospice facility in August 2023.

SMC(r)(1) is assigned when there is a factual need for special aid and attendance and SMC(r)(2) is assigned when there is a factual need for a higher level of special aid and attendance; as a threshold matter for SMC(r)(1) and SMC(r)(2), the Veteran must be entitled to SMC(o), at the maximum rate authorized under SMC(p), or at the intermediate rate authorized between the rates authorized under SMC(n) and SMC(o) and at the rate authorized under SMC(k). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(k), 1114(n), 1114(o), 1114(p), 1114(r). 

After meeting that threshold requirement, SMC(r)(1) is warranted when the evidence additionally shows that the Veteran is also entitled to aid and attendance on a factual basis and SMC(r)(2) is warranted when the evidence shows that the Veteran needs not only aid and attendance, but a higher level of care (daily care by a licensed professional or someone under the supervision of a licensed professional such that, in the absence of such care, the Veteran would be an inpatient or resident at a hospital or nursing home). Id.

The initial question for the Board is whether the Veteran met the threshold requirements for SMC at the rate authorized under subsection (r).

SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(n) (SMC-N) is payable where there is anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at a level or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place; anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; anatomical loss of one arm so near the shoulder as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance with anatomical loss of one leg so near the hip as to prevent use of a prosthetic appliance; or anatomical loss of both eyes or blindness without light perception in both eyes. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(n); 38 C.F. R. §§ 3.350(d).

SMC-O is warranted if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered disability under conditions which would entitle such veteran to two or more of the rates provided in one or more subsections (l) through (n), with no condition being considered twice in the determination. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(o); 38 C.F. R. § 3.350(e).

The provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p) provide for "intermediate" SMC rates between the different subsections based on anatomical loss or loss of use of the extremities or blindness in connection with deafness and/or loss or loss of use of a hand or foot. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f). In addition to the statutory rates payable under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) through (n) and the intermediate or next-higher rate provisions set forth under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p), an additional single permanent disability independently ratable at 100 percent apart from any consideration of individual unemployability will afford entitlement to the next-higher statutory rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 or if already entitled to an intermediate rate to the next higher intermediate rate, but in no event higher than the "o" rate. The single permanent disability independently ratable at 100 percent must be separate and distinct and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems from the conditions establishing entitlement under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) through (n) or the intermediate rate provisions outlined above. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(4).

In this case, the Board finds that additional compensation is not warranted under SMC(r)(1) or SMC(r)(2) because did not require special aid and attendance or a higher level of special aid and attendance as contemplated by governing regulation.

First, the Veteran does not meet the threshold requirement for consideration because: (a) he was not entitled to SMC(o) because he was not entitled to two or more of the rates among SMC(l), SMC(m), and SMC(n) (although the Veteran is already in receipt of SMC(l), he was not entitled to SMC(m) or SMC(n) because there was no anatomical loss of use or blindness as the result of service-connected disabilities), nor had he suffered deafness, blindness, or loss of use as the result of service-connected disabilities. 

Second, he was not at the maximum rate authorized under SMC(p) (according to the December 2023 Codesheet, the Veteran has not been granted SMC(p)). 

Third, while the Veteran was in receipt of SMC(k) for loss of use of a creative organ, he was not at the intermediate rate authorized between the rates under SMC(n) and SMC(o) (as discussed above, the Veteran is not entitled to SMC(n) or SMC(o). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(k), 1114(n), 1114(o), 1114(p), 1114(r).

Thus, because the Veteran did not meet the threshold requirement for consideration, additional compensation under SMC(r)(1) and SMC(r)(2) is precluded and the appellant's claim must be denied.
