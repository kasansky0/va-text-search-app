DATE:  April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence for the period on appeal prior to August 10, 2022, is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served at Ubon and Korat Royal Thai Air Force Bases (RTAFB), Thailand, and his duties placed him on or near the perimeter of the base; therefore, his herbicide exposure is conceded on a facts-found basis.

2. The Veteran's prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence is presumptively related to his exposure to herbicides during his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1116, 1131, 5107 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from July 1963 to July 1966. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a January 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Initially, this appeal was under the Legacy review system. However, following the issuance of a December 2023 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC), the Veteran opted to have the appeal reviewed under the modernized review system with the January 2024 submission of a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR. The January 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal was issued in response to that request. 

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 SSOC, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the December 2023 SSOC, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801 (2024). 

By way of history, in a March 2022 decision, the Board denied entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer. The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In a February 2023 Order, the Court granted a Joint Motion of the parties, vacated the Board's March 2022 decision, and returned the case to the Board for action consistent with the Joint Motion. In a May 2023 decision, the Board granted entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence pursuant to the passage of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), and remanded entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer prior to passage of the PACT Act for additional consideration. 

In a June 2023 rating decision, the Board's grant of benefits was effectuated, and the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence, effective August 10, 2022. In the December 2023 SSOC identified above, the Veteran was denied entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence on bases other than the pursuant to the PACT Act. Put another way, the Veteran was essentially denied entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and importance prior to August 10, 2022. As discussed above, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system and this appeal stems from the HLR of the December 2023 SSOC.

Service Connection - Prostate Cancer

The Veteran contends that his prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence is related to his active service, to include exposure to herbicides as a result of his service in Thailand. The question for the Board's consideration is whether entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer irrespective of the PACT Act.

A review of the record shows that the Veteran has reported that while station in Thailand, specifically at Ubon and Korat RTAFBs, he consistently passed through the perimeter in the performance of his service-related duties. He explained that when he was tasked with disassembling fighter jets, building roads, and other duties, he was exposed to herbicides sprayed on and in surrounding areas of the air base, to include base camps Camp Cobra and Camp Surgwien. He added that the base entrance/gate was located on the perimeter. Further, he recalled that he was transported on the same plane as servicemembers who were exposed to herbicides while serving in the Republic of Vietnam.

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded that the Veteran served at Ubon and Korat RTAFBs. Additionally, the AOJ found that the Veteran has currently present prostate cancer that manifested to a compensable degree. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c) (2024). Further, the Board notes that prostate cancer is a disease associated with herbicide exposure under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). 

Although the AOJ was unable to verify that the Veteran served on the perimeter of the RTAFBs, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to report what he experienced or observed. Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran's accounts to be credible. Therefore, the Board concedes that the Veteran's service duties placed him on or near the perimeter while serving in Thailand and hence, he was exposed to herbicides on a facts-found basis. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim is, at least, in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer with incontinence and impotence irrespective of the application of the PACT Act is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
