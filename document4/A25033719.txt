ORDER

Service connection for a left knee disability is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for right knee, bilateral hip and lower back conditions is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's current left knee disability was incurred during verified combat service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§1110, 1154(b), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1969 to June 1971, including combat service in Vietnam.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a right knee disability, bilateral hip condition, and lower back condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. §3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38?U.S.C. §§1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §3.303.

For any Veteran who engaged in combat with the enemy in active service of the United States during a period of war, campaign, or expedition, VA shall accept as sufficient proof of service connection of any disease or injury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by that service satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of that injury or disease, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of that incurrence or aggravation in such service.  VA shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran.  Service connection of that injury or disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. §1154(b); see also Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (under 38 U.S.C. §1154(b), a combat veteran's assertions of an event during combat are to be presumed if consistent with the time, place, and circumstances of such service).

In Maxson v. Gober, the Federal Circuit stated that the combat presumption is an "evidentiary mechanism [that] involves a three-step analysis." 230 F.3d 1330, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The first two steps require (1) determining "whether the veteran has presented 'satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease'" and (2) determining "whether the evidence is 'consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.'"  Id. at 1323-33 (quoting 38 U.S.C. §1154(b)).  The Federal Circuit established that, "[i]f these two steps are met, the Secretary shall accept the evidence as 'sufficient proof of service-connection,' regardless of the absence of official records."  Id. at 1333 (quoting 38 U.S.C. §1154(b)). The third step then requires an analysis of whether service connection "may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary." 38 U.S.C. §1154(b); Maxson, 230 F.3d at 1333.

The combat presumption not only allows the occurrence of both the "cause" of a disability, but the "disability itself." See Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 998-9 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("In short, although the record contained evidence of the cause of Reeves' disability... he still had the right to invoke the section 1154(b) presumption in order to show that he incurred the disability itself while in service.") (citing Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67).

The combat presumption reduces for veterans who have engaged in combat the burden of presenting evidence of incurrence of an injury in service but does not eliminate the nexus requirement. Collette, 82 F.3d at 392.  The Veteran must show that the disability he incurred in service was a chronic condition that persisted in the years following his active duty.  Reeves, 682 F.3d. at 988.

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  It is the Board's principal responsibility to assess the credibility, and therefore the probative value of the evidence of record in its entirety. Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429 (1995); Elkins v. Gober, 229 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Guimond v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 69 (1993); Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).  In determining whether evidence submitted by a Veteran is credible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other information submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Board is not required to accept a veteran's uncorroborated account of active service experiences. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).

Service connection for a left knee disability

Turning to the instant case, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for a left knee disability (mild patellofemoral and lateral femorotibial arthrosis). 38 CFR § 3.104(c). After a thorough review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran credibly and competently reports that his disability was incurred in service. See Layno v. Brown 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). 

Specifically, the Veteran contends, "Numerous impact and environmental conditions have caused me debilitating hip and other joint pain beginning while still in the service." See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation); Furthermore, the Veteran is in receipt of an Army combat infantryman badge as well as an Army Commendation Medal, service in the Republic of Vietnam, for meritorious achievement in connection with military operations against a hostile force. See July 5, 1970 Military Personnel Record; September 7, 1970 Military Personnel Record. The Board finds that the Veteran's engagement in combat corroborates his account that he experienced "numerous environment and impact" events. 

Of note, from the very month that the Veteran left active duty service, (June 1971) he claimed that he acquired a "leg" disability in service which continued to bother him after service. See June 1971 VA Form 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension. VA medical treatment records show that the Veteran has experienced the deleterious effects of left knee disability since service, having had arthroscopic surgery of both knees and taking regular medication for pain. See Veterans Affairs Medical Center Treatment Records, Northport, NY, received by VA in September 2023.

The Board finds no clear and convincing evidence to contradict the Veteran's assertion of in-service incurrence of a current left knee disability. See Maxson, 230 F.3d at 1333. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). In addition, the Board finds that the persistent nature of the condition demonstrated in the record since 1971 is sufficient to support a nexus to service. Accordingly, the Board therefore finds the Veteran is entitled to service connection for a left knee disability. His appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for right knee, bilateral hip and lower back conditions

As mentioned above, the Veteran contends on his August 2023 claim for compensation that, "Numerous impact and environmental conditions have caused me debilitating hip and other joint pain beginning while still in the service."  Additionally, on his August 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran contends that his "claim was not just for knees, claim was for all joints a[ff]ected by arthritis and spine."

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board notes that the AOJ did not provide the Veteran with VA medical examinations and/or medical opinions addressing the nature and etiology of any left knee, bilateral hip, or spine disabilities. VA must provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim of service connection when the record contains competent lay or medical evidence of (1) a current diagnosed disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; (2) evidence establishing that the veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in-service; (3) an indication that the claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease in-service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence for VA to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. §5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c)(4). 

The threshold for finding that the disability may be associated with service is low. Id. A Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms and history, including the onset and timing of symptoms, and such reports must be considered. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further, as emphasized in Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021), VA has a general practice of identifying and adjudicating issues and claims that logically relate to and arise in connection with a claim pending before VA. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57672 (Sep. 25, 2014); Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 103, 107 (2022).

It is unclear to the Board how the Veteran's claim for "debilitating hip and other joint pain beginning while in service" came to be characterized by the AOJ as "joint disease (claimed as right and left knee)." A review of the Veteran's records reveals several indications that the Veteran was claiming entitlement to service connection for more than just a right knee disability.

Right knee condition

As a reminder, the Veteran claimed in August 2023 that his disabilities began "while still in the service." In his initial June 1971 claim for compensation the Veteran reported that he had been treated for a "leg" condition. A July 27, 1971 VA examination mentioned that the Veteran reported problems with his right knee. These facts tend to support the credibility of the Veteran's claim that his right knee disability began in service.  In his August 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran said his "claim was not just for knees," indicating he was seeking service connection for both knees. 

The following are examples of VA treatment records showing the Veteran may have a right knee disability.  On June 5, 2023 the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain and swelling. On that same date it is noted "Crepitus of the right and left knees is present." On July 5, 2023 it was noted that the Veteran had bilateral knee surgery about ten years prior and was currently having difficulty ascending and descending stairs, bending and squatting. On that same date it is noted that "2[Two]views of the right knee show tricompartmental osteoarthritic changes." On August 22, 2023 it is noted that the Veteran had undergone bilateral arthroscopic surgeries of right knee in 2008.

Taken together with the Veteran's statements, at the time the AOJ issued its rating decision on appeal there was a reasonable possibility that the Veteran had a left knee disability that was incurred in service. Therefore, there was a duty to assist error when the AOJ did not request an examination and opinion for this matter. Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is required to obtain a VA examination and opinion. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006).

Bilateral hip condition

In an October 1976 VA Form 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, the Veteran reported, "In the last two years I have been treated in the VA Hospital ... for pain & stiffness in the [right] leg and hip, with medication, caused to miss work ... the condition has grown increasingly worse." The AOJ did not adjudicate that claim, determining that it was untimely filed, and that no new and material evidence had been submitted to warrant reopening the claim. See January 1977 Deferred Rating Decision. 

As a reminder, the Veteran's August 2023 claim for compensation reported, "debilitating hip and other joint pain beginning while still in the service." Subsequent VA medical treatment records show that the Veteran experienced hip pain and had left hip replacement surgery, aching pain and stiffness in his right and left hips, and right hip pain that is worsened with activity. See, e.g. June 20, 2023 VA Treatment Record; August 30, 2023 VA Treatment Record. The Board finds that these facts meet the low threshold articulated in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006). Therefore, there was a duty to assist error when the AOJ did not request an examination and opinion for this matter. Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is required to obtain a VA examination and opinion.

Lower back condition

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a lower back disability. He is currently diagnosed with See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement. Although the Veteran did not specifically mention the lower back when he filed his August 2023 claim, he did contend he was seeking service connection for "other joint pain beginning while in service." In a March 06, 2020 VA treatment record it is noted that the Veteran had a history of lower back pain, and imaging produced an impression of "[m]ild sclerosis of the left sacroiliac joint."  In a June 20, 2023 VA treatment record it is noted that the Veteran complained of lower back pain. On the same date, it is noted that the Veteran's lower back pain is "associated with variable stiffness especially in the morning and after prolonged standing." Together with the veteran's contentions, the Board finds that these records show that the issue of a lower back disability was raised by the record before the AOJ at the time it issued the rating decision on appeal. As such, the Board finds that these facts meet the low threshold articulated in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006) Therefore, there was a duty to assist error when the AOJ did not request an examination and opinion for this matter. Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is required to obtain a VA examination and opinion. 

 The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA Examination with an appropriate clinician(s) to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left knee condition, bilateral hip condition and lower back condition. 

The clinician must address the following: 

(A)	Determine a current diagnosis of each affected joint.

(B)	Each clinician must address whether it is at least as likely as not (the favorable and unfavorable evidence of record is in approximate balance or is nearly equal) that the Veteran's disability is due to his service, to include injury or injuries sustained in combat.

The clinician is asked to explain the reasons behind all opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.  Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding. The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.
