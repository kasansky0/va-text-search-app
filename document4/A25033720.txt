ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for service-connected hypertension (HTN) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected hypertension did not manifest with at least diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; or, a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more that requires continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a compensable disability rating for service-connected HTN have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from July 1965 to July 1968. 

This matter come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing Docket. The Veteran appeared at a Board hearing before the undersigned in January 2025. A transcript of that hearing is of record. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

When there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for service-connected HTN. 

The Veteran contends a compensable disability rating is warranted for his service-connected hypertension. See Hearing Transcript.

The Veteran's hypertension is rated under DC 7101. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. Under DC 7101, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for hypertensive vascular disease with diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. Id. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for hypertensive vascular disease with diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. Id. A 40 percent disability rating is warranted for hypertensive vascular disease with diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. Id. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted for hypertensive vascular disease with diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. Id. Where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a Diagnostic Code, a zero percent rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Of note, the listed criterion for higher evaluations is successive, meaning that the criteria for a lower evaluation must be met before a higher rating may be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide a definition for the term "predominantly." In the absence of guidance, the Board will consider that term as it is commonly understood. "Predominantly" is defined as "for the most part," or "mainly." See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 978 (11th ed. 2012). In other words, for a compensable rating, the Veteran's blood pressure readings would have to "mainly" or "for the most part" exhibit the criteria for a higher rating. Isolated blood pressure readings meeting the criteria do not qualify for a compensable rating without evidence that the symptoms predominantly meet the relevant criteria. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 274 (2016).

The Board notes that, because the hypertension Diagnostic Code lists "continuous medication for control" as a criterion in the 10 percent rating, the Diagnostic Code, when read as a whole, contemplates the effects of medication in assigning a disability evaluation. McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 272-73.

First, the Board may consider the average readings in either diastolic or systolic pressure. In the alternative, in cases where continuous use of medication to control blood pressure is shown, as is the case here, the Board then may consider whether the average blood pressure readings historically may meet the regulatory threshold for diastolic pressure at 100 or more.

The Board has carefully and thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's medical records and concludes that the evidence is persuasively against finding that his hypertension warrants a compensable rating at any time during the pendency of the appeal. Regarding his diastolic readings, the Veteran had no readings with diastolic pressure over 100 throughout the entirety of the appeal.

Moreover, the records show 14 instances (including five readings on the same day) where his systolic readings were above 160 out of more than 50 readings. Given the length of the period on appeal, the Board finds that systolic readings at 160 or more were not "for the most part" or "mainly," as less than half of the readings were over 160.

Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's diastolic blood pressure was predominately less than 100 and the systolic pressure predominately less than 160. As such, the criteria for a compensable rating have not been met.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran required continuous medication to control his hypertension; however, such is already contemplated by the rating criteria. McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. at 276-77 (finding that the Board may properly consider ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication). Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the use of medication, and the record does not demonstrate the Veteran's systolic blood pressure was 160 or greater, or diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.

To the extent the Veteran asserts that his hypertension warrants a higher rating, the Board notes he is not competent to state that his hypertension warrants a compensable rating because such an opinion requires medical expertise and knowledge that he has not been shown to possess. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). As such, the Board finds the competent evidence of record is persuasively against assignment of a compensable rating for hypertension pursuant to DC 7101. The Board has also considered that a 10 percent disability rating may be warranted for the Veteran's hypertension due to the need for continuous medication. However, as noted above, the governing criteria provide that a 10 percent rating will be assigned for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. Thus, there must be both (1) a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and (2) a need for continuous medication for control to warrant a compensable rating under that provision.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's assertion that he is entitled to an increased rating for hypertension. However, a compensable rating is not warranted. After a review of the medical reports, there is no evidence of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more; and after a very careful review of the post-service treatment records, there is no evidence that the medical history reflected a diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more. The Board is bound by the strict rating criteria and the competent evidence of record has not shown findings consistent with a compensable rating.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim and an initial compensable rating is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
