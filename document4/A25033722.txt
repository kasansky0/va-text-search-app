ORDER

An increased rating of 80 percent, but no higher, for service-connected kidney disease, is granted, subject to the regulations governing the payment of monetary awards. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's kidney disease is manifested as showing estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an 80 percent rating, but no higher, for kidney disease has been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7541.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service from March 1966 to March 1972. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Review docket. 

As the Veteran selected the Evidence Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or their representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the August 29, 2024, VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Finally, the Board notes that it is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) unless a docket switch waiver is provided by the Veteran.  In the present case, the Board mailed a December 2024 letter to the Veteran providing notice of his right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever is later.  Additionally, the Veteran was provided the option to waive the remaining time to select a different Board review option by signing and returning the attached waiver.  VA received the signed waiver on February 21, 2025.  See February 2025 Correspondence.  Thus, the Board may proceed on the adjudication of the claim.  

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for service-connected kidney disease

The Veteran was granted service connection for kidney disease as secondary to his service-connected diabetes mellitus, in the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, which assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) rating, effective March 28, 2023 (date of claim).  The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher rating. 

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.? 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and there must be emphasis upon the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. 

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

When the evidence is in approximate balance in the Veteran's favor or nearly equal regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and a higher initial disability rating is at issue, the level of disability at the time entitlement arose is of primary concern.  Consideration must also be given to a longitudinal picture of the veteran's disability to determine if the assignment of separate ratings for separate periods of time, a practice known as "staged" ratings, is warranted.  Staged ratings are appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified.  See Fenderson v. West,?12?Vet. App.?119?(1999), Hart v. Mansfield,?21?Vet. App.?505?(2007). 

The Veteran's kidney disease is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7541, for renal involvement in diabetes mellitus type I or II, which instructs to rate the disability as renal dysfunction. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, the ratings for renal dysfunction, provide for: a noncompensable rating where there is glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is greater than or equal to 30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  

A 30 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic kidney disease with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  

A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  

An 80 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic kidney disease with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.  

And a 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient.  

A Note appending the renal dysfunction criteria states that GFR, estimated GFR (eGFR), and creatinine-based approximations of GFR will be accepted for evaluation purposes under this section when determined to be appropriate and calculated by a medical professional. 

Turning to the relevant evidence, the Veteran's VA treatment records show treatment for chronic kidney disease as early as April 2014.  A September 2021 addendum noted that the Veteran had been hospitalized for kidney failure.  Additionally, an April 2023 Diabetology Note indicated an eGFR of 28mL/min/1.73 m2.  This was noted to have dropped from 31 mL/min and note was made to continue monitoring the Veteran closely while on empagliflozin.  In an April 2024 nephrology note, it was stated the Veteran had chronic kidney disease stage 3b and was being treated with semaglutide.  His labs from March 18, 2024 were reviewed; they showed a GFR of 30 and his creatine was 2.20.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination; diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed.  The Veteran did not report any current symptoms.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have hypertension or heart disease due to renal dysfunction or caused by any kidney condition.  Additionally, the Veteran did not require regular dialysis or have a cystic, obstructive, or glomerular structural kidney abnormality for at least three consecutive months during the past twelve months.  The Veteran had not had a kidney removed and was not eligible for a transplant.  The VA examiner noted the laboratory studies contained in the evidence of record which showed the Veteran's eGFR at 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 on December 14, 2023, and 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 on March 18, 2024.  The Veteran's creatine was 2.20 and albumin/creatine ratio of 596.

In weighing the medical evidence of record, the Board finds the Veteran's kidney disease more closely approximates an 80 percent disability rating.  VA treatment records show the Veteran has chronic kidney disease with eGFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2.  Additionally, the Board finds the Veteran's eGFR levels are determined to be appropriate and calculated by a medical professional.  The Board acknowledges the provided laboratory tests were not taken over 3 consecutive months as described in the rating criteria; however, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor noting that in April 2023, the Veteran had an eGFR of 28mL, an eGFR of 29 mL in December 2023, and a GFR of 30 mL in March 2024.  These readings are consistent and taken several months apart in a span of almost one calendar year. Thus, the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for an 80 percent rating.? 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

A higher 100 percent rating is not warranted unless there is chronic kidney disease with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient.  Here, the evidence of record does not show laboratory tests with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2 for at least three consecutive months during the past 12 months, nor does the Veteran require routine dialysis or is eligible for a kidney transplant.  Accordingly, the Veteran's kidney disease does not nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 100 percent rating. 

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, an 80 percent rating, but not higher, for service-connected kidney disease is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
