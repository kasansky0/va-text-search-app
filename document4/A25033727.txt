Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with TERA participation is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Effective August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) extended the presumption of exposure to herbicide agents to Veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai Air Force Base (RTAFB) during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, without regard to physical location of the Veteran or what military job specialty the Veteran performed while stationed at the base.

2. The Veteran first filed his claims for service connection for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy on July 7, 2023, and continuously pursued his claims thereafter.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with TERA participation have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114(a), 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with TERA participation have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114(a), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1959 to June 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2025 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Veteran has specifically requested an effective date of August 10, 2022.  See March 2025 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Board is able to grant the specifically requested relief.  Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until February 2026, the end of the period in which to request a docket change.

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, the Board has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

1. Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with TERA participation is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with TERA participation is granted.

The rating decision on appeal granted to the Veteran service connection for his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy associated with Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) participation, assigning a 10 percent rating effective November 7, 2023, based upon the Veteran's submission of an Intent to File (ITF). The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the PACT Act. 

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. §3.400.

Before March 24, 2015, a "claim" was a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p), 3.155. Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by the VA and identifying the benefits sought may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, were: (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009). The benefit sought must be identified, though it need not be specific. Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009). The Veteran does not assert that he filed a formal or informal claim for his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy prior to March 24, 2015. The evidence also does not show that a formal or informal claim for his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was filed prior to March 24, 2015.

The effective date provisions regarding revision of a decision based on a supplemental claim are addressed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a new supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1) within one year of the prior denial. Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182 within one year of the higher-level review decision. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(2). If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) extended the presumption of exposure to herbicide agents to Veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai Air Force Base (RTAFB) during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, without regard to physical location of the Veteran or what military job specialty the Veteran performed while stationed at the base. The PACT Act was enacted effective August 10, 2022. For claims pending on or before the enactment of the PACT Act, the earliest possible effective date for a grant of service connection pursuant to the PACT Act is August 10, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

When compensation is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law, the effective date may be as early as the effective date of the law, if the claim is received within one year of the effective date of the law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

In this case, the Veteran first filed his claims for service connection for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy on July 7, 2023, within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act. Those claims were denied in a November 2023 rating decision and the Veteran was notified of said rating decision in a letter dated November 9, 2023. The Veteran then filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on October 17, 2024, within one year of the denial, from which the rating decision on appeal was rendered. 

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of August 10, 2022, for service connection for his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy conditions. The Veteran filed his initial claim for these conditions in July 2023, within one year of the enactment of the PACT Act, and continuously pursued his claims since that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, 3.2500 (h)(1).

Other theories upon which service connection may be granted were considered, including direct service connection. However, this would not provide an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy as the Veteran's claims were not received prior to August 10, 2022, and there were no prior claims, formal or informal, for his right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy conditions prior to July 7, 2023.

Accordingly, an effective date of August 10, 2022, for service connection for the Veteran's right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § §3.114, 3.400.
