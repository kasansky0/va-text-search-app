ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to an initial 100 percent disability rating for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 17, 2023, for the award of service connection for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma is denied.

Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's hypertension has been manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and required continuous medication, at any point during the appeal period.

2. For the entire period on review, the evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran suffered from pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma; and, underwent surgery and received radiation treatment, antineoplastic chemotherapy, and other therapeutic procedures to treat soft tissue sarcoma.

3. On April 17, 2023, the Veteran's VA Form 21-0966 was received into the record; and, within one year of receipt of the intent to file, the Veteran submitted a valid claim for entitlement to service connection for his pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma.

4. Prior to April 17, 2023, the record does not contain a valid claim for service connection for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma; and the evidence shows entitlement to service connection arose prior to April 17, 2023.

5. The award of a 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma renders the claim for a 10 percent rating based on multiple, noncompensable disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 moot.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

2. The criteria for an initial 100 percent disability rating for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.73, DC 5329.

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than April 17, 2023, for the award of service connection for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.400, 3.2500.

4. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.324.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army on active duty from June 1964 to March 1967.

The issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2024 and August 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective July 2024 and August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the appropriate decisions on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for hearing loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Increased Rating

VA has adopted the Schedule for Rating Disabilities to evaluate service-connected disabilities.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?3.321; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part IV.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38?C.F.R. §?4.10.

The degrees of disabilities are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned diagnostic codes.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various percentage ratings for each disability and the criteria for specific ratings.  However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Where there is a question of which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability assessment more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Additionally, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  In a claim for a greater original rating after an initial award of service connection, all evidence submitted in support of the veteran's claim is to be considered.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  However, consideration must be given as to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Hypertension

The Veteran contends that he suffers from hypertension which warrants an increased disability rating.

Under DC 7101, a rating of 10 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.  A rating of 20 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more; or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  Id.  A rating of 40 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  Id.  A rating of 60 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.  Id.

Further, the Board notes that the plain language of DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016).  Thus, the Board in this case is permitted to consider the ameliorative effects of medication and base the evaluation of the Veteran's disability on the Veteran's actual blood pressure readings, with the limited exception of an initial 10 percent compensable rating.  Id. at 271-72.  A 10 percent evaluation is warranted in three circumstances: first, where diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more; second, where systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or third, as a "minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control."  Id.

As the Court explained in McCarroll, the criteria for compensable evaluations under DC 7101 contemplate two factual alternatives.  First, a veteran whose blood pressure is currently controlled by medication-i.e., whose blood pressure does not otherwise meet the criteria for a compensable evaluation-but who has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more is entitled to receive the minimum compensable evaluation of 10 percent.  Second, a veteran whose blood pressure is currently elevated to varying degrees is entitled to evaluations ranging from 10 percent to 60 percent.  Id.  The Court stated that "these two scenarios clearly contemplate the effects of medication: either a veteran's blood pressure is controlled by medication, warranting a 10 percent evaluation if there is a history of elevated systolic pressure, or it is not, in which case the actual blood pressure level determines the disability rating."  Id.

In Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 79 (2021), the Court held that the plain language of DC 7101 with respect to the 10 percent evaluation criteria-which references "a history of" diastolic pressure over a certain level-required consideration of blood pressure readings prior to when the blood pressure was controlled with medication.  Such "history" must include consideration of blood pressure readings, where available in the evidence of record, prior to the period on appeal.  

At no point did the Court in Wilson call into question its prior holding in McCarroll that DC 7101 expressly contemplated the ameliorative effects of medication, nor did it hold that a Veteran could meet higher disability ratings in excess of 10 percent based on historical pre-medication blood pressure readings years prior to the period on appeal.  See Wilson, supra.  In contrast to the rating criteria for a 10 percent rating, the successive evaluation criteria in DC 7101 do not mention "a history" of such elevated readings; rather, the successive ratings are based upon actual blood pressure readings. 

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's medical records show that he was on medication for hypertension as early as 2012.  During his April 2024 VA hypertension examination, the Veteran reported that he was prescribed daily medication when he was first diagnosed with hypertension around 2012 or 2013.  The Veteran's June 2023 private treatment history notes the Veteran's hypertension required the daily use of two oral medications to treat high blood pressure.

Prior to the time that the Veteran was on medication for hypertension, service treatment records show that at his April 1964 entrance examination, the Veteran had a blood pressure reading of 130/84.  The Veteran's March 1967 separation examination revealed a blood pressure reading of 138/78.  

In April 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) provided the Veteran a VA hypertension examination.  Following a review of all available records and an in-person examination, the VA clinician provided the Veteran a diagnosis of hypertension.  The VA examiner noted the onset of the Veteran's condition was in 2012.  The Veteran reported that he reported feeling flush during a primary care visit where he was found to be hypertensive.  The VA examination noted the Veteran's blood pressure improved since onset.  The VA examination noted the Veteran's symptoms were controlled with daily medication.  The Veteran's blood pressure readings on examination were 120/80; 115/75; and 115/75.  The examination noted the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation of 100 or more.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran did not have any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to his hypertension.  The VA examination reported the Veteran's hypertension did not impact his ability to work.

Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's medical history demonstrates the Veteran was directed to monitor his blood pressure.  However, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Furthermore, while the Veteran has required continuous medication to control his blood pressure, the persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran had a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more prior to when the Veteran began medication to control his blood pressure.  The disability picture does not demonstrate a prevailing history where the "most frequent or common" diastolic pressure was 100 or above.  The evidence of record overall generally depicts the Veteran's hypertension manifested as stable but elevated blood pressure managed through daily oral medication.  The Board finds that the evidence of record at no time during the period under review demonstrates the Veteran's hypertension warranted a compensable disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has experienced some difficulties managing his hypertension while on medication throughout the period on appeal.  The Board notes that DC 7101 identifies use of medication to control hypertension, and accordingly, the Board may consider the ameliorative effects of medication on the Veteran's disability when it is rated.  See McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 271.  The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's elevated blood pressure necessitating daily medication.  However, while the Veteran has required continuous medication to manage hypertensive blood pressure, the overall evidence of record does not support a finding of predominant blood pressure readings or symptoms associated with severe hypertension that warrant an increased disability rating.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively weighs against granting an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's hypertension, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Pleomorphic Leiomyosarcoma

For the period under review, the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma is rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.73, DC 5329-5312.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; with the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  

Diagnostic Code 5329 provides that a soft tissue sarcoma of the muscle fat or fibrous connective tissue will be assigned a 100 percent evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.73, DC 5329.  A rating of 100 percent shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgery, radiation treatment, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedures.  Id.  Six months after the discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination; and if there has been no local recurrence or metastasis, the disability is rated on residual impairment of function.  Id.

Diagnostic Code 5312 provides compensation to injuries affecting Muscle Group XII, which includes the anterior muscles of the leg (1) Tibialis anterior; (2) extensor digitorum longus; (3) extensor hallucis longus; (4) peroneus tertius.  38 C.F.R. § 4.73.  Compensation is based on impairment of function affecting (1) dorsiflexion, (2) extension of toes, and (3) stabilization of arch.  Id.  A noncompensable rating is given to slight impairment; a 10 percent rating is awarded for moderate impairment; a 20 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe impairment; and a 30 percent rating is given for severe impairment of function of the Group XII muscles.  Id.

Following a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the criteria for an initial 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma have been met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.73, DC 5329.

In April 2024, the AOJ provided the Veteran a VA muscle injuries examination.  The examining physician provided the diagnosis of pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma with a date of diagnosis of March 2023.  At the onset of his condition the Veteran reported that he complained of pain in his lower left leg.  The Veteran's sarcoma was confirmed, and the examination noted the condition progressed overtime.  The Veteran reported that his pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma began in his lower leg and metastasized to his right flank, thoracic spine, and into his lungs.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran's history of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.  

The VA examiner noted the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma caused an injury to the Veteran's Group XII muscles of the left leg.  Additionally, the VA examiner noted minimal scarring associated with the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma surgery and treatment.

The Veteran's private medical history shows the Veteran underwent a PET scan and biopsy in March 2023 that identified the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma, noted as stage IV with proven metastatic disease.  The Veteran's private oncology records show the Veteran underwent surgery in May 2023 to remove the mass on the Veteran's left leg.  The Veteran's private medical history reveals the Veteran underwent radiation treatment for the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma and associated metastases prior to and following the Veteran's May 2023 surgery, with medical records showing the most recent course occurred November 2023.  The Veteran's private oncology records show the Veteran underwent a series of antineoplastic chemotherapy and other therapeutic procedures prior to and following the Veteran's May 2023 surgery.  The Veteran's April 2024 private oncology record reveals the Veteran was prescribed pazopanib for treatment of metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma to be taken orally daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Additionally, in January 2025, the Veteran's private oncologist provided a medical statement reporting treatment since 2023.  The treating private physician noted the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma has required several treatments including radiation therapy, surgery, IV chemotherapy (Adriamycin), and oral therapy (pazopanib).  The private oncologist noted the Veteran's therapy was open ended and the Veteran's daily pazopanib continued indefinitely.  The treating oncologist noted future treatment decisions would be made based on routine lab work, imaging, and clinical assessment.

Thus, as the evidence of record has shown the Veteran was diagnosed with pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma in March 2023 and underwent surgery, radiation treatment, antineoplastic chemotherapy, and other therapeutic procedures for the entire period under review, the Veteran's disability warrants a 100 percent initial rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.73, DC 5329.  To this extent, the Veteran's claim is granted.

Effective Date

The Board notes the Veteran's December 2024 VA Form 10182 indicates the Veteran generally requests an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for his pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection and initial disability rating for a disease or injury is the day following separation from active duty or the date entitlement arose if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Id. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) provides an important exception to the general rule assigning an effective date.  If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). 

For claims within VA's modernized AMA review system, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the appropriate administrative review options, to include a supplemental claim, a request for HLR, or an appeal to the Board, following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

The Veteran filed VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File, received on April 17, 2023.  The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma, hearing loss, and hypertension in July 2023.  In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claims.  The Veteran sought review of the December 2023 rating decision by submitting a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review in February 2024.  Subsequent to the Veteran's timely and valid application for Higher Level Review, the AOJ granted service connection for the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma and assigned a noncompensable disability rating effective April 17, 2023.  The Veteran appealed the initial rating and effective date of service connection to the Board in the December 2024 Form 10182.

The Board finds the evidence of record indicates the date entitlement arose for the Veteran's left leg sarcoma occurred prior to receipt of the Veteran's intent to file and subsequent claim application.  The medical treatment history shows the Veteran reported symptoms of left leg pain and was diagnosed with pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma in March 2023.  Thus, as the record is absent any valid claim for service connection for the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma prior to receipt of the Veteran's intent to file on April 17, 2023, the criteria for an effective date earlier than April 17, 2023, have not been met.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

The Board notes the effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypertension may be a potential source of confusion for the Veteran when considering the April 17, 2023, effective date assigned to the award of service connection for the Veteran's pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma.  In his July 2023 claim, the Veteran applied for entitlement to service connection for pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma and hypertension.  

Notably, the grant of service connection for the Veteran's hypertension was awarded due to the newly established laws and regulations of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).  As compensation was awarded based on the presumptive service connection theory of entitlement for hypertension based on exposure to herbicide agents created in the PACT Act, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than August 10, 2022, the effective date of the act or administrative issue.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).  Moreover, as the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension was received within one year from the effective date of the enactment of the PACT Act, the effective date of the award of service connection for hypertension is August 10, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1).

However, the Veteran's grant of service connection for left leg pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma was not based on the newly established laws and regulations of the PACT ACT, and therefore, an award of an effective date earlier than April 17, 2023, is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.309, 3.114(a), 3.400.  To this extent, the Veteran's claim is denied.

Rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.324

The regulations provide that a 10 percent disability rating may be warranted whenever a veteran is suffering from two or more separate and permanent service-connected disabilities of such character as clearly to interfere with normal employability, even though none of the disabilities may be compensable under the Rating Schedule. 38 C.F.R. § 3.324. Accordingly, the provisions of § 3.324 are predicated on the existence of solely noncompensable service-connected disabilities. Thus, once a compensable rating for any service-connected disability has been awarded, the issue of entitlement to a rating under § 3.324 is rendered moot. See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 541 (1993).

In light of the Board's decision above, the Veteran is now in receipt of a compensable rating for his service-connected pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma throughout the period on appeal. See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 541 (1993). Accordingly, the claim for a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 is moot and must be dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his current hearing disability is related to his active-duty service, to include harmful noise exposure.

The Veteran's June 2023 private treatment record notes that the Veteran saw an audiologist every six months for treatment and care of hearing aids.  The record does not contain the Veteran's private audiologist treatment records. 

VA's duty to assist also includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from private medical care providers.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1).  Reasonable efforts will include an initial request and, if the records are not received, at least one follow-up request to the new source or an additional request to the original source.  Id.

Accordingly, a remand is required to correct VA's pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, and to make appropriate efforts in obtaining the Veteran's outstanding audiology treatment records.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).

Additionally, the Board notes the April 2024 VA examination with medical opinion regarding the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss is inadequate to adjudicate the Veteran's claim.  The VA examiner provided the medical opinion that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service.  The examiner opined that although the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise while in the military, the Veteran's entrance and separation audiograms were silent of hearing loss and do not show a shift in hearing threshold.

VA has a duty to provide the veteran a thorough medical examination that considers the veteran's prior medical history and provides sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability is fully informed.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).  A medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 299-304 (2008).  Further, the Board notes the absence of evidence of an auditory pathology in the service treatment records does not preclude service connection.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service); see also Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992) (finding that the lack of documented hearing loss while in service is not fatal to a claim for service connection).

In the present case, the VA opinion lacks a reasoned medical explanation for the negative nexus opinion and relies solely on the lack of documented hearing loss in service and on the separation examination.  Thus, a remand is required to address VA's pre-decisional duty-to-assist error and to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss.  Barr, supra, see also Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to obtain the names and addresses of any private medical care providers who treated the Veteran for hearing loss.  After securing the necessary releases, take all appropriate action to obtain these records.  Specifically, make reasonable attempts to obtain private audiology records in relation to care for hearing aids, noted in the June 2023 private treatment record.  

The AOJ must document all attempts to obtain these records.

2. After all outstanding records have been associated with the claims file, or reasonable efforts to obtain the Veteran's private medical records are complete, obtain a medical opinion from a qualified VA examiner regarding the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss.  The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner.

Following a review of the evidence of record, the examiner must opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss had its onset during or is otherwise etiologically related to active-duty service, to include harmful noise exposure.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including a clearly stated rationale for any opinions offered and conclusions reached.  The examiner must provide objective medical findings leading to the conclusions and must not base findings solely on the lack of records.  

In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such statements by the Veteran regarding symptomatology and medical history must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions concerning the onset and severity of his disability.  If such reports are rejected by the examiner, a reason for doing so must be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
