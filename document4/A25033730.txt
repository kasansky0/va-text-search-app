ORDER

Entitlement to benefits under the Home Improvement and Structural Alterations (HISA) program for installation of a first-floor walk-in shower is granted, subject to the lifetime limit under 38 U.S.C. § 1717.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A walk-in shower is necessary to provide the Veteran access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities.

2. The Veteran is service connected for low back strain, degenerative disc disease (DDD), lumbar spine cancerous lesion at 100 percent disabling; right and left lower extremity sciatic nerve peripheral neuropathy each at 40 percent disabling; for a combined rating of 100 percent from February 23, 2024; individual unemployability from March 23, 2001.

3. Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, a first-floor walk-in shower is needed due to his service-connected degenerative disc disease (DDD), cancer of the spine, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, pain, and use of a wheelchair. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for benefits under the HISA program for installation of a first-floor walk-in shower have been met, subject to the lifetime limit under 38 U.S.C. § 1717.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107 (b), 1710(a), 1717; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 17.3100-3130.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 1967 to July 1970, and from June 1971 to March 1976.  See DD 214.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 administrative decision of the Veterans Health Administration HISA Program.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran submitted a copy of the October 2024 VHA administrative decision and a statement with his VA Form 10182.  The VHA decision is not evidence and is already part of the record.  Additionally, the statement repeats information on the HISA application and evidence elsewhere found in the medical records.

In March 2025, the Board notified the Veteran of his right to switch dockets to either an Evidence Submission or Hearing docket within 60 days of receipt of his VA Form 10182, or within one year of the issuance of the VHA decision on appeal.  See March 2025 Board Docketing Letter.

As the Board is granting the claim for HISA benefits, the Veteran is not prejudiced by any lack of waiver of the time to switch dockets (one-year period from the decision on appeal).  Therefore, the Board proceeds to the merits of this appeal.

1. HISA for a walk-in shower

The Veteran seeks payment under the HISA program for a walk-in shower on the first floor of his home.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182; see also HISA File, received on March 4, 2025, pgs. 9-16 (containing HISA application). 

The claim was denied in October 2024, because the "[m]odification/adaptation is not within the scope of HISA benefit (See examples in VHA Directive 1173.14)."  HISA File, pg. 18 (containing denial letter).

HISA

VA may furnish medical services which VA determines to be needed to any veteran for a service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1710(a).  Needed medical services include home health services, found to be necessary or appropriate for the effective and economical treatment of the veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(1).

As part of home health services, HISA benefits may be furnished to a beneficiary for home improvements and structural alterations up to certain listed amounts. 38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(2)(ii).  The purpose of the HISA benefits program is to provide eligible beneficiaries monetary benefits for home improvements and structural alterations when such improvements and structural alterations: (1) are necessary for the continuation of the provision of home health treatment of the beneficiary's disability; or (2) provide the beneficiary with access to the home or with access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3100(a).  Improvements and structure alterations simply for personal comfort or that make living outside a hospital more acceptable may not be furnished. VAOPGCPREC 32-91 (Mar. 11, 1991).

For the purposes of the HISA benefits program (§§17.3100 through 17.3130), access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities means having "normal use" of the standard structural components of those facilities. 38 C.F.R. § 17.3101. Essential lavatory and sanitary facilities mean one bathroom equipped with a toilet and a shower or bath, one kitchen, and one laundry facility.  Id.  Improvement or structural alteration means a modification to a home or to an existing feature or fixture of a home, including repairs to or replacement of previously improved or altered features or fixtures.  Id. 

The determination of what is necessary and what is not necessary to assure the continuation of treatment is a question of medical fact.  VAOPGCPREC 32-91 (March 11, 1991).  Such a decision, "at least in part, requires the exercise of medical judgment, e.g., whether the services are needed to assure continuation of effective and economical treatment for the veteran's disability."  VAOPGCPREC 6-2001 at paragraph 16 (Feb. 8, 2001).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 17.3120, to apply for HISA benefits, the beneficiary must submit to VA a complete HISA benefits application package.  A complete HISA benefits application package includes all of the following:

(1) A prescription, which VA may obtain on the beneficiary's behalf, written or approved by a VA physician that includes all of the following: (i) the beneficiary's name, address, and telephone number; (ii) identification of the prescribed improvement or structural alteration; and (iii) the diagnosis and medical justification for the prescribed improvement or structural alteration.

(2) A completed and signed VA Form 10-0103, Veterans Application for Assistance in Acquiring Home Improvement and Structural Alterations, including, if desired, a request for advance payment of HISA benefits.

(3) A signed statement from the owner of the property authorizing the improvement or structural alteration to the property. The statement must be notarized if the beneficiary submitting the HISA benefits application is not the owner of the property.

(4) A written itemized estimate of costs for labor, materials, permits, and inspections for the home improvement or structural alteration.

(5) A color photograph of the unimproved area.

VA will approve the HISA benefits application if: (1) the application is consistent with §§17.3100 through 17.3130, and (2) VA determines that the proposed improvement or structural alteration is reasonably designed to address the needs of the beneficiary and is appropriate for the beneficiary's home, based on documentation provided and/or through a pre-award inspection of the home.  38 C.F.R. § 17.3125.

Examples of acceptable improvements or alterations listed in VHA Directive 1173.14, that meet the scope of HISA include but are not limited to the following: 

permanent ramps that allows entrance to or exit from the residence; access to kitchen or bathroom sinks or counters; entrance pathways or driveways; purchase and installation of environmental control units (ECUs) that require permanent improvements, alterations, and/or updates to the electrical system; updates to plumbing systems to support medical equipment and other essential lavatory or sanitary facilities; updates to electrical systems and whole-house generators to support Life Sustaining Equipment; central air conditioning; hardwood flooring; door latches; electrical outlets and wall switches; handrails (metal or wood); lowering of windows; modifying kitchen or bathroom counters; window tinting or shading; roll-in, barrier-free showers, or conversion from bathtub to seated shower; widening doorways to support wheelchair access, entry and exit to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities; . . .

Application

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran meets the basic eligibility criteria for HISA benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1717(a), in that he has a service-connected disability rated at 50 percent or more under 38 U.S.C. § 1710(a) (setting out nine possible bases for eligibility for VA care).  The Veteran is service connected for low back strain, degenerative disc disease (DDD), lumbar spine cancerous lesion at 100 percent disabling; right and left lower extremity sciatic nerve peripheral neuropathy each at 40 percent disabling; for a combined rating of 100 percent from February 23, 2024; he was granted individual unemployability from March 23, 2001.  See February 2025 Rating Decision Code Sheet.

A July 2024 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) indicates that the Veteran's back condition had worsened dramatically, with a cancerous lesion on the spine.  See July 2024 Bones and Other Skeletal Conditions DBQ, pg. 2.   The Veteran reported that he is in constant pain.  See id. at pg. 3. The VA examiner noted that Veteran was also diagnosed with primary malignant cancer of the spine and was undergoing antineoplastic chemotherapy.  See id. at pg. 4.  Due to his condition, the Veteran reported the constant use of a wheelchair, regular use of a mobility scooter, and occasional use of a walker.  See id. at pg. 5.  The Veteran reported that due to his back pain, and pain in his legs, he can't walk and must use a wheelchair or walker to stabilize himself.  See June 2025 DBQ, pg. 1. 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a signed HISA application for a first- floor walk-in shower in his existing home, which contained the required elements for review, such as an estimate and color photos.  See HISA File, pgs. 9.  The claim was denied because the modification was determined not be within the scope of HISA benefits. However, the VHA file cited in the denial, clearly lists roll-in barrier free showers as within the scope of a HISA.  Therefore, the Board finds that the decision appears to be based on an inaccurate factual premise.  

The record clearly indicates that he has trouble walking, uses a wheelchair constantly, and would therefore need a shower on the first floor which was a walk-in style to accommodate his limited ability to move.  The Veteran is competent to report that he had difficulty with stairs, and the Board finds him to be credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is considered competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  The Board also finds that due to his constant use of the wheelchair, there is a clinical need for the shower to have roll-in access.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding a material issue, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The Veteran has competently, consistently, and credibly reported his limitations in walking, moving, and navigating his home.  The Board finds no reason to doubt his credibility. 

The Board finds that the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to the need for the barrier free shower on the first floor.  If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application).

Upon review of the record, and after resolving reasonable doubt for the Veteran, the Board finds that there is a clinical need for the barrier free shower on the first floor, due to his trouble walking, dependence on a wheelchair, back and leg pain, and difficulty navigating stairs.  Therefore, HISA benefits for installation of a roll-in shower on the first floor of his home is granted, subject to the lifetime limit under 38 U.S.C. § 1717.
