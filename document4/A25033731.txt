REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 1966 to October 1968. 

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2024 decision. In October 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2024 decision. 

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, including a claim for secondary service connection, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for osteoporosis of the lumbar spine, flexion of the right and left hip, as well as impairment of the right and left hip as secondary to service connected MGUS. The award was made effective from June 5, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's claim for osteoporosis.

The Veteran contends that an effective date of August 10, 2022, is warranted, because his claim for osteoporosis was reasonably raised in conjunction with his claim for service connection for MGUS. Service connection for MGUS became effective based on the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxic Acts of 2022 (PACT Act). Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2), once VA receives a complete claim, it will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition.

Effective on March 24, 2015, VA amended its rules as to what constitutes a claim for benefits. The amended rule requires that claims be made on a specific claim form prescribed by VA and available online or at a local RO. Prior to March 2015, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Mere presence of evidence in the record of the existence of a disability did not establish intent to seek service connection. To establish a claim, the Veteran had to assert the claim expressly or impliedly. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995) (while the Board must interpret a veteran's submissions broadly, the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the veteran). Indeed, VA's duty to adjudicate all claims reasonably raised does not require VA to anticipate a claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed. See Brannon, supra.

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that the record does not show an intent from the Veteran to raise a claim for service connection for osteoporosis prior to the June 5, 2023, claim. The Veteran's medical treatment records are silent for any connection between osteoporosis and MGUS prior to June 2023. The only evidence of record that could imply any link between the Veteran's osteoporosis and MGUS can be found in a February 2023 VA examination. During this examination, the Veteran stated that he has osteoporosis and feels that it is indirectly related to the MGUS. No other discussion regarding any connection between the two disabilities can be found in the record. While this notation in the VA examination shows the Veteran felt that there was possibly a link between his osteoporosis and MGUS, the Board finds this is not sufficient to show any intention on the part of the Veteran to raise a claim for service connection. As stated above, although VA has a duty to adjudicate all claims reasonably raised before it, this does not require VA to anticipate a claim for a particular benefit. The mere assertion on the part of the Veteran that there may be an indirect connection between his osteoporosis and MGUS does not rise to the level of an intent to raise a claim for secondary service connection.

Therefore, as there was no claim for secondary service connection reasonably raised before the June 2023 formal filing of a claim, the current June 5, 2023, effective date is proper.
