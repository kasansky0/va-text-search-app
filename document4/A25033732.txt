ORDER

New and relevant evidence not having been received, readjudication of the claim of service connection for residuals of right nephrectomy and hydronephrosis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Evidence received since the August 2020 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for residuals of right nephrectomy and hydronephrosis is not new and relevant. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

New and relevant evidence has not been received and, therefore, the requirements for readjudication of the service connection claim for residuals of right nephrectomy and hydronephrosis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A (h), 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156 (d), 3.2501, 19.2.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty military service from February 2016 to June 2020.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal of a rating decision issued in December 2023 which denied readjudication of the claim of service connection for residuals of right nephrectomy and hydronephrosis. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Readjudication of the claim of service connection for residuals of right nephrectomy and hydronephrosis 

The Veteran seeks service connection for residuals of hydronephrosis and a resulting right nephrectomy performed in service, which she asserts represented an aggravation of her underlying kidney issues predating service. (See Fully Developed Claim, 07/09/2021.) She previously filed a claim for this disability in April 2020, prior to her service separation. (See Fully Developed Claim, 04/29/2020.) This claim was denied in August 2020. (See Rating Decision, 08/26/2020.) She filed for readjudication of the claim in July 2021 and that claim was denied in August 2021. (See VA Form 20-0996, 07/08/2021; Rating Decision, 08/25/2021.) The current claim for readjudication was filed in June 2023. (See Supplemental Claim, 06/26/2023.) (The Board notes that in March 2022 and again in August 2022 the Veteran filed Fully Developed Claim forms asking to have the claim readjudicated. Readjudication of a claim requires that the form submitted by a Supplemental Claim form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.180.)

VA regulations provide that a claimant who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending or has become finally adjudicated. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured concerning the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  In determining whether new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, VA will consider any VA treatment records reasonably identified by the claimant and any evidence received by VA after VA issued a notice of a decision on the claim and while the evidentiary record was closed.

New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

In this instance, the Veteran's initial claim of service connection for hydronephrosis and right nephrectomy was denied in an August 2020 rating decision. (See Rating Decision, 08/26/2020.) The AOJ found that the Veteran had a right kidney disability that pre-existed her entrance to the military and was not aggravated in service. The AOJ specifically cited the VA examination and opinion finding no evidence that the Veteran's right kidney disability was permanently worsened by service. The examiner noted that the Veteran's right kidney was removed in service due to atrophy but stated that this was a natural progression of the Veteran's chronic hydronephrosis which existed prior to service. 

The Veteran filed a Request for Higher Level Review appeal of the August 2020 denial in July 2021. As this was filed within one year of the decision, the appeal was timely. The August 2021 rating decision noted the VA examination and opinion in July and August 2020 to the effect that the Veteran's pre-existing kidney issues were not aggravated or worsened beyond their normal course during the Veteran's military service. There was no evidence to the contrary and the rating decision confirmed the denial of service connection. 

The Veteran sought readjudication of this claim by filing a Supplemental Claim in June 2023. (See Supplemental Claim, 06/26/2023.) Between the August 2021 rating decision and the December 2023 rating decision on appeal here, there has been minimal evidence added to the record. VA treatment CAPRI records were added in August 2022, April 2023, and September 2023. None of the records pertained to the question of service connection for kidney issues or aggravation of kidney issues in service. The Veteran also underwent a VA examination during that time period, but this was related to a claim for hearing loss and tinnitus. (See C&P Exam, 04/21/2023.) The only document submitted to the record during the period between the August 2020 denial and the December 2023 denial which pertained to the Veteran's claim for kidney disability was a copy of the April 2017 surgical treatment record from service. (See JLV/MTF, 11/02/2023.) This was an exact duplicate of the surgical treatment record already included in the file and considered in the August 2020 denial. While the VA treatment records and VA examination were new, they had no bearing on the Veteran's claim for kidney disabilities. In contrast, the April 2017 surgical report was relevant to the Veteran's claim, but as a duplicate, it was not new evidence. Simply put, none of the minimal evidence added to the record between August 2020 and December 2023 was both new and relevant as required for readjudication of the claim. Therefore, the Veteran's appeal for readjudication must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103A (h), 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d).

The Board notes that VA is unable to take any substantive action on this claim without the submission of additional evidence, in this instance, evidence beyond the Veteran's own statements that indicates her pre-existing kidney issues were aggravated by her military service and that the hydronephrosis and right nephrectomy were not part of the normal progression of those pre-existing issues. Examples of such evidence would include a medical opinion or evidence that the Veteran did not have hydronephrosis at the time of service entrance, medical research or studies indicating that the changes in service were outside the normal course of her pre-existing kidney issues. As discussed, such evidence has not been received and the request for readjudication is denied.
