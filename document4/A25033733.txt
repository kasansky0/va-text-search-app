DOCKET NO. 241216-498234
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), to include as due to exposure to herbicides, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran has, or has had, at any time during the appeals period, a current diagnosis of a chronic fatigue disability (CFS).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a chronic fatigue disorder (CFS) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter is advanced on the docket due to the Veteran's advanced age. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 1965 to December 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction. In December 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), requesting Direct review of the claim. Given his explicit selection of this review lane, combined with the determination to advance the appeal on the docket due to the Veteran's age, the Board finds an implied waiver of the option to switch the selected review lane. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.2023(c); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet App. 305 (2024). 

Service Connection

Under the laws administered by VA, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge from service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be established under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) when the evidence, regardless of its date, shows that a veteran had a chronic condition in service, such as arthritis, or during the applicable presumptive period. In addition, certain chronic diseases may be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated during service if they become disabling to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity is not established, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). However, the regulatory provisions pertaining to chronicity and continuity of symptomatology are constrained by 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), and, thus, such provisions are only available to establish service connection for the specific chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service connected disability. In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Entitlement to service connection for CFS 

The Veteran contends that he has a chronic fatigue disorder related to his military service, to explicitly include toxic exposure during his deployment in Vietnam. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of CFS and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d). Therefore, without a current disability, the Veteran's claim must be denied.

As an initial matter, a close review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) is void of any findings, complaints, symptoms, or any diagnoses related to CFS. Likewise, post-service, VA treatment records are void of any diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome or similar condition.

The Veteran was provided VA examinations in April 2022, July 2023, and August 2024. The VA examiners reviewed the record, interviewed the Veteran and conducted in-person examinations. The VA examiners completed an analysis on VA chronic fatigue syndrome questionnaire reports. In these reports, the examiners noted subjective reports from the Veteran with regarding symptoms of fatigue and sleep disturbance, however, considering the totality of the Veteran's medical history, found against any clinically diagnosable disability of CFS. To this end, in the April 2022 report, the VA examiner explicitly noted that the Veteran's waxing and waning reports of intermittent fatigue and sleep disturbance are symptoms of his heart condition, and not a separate clinically diagnosable condition like CFS. 

In this case, the Board finds that the VA examinations and opinions provide probative evidence against the claim. The VA examiners all noted review of the claims file, considered the Veteran's documented and reported history, and performed thorough evaluations. The examiners all explained that the Veteran's reported symptoms, or then lack thereof, and examination findings, did not meet the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. As the examiners' opinions reflect consideration of all pertinent evidence and is supported by thorough rationale, the opinions are afforded significant probative weight against the claim. See Nieves -Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

As the competent medical evidence does not show diagnosis of, or disability related to chronic fatigue syndrome, service connection is denied. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). To this end, other than his initial claim noting, generally a claim for CFS, the Veteran has not submitted any arguments or assertions noting any symptoms related to his claimed disability. As such, the Board considers the VA examination dispositive of the claim.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. In this case there is an absence of proof of chronic fatigue syndrome during or in proximity to the appeal period. Without evidence of a current diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome the Board need not address the other elements of service connection. The evidence is therefore against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
