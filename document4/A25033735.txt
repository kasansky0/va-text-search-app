REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Army from October 1983 to October 1987.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Supplemental Claim rating decision and a February 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision, following a January 2024 rating decision, of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) RO.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  She acknowledged that Direct Review would entail the Board reviewing the evidence of record at the time of the prior decisions, with no evidence submission or hearing requests.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 and January 2024 decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

The Board notes that, although in his July 2024 VA Form 10182 the Veteran referenced the evaluation and effective date for the right hip disabilities, in the attached brief, her attorney clarified, "Based on the evidence, the Board should award the Veteran earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction, extension, and flexion, as well as entitlement to individual unemployability and Dependents' Educational Assistance for the period prior to August 08, 2023."  The attorney specifically asserted that all grants should be effective December 31, 2020, the date of the continuously pursued claims.  For the reasons below, the Board will grant the benefit sought with regard to each claim.  

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim for compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall be no earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The statutory provision is implemented by regulation which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

The effective date of an award of compensation based on a claim for increase is fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall be no earlier than the date of receipt of the application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The statutory provision is implemented by regulation, which provides that the effective date for an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, when the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation, the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from that date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  

Significantly, AMA implementing regulation 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) provides, "Except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision."  The available review options in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) include filing a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals following notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim.  That is precisely what occurred in this case.  

1. Entitlement to an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction (recharacterized as right hip osteoarthritis with thigh impairment), is granted.  

See discussion in Paragraph 3

2. Entitlement to an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of extension, is granted.  

See discussion in Paragraph 3

3. Entitlement to an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of flexion, is granted.  

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grants of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction, flexion, and extension.  Specifically, her attorney asserts that December 31, 2020, the date of the original claim for service connection, should be the effective date.  See July 2024 Attorney Brief.  The Board agrees.  

By way of history, on December 31, 2020, the Veteran, in pertinent part, initially filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability.  In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO denied the claim.  Then, in July 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2021 rating decision, specifically asserting, in pertinent part, service connection for a right hip disability.  In an August 2022 HLR decision, the RO continued to deny the claim.  Then, in August 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim), requesting to reopen her service connection claim for a right hip disability.  In an October 2023 Supplemental Claim rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction, flexion, and extension.  The effective date for each award was August 8, 2023.  

Based on the above procedural history, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously prosecuted her claim for entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability since the initial filing on December 31, 2020.  Thus, the Board finds that an effective date of December 31, 2020, is warranted for the grants of service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction, flexion, and extension.  

4. Entitlement to an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU is granted.  

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of a TDIU.  The current effective date is August 8, 2023, the date VA received the VA Form 21-8940 application for a TDIU.  The Veteran generally argues that the effective date for her TDIU should be December 31, 2020, the date VA received her initial application for service connection for her psychiatric disorder and the effective date for service connection for this disability.  

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is a sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  Here, the Veteran's disabilities have met the schedular requirements for a TDIU since December 31, 2020.  

On December 31, 2020, the Veteran filed an application for service connection for depression.  In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO denied the claim.  

On July 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, and requested review of the September 2021 rating decision, specifically asserting, in pertinent part, service connection for depression.  In an August 2022 HLR decision, the RO continued to deny the claim.  

Then, on August 8, 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995, requesting to reopen her service connection claim for depression.  On the same day, the Veteran also submitted a VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  The Veteran argued that her depression prevented her from working.  

In a December 2023 Supplemental Claim rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, effective August 8, 2023.  On December 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, and requested review of the December 2023 decision, specifically asserting an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for adjustment disorder.  In a December 22, 2023, HLR decision, the RO granted entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for adjustment disorder and assigned an effective date of December 31, 2020, the date VA received her initial application for service connection.  

Then, in a January 2024 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to a TDIU.  In granting the TDIU, the RO explained that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, specifically, in part, as a result of her service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The effective date for the TDIU was set as August 8, 2023, the date the VA Form 21-8940 was received.  On February 12, 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, and requested review of the January 2024 rating decision, specifically asserting, in pertinent part, an earlier effective date for the grant of a TDIU.  A February 20, 2024, HLR decision denied the claim.  In July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, seeking, in pertinent part, an earlier effective date for her TDIU, resulting in this appeal.  

A request for a TDIU is not a separate claim for benefits and involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate disability rating either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim or as part of a claim for increased compensation.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54.  Depending upon the status of a veteran's adjudicated disabilities at the time he/she presents evidence of unemployability, the issue of whether a TDIU will be assigned will be handled either during the determination of the initial disability rating assigned at the time the underlying disability is found to be service connected, or if the veteran later asserts that his/her disability has worsened, as a claim for increased compensation.  Id. at 452-53.  

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) reiterated that a TDIU is not a separate claim but is instead a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 397 (2024).  The Court also explained that when VA must consider entitlement to a TDIU is dependent upon when a veteran submits evidence of unemployability.  If a veteran applies for service connection and VA learns the veteran cannot work, then VA must consider TDIU when assigning the appropriate rating.  When a veteran already has service connection for a disability and applies for a higher rating, then VA needs to consider TDIU when it receives evidence of unemployability.  Id. at 401.  

Here, VA received evidence that the Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder prevented her from working while her claim for service connection for depression was pending.  The issue of entitlement to a TDIU was raised while the Veteran was seeking service connection for depression.  The RO then granted service connection for adjustment disorder in a December 2023 decision.  In a December 22, 2023, HLR decision, the RO granted entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for adjustment disorder and assigned an effective date of December 31, 2020, the date VA received her initial application for service connection.  Then, in a January 2024 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective August 8, 2023.  As previously noted, the grant of a TDIU was predicated on the Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder.  As a result, the Veteran's TDIU is considered part of the underlying claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder as an option for the potential rating for adjustment disorder.  The eventual effective date for the TDIU depends on the effective date for service connection for adjustment disorder, as service connection for adjustment disorder was the specific claim VA was adjudicating when evidence of a TDIU as an appropriate evaluation for that disability was received.  Phillips, 37 Vet. App. at 401; Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 454.  

Considering the holdings in Phillips and Rice, the Board finds December 31, 2020, is the appropriate effective date for the Veteran's TDIU.  The Veteran filed her initial application for service connection for depression on December 31, 2020. She then raised the issue of a TDIU due to her depression while the claim for service connection for depression was pending.  The Board issued the December 2023 and January 2024 decisions granting service connection for adjustment disorder and entitlement to a TDIU predicated on the service-connected adjustment disorder, respectively.  The Court has held that a TDIU is not a separate claim and is instead one way to establish the appropriate rating for a given disability.  If a veteran applies for service connection and VA learns the veteran cannot work, VA must consider TDIU when assigning the appropriate rating for the claimed disability.  Phillips, 37 Vet. App, at 400-1.  Here, for effective date purposes, VA was required to consider TDIU when assigning the initial rating for the Veteran's adjustment disorder.  

The Board finds that December 31, 2020, is also the date entitlement to a TDIU arose.  The RO granted TDIU based primarily on the effects of the Veteran's adjustment disorder.  As noted above, prior to the grants of service connection for adjustment disorder and entitlement to a TDIU, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for right hip osteoarthritis, limitation of abduction, flexion, and extension in an October 2023 decision.  In that decision, the RO also continued the noncompensable ratings for left hammer toes and right hammer toes.  None of those claims currently remain pending, and none pre-dated December 31, 2020.  In addition, no other claims for either an increased rating or for service connection for a disability remained open when the Veteran's application for entitlement to service connection for depression was received on December 31, 2020.  

In sum, evidence that the Veteran's adjustment disorder caused her to be unemployable was received while the claim for service connection for depression was pending.  Consequently, a TDIU as an appropriate rating is considered part of the underlying claim for service connection for depression as an option for a potential rating.  The Veteran's initial application for the claim of entitlement to service connection for depression was received on December 31, 2020, which is the effective date for service connection for adjustment disorder, as well as both the date of claim and the date entitlement arose for TDIU.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

5. Entitlement to an effective date of December 31, 2020, but no earlier, for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is granted.  

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for DEA benefits pursuant to 35, Title 38 of the United States Code.  The Veteran was awarded eligibility to DEA in the January 2024 rating decision, effective August 8, 2023, based upon the RO's finding that she was permanently unable, as of that date, to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to her service-connected disabilities.  

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.  

As explained above, the Board has found that the appropriate effective date of the Veteran's TDIU is December 31, 2020.  Since the effective date for DEA benefits in this case is directly related to a finding that the Veteran had a total disability that was permanent in nature by virtue of her TDIU rating, the Board finds that an effective date of December 31, 2020, for Chapter 35 benefits is warranted.
