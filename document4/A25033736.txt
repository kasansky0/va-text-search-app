DOCKET NO. 241015-483337
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The October 2024 appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder and a dental disorder is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2025, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1981 to February 1985. These matters are on appeal from a May 2024 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran. Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/. If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

In sum, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
