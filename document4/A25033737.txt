CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for skin cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1970 to September 1975.

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 13, 2025, before a Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that proceeding is of record.  The Board finds that all requirements for hearings have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2) (2023); Bryant v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 488 (2010).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

The Board notes that service connection for prostate cancer and service connection for a skin condition had been denied by the Regional Office previously; however, the rating decision on appeal found that new and relevant evidence has been submitted as a favorable finding and the Board will proceed to adjudication.

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer

A June 2024 VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of prostate cancer in 2013. 

A September 2024 VA Memorandum confirms that the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) due to his MOS as a Transport Pilot, to include exposure to aviation fuels, fumes, solvents, lubricants, and particulates, and also due to being stationed at Mather Air Force Base, and TERA exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 

A February 2025 private medical examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer is at least as likely as not caused by or a result of the Veteran's military service, specifically stating that medical research demonstrates that the TERAs that the Veteran was exposed to have demonstrated to produce many health issues including cancer.

Therefore, the evidence is at least in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's prostate cancer was caused by his conceded in-service TERAs and thus, this claim in granted in full, obviating the need for further detailed discussion thereof. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer.

A June 2024 VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of malignant melanoma and skin cancer (SSCIS Lower Back) in 2023.

A September 2024 VA Memorandum confirms that the Veteran participated in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) due to his MOS as a Transport Pilot, to include exposure to aviation fuels, fumes, solvents, lubricants, and particulates, and also due to being stationed at Mather Air Force Base, and TERA exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 

A February 2025 private medical examiner opined that the Veteran's skin cancer is at least as likely as not caused by or a result of the Veteran's military service, specifically stating that medical research demonstrates that the TERAs that the Veteran was exposed to have demonstrated to produce many health issues including cancer.

Therefore, the evidence is at least in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran's prostate cancer was caused by his conceded in-service TERAs and thus, this claim in granted in full, obviating the need for further detailed discussion thereof.
