ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his currently diagnosed tinnitus had its onset during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) due to exposure to excessive noise.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (22)-(24), 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, who achieved Veteran status by virtue of a service-connected disability, served on ACDUTRA from October 1977 to March 1978. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In October 2024, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, based on the evidence the Board may consider, service connection for tinnitus is awarded herein, which is a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

A veteran is a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or released under conditions "other than dishonorable." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (d). The term "active military, naval, or air service" includes: (1) active duty; (2) any period of ACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; and (3) any period of inactive duty for training during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident which occurred during such training. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22)-(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (a). ACDUTRA includes full-time duty performed by members of the National Guard of any State or the Reserve. 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c). Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

The Veteran contends that he currently has tinnitus that is related to exposure to excessive noise from loud machinery, firearms, and munitions during his Reserve service, to include his documented period of ACDUTRA. In this regard, his service personnel records reflect that his assigned military occupational specialty was as a machine gunner, and he was awarded the Sharpshooter Rifle Badge. Additionally, at the February 2024 VA examination, tinnitus was diagnosed, and the Veteran reported the onset of such disorder, which has remained constant over time, while in infantry training school in 1978.   

Based on the Veteran's reports of the onset of his tinnitus during ACDUTRA commensurate with his exposure to excessive noise, and the lack of entrance or separation audiometric examinations in his service treatment records (STRs), thus failing to show a determination of decreased hearing therein, the VA examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not that his current tinnitus is caused by or a result of military noise exposure. In further support thereof, she cited medical literature for the proposition that excessive noise exposure is known to cause tinnitus even in the presence of normal hearing sensitivity. 

However, contrary to the February 2024 VA examiner's determination, the Veteran's STRs do, in fact, contain audiometric testing conducted prior to his period of ACDUTRA in March 1977 and at the time of his separation from ACDUTRA in March 1978. In this regard, such shows decreased hearing in the left ear at 6000 Hertz at separation, which was the basis of the award of service connection for such disorder in an April 2024 rating decision. 

Thus, to the extent that any doubt remains, the Board resolves such in favor of the Veteran and finds that his currently diagnosed tinnitus had its onset during a period of ACDUTRA due to exposure to excessive noise. Therefore, service connection for such disorder is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
