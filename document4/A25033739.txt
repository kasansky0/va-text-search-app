FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has continuously pursued a February 3, 2020, claim for an increased rating for his GERD, preceding which an intent to file was received by VA on January 31, 2020.

2. The Veteran's GERD, considered without the ameliorating effects of medication, manifests in a combination of symptoms productive of severe impairment of health.

3. The Veteran's GERD, considered without the ameliorating effects of medication, does not manifest in a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal strictures treated with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube. 

4. Prior to February 13, 2020, the Veteran's unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder manifested in symptoms of suicidal ideation, lashing out, depression, and sleep disruption that created occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 

5. Prior to February 13, 2020, the Veteran's unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder did not manifest in symptoms creating total occupational and social impairment. 

6. On and after February 13, 2020, and prior to August 12, 2020, the Veteran's unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder did not manifest in symptoms creating occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks.

7. On and after August 12, 2020, the Veteran's unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder manifested in symptoms of reclusiveness, distrust for others, problems concentrating and focusing, and anger and crying outbursts that created occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

8. On and after August 12, 2020, the Veteran's unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder did not manifest in symptoms creating total occupational and social impairment.

9. The Veteran's hypertension does not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or in systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

10. Prior to December 22, 2021, the Veteran was substantially and gainfully employed.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1994 to February 1995, August 2004 to January 2006, and February 2007 to July 2010.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 higher-level review of a November 28, 2022, rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In June 2024, VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement (NOD) electing the Board's Direct Review docket. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence reviewed by the July 2023 higher-level review, that is, the evidence of record at the time of the November 28, 2022, rating decision it reviewed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

Applicable Evidentiary Window

Given the Veteran's election of the Direct Review docket, in this decision the Board has only considered the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of the decision on review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). For the claims that are being remanded, if evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time for which the Board cannot review the evidence, the Board has not considered that evidence in this decision, but the evidence will be considered by the AOJ when it readjudicates the matter following this decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(c).

Construing an Issue on Appeal

The NOD underlying this appeal was filed by the Veteran through his attorney. One of the issues the attorney disagreed with on behalf of the Veteran is the "[e]arlier effective date for PTSD." As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran's service-connected disability is presently characterized by the AOJ as "other specified trauma and stressor disorder." Previously, the AOJ characterized it as "posttraumatic stress disorder (previously rated as other specified trauma and stressor related disorder)." See August 4, 2020, Rating Decision; November 23, 2020, Rating Decision. The Board has characterized the disability as other specified trauma and stressor disorder consistent with the AOJ's present characterization of the disability. Further, below, the Board also explains now why it will reconstrue the request for an "earlier effective date" as a claim for an increased initial rating. 

An August 2020 rating decision granted service connection for other specified trauma and stressor disorder and assigned an initial rating of 10 percent from an effective date of January 31, 2020. See August 4, 2020, Rating Decision. The present appeal stems from the Veteran's continuously pursued review of the first, August 2020 rating decision initial rating of 10 percent. As mentioned, the Veteran's attorney wants the 70 percent rating assigned from an "earlier effective date" of January 31, 2020, the date service connection began. Notwithstanding that attorneys are presumed to be versed in the law and facts and therefore should be given latitude in shaping their appellate strategies, see, e.g., Janssen v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2001), the Board will liberally construe the NOD's request for an "earlier effective date" as seeking an increased initial rating, which allows the Board to consider entitlement to any initial rating higher than 10 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a) (requiring the Board to construe arguments in a liberal manner for determining the issues raised on appeal). 

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal for an "earlier effective date" for a 70 percent rating will be adjudicated as entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I. Effective Dates

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to August 31, 2020, for the award of a 10 percent rating for his GERD. More specifically, he seeks restoration of the originally assigned effective date of January 31, 2020, for the grant of a 10 percent rating for GERD in a February 24, 2021, rating decision, which was subsequently revised to an effective date of August 31, 2020, upon a finding of a clear and unmistakable error.

1. Legal Criteria 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim; a claim reopened after final disallowance; or a claim for an increase will be the date the claim was received or the date the entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" is defined broadly to mean a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151(a).

A claimant may file an intent to file a claim to preserve an earlier effective date. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA receives a complete application in the form prescribed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) within one year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete application filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id. However, only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). If multiple complete claims for a benefit are received within one year of an intent to file, only the complete claim received first in time will be associated with the intent to file a claim. Id. 

VA will not recognize more than one intent to file at a time for the same type of benefit sought (e.g., compensation, pension). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6). Further, if an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file for the same type of benefit received within one year of the prior intent to file will have no effect. Id. If, however, VA receives an intent to file a claim followed by a complete claim and another intent to file a claim for the same type of benefit is subsequently received within one year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file for purposes of preserving an earlier effective date for the next complete claim. Id.

In the AMA, a claim may be continuously pursued by timely and properly filing an appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ after the issuance of an AOJ decision, Board decision, or decision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). An appeal to the Board or a review option before the AOJ is timely if it is received by VA within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). It is properly filed when it is on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that specific claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

More specifically, following an AOJ decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the claimant may continuously pursue that claim by seeking review of that decision by the AOJ by filing a VA Form 20-0995 (supplemental claim), filing a VA Form 20-0996 (HLR), or appealing that decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).

Following an AOJ HLR decision, the claimant may continuously pursue that claim by seeking review of that decision by the AOJ by filing a VA Form 20-0995 (supplemental claim) or appealing that decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(2).

When a claim has been continuously pursued, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

2. Evidence

As a matter of procedural history, VA received an intent to file for VA compensation benefits on January 31, 2020. See February 3, 2020, Notification Letter. Thereafter, VA received a February 3, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking, in pertinent part, an increased rating for his GERD. In response, the AOJ issued the August 4, 2020, rating decision, which denied a compensable rating for GERD. 

Rather than immediately seeking review of the August 4, 2020, rating decision by the AOJ by filing a VA Form 20-0995 (supplemental claim) or a VA Form 20-0996 (HLR), or appealing the decision to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182, the Veteran initially opted to submit a new claim for an increased rating via an August 31, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ. In response, the AOJ issued the January 23, 2021, rating decision granting an increased rating of 10 percent for the Veteran's GERD effective January 31, 2020, the date VA received the intent to file associated with the February 2020 claim for an increased rating. However, a month later, the AOJ issued a February 22, 2021, rating decision finding CUE in its January 23, 2021, rating decision as to the effective date assigned. The AOJ explained that the assignment of the January 31, 2020, intent to file was error because the January 31, 2020, intent to file could not be associated with the August 31, 2020, VA Form 21-526E since it had already been associated with the February 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ. He timely sought HLR review of the February 22, 2021, rating decision by submitting a July 23, 2021, VA Form 20-0996. 

Eventually, the Veteran sought HLR review of the August 6, 2020, rating decision by the AOJ on July 21, 2021, by submitting a VA Form 20-0996. The July 21, 2020, VA Form 20-0996, was untimely as to the August 6, 2020, rating decision (notice of which was also provided by VA on August 6, 2020). Notwithstanding, the AOJ accepted both the July 21, 2021, and July 23, 2021, VA Forms 20-0996, and issued a September 7, 2021, HLR rating decision continuing the August 31, 2020, effective date assigned for the award of the 10 percent rating. 

Thereafter, the Veteran timely sought review of the September 7, 2021, rating decision by submitting a May 2022 VA Form 20-0995 (supplemental claim). The AOJ issued a November 23, 2022, rating decision, which again denied an earlier effective date for the award of the 10 percent rating. Subsequently, he timely sought HLR review of the November 23, 2022, rating decision by submitting a March 2023 VA Form 20-0996. As a result, the AOJ issued the July 6, 2023, rating decision on appeal. 

3. Discussion 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to the reinstatement of a January 31, 2020, effective date for the award of the 10 percent rating for his GERD. See June 2024 Addendum to VA Form 10182. More specifically, he asserts that the AOJ finding of CUE in the August 2020 rating decision was based on an inaccurate factual assessment. He states that it appeared the AOJ was "suggesting that [he] did not file a claim for his GERD until August 31, 2020[,] as the intent to file would not impact it." However, he filed a claim in February 2020, which was denied in the August 4, 2020, rating decision. Thus, to the extent he filed a claim for an increased rating less than a month later on August 31, 2020, it was in response to the August 4, 2020, rating decision. For that reason, he contends that he has continuously pursued his February 2020 claim for an increased rating, which was associated with the January 31, 2020, intent to file.

The Veteran's contention that the August 31, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ, preserved his continuous pursuit of the February 2020 claim for an increased rating for his GERD is incorrect. To continuously pursue that claim, following the issuance of the August 6, 2020, rating decision, he was required to seek review of that decision by the AOJ by filing a VA Form 20-0995 (supplemental claim) or filing a VA Form 20-0996 (HLR), or appealing that decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1). 

Though the particular form utilized may not necessarily limit the nature of the claim, here, there is nothing in the August 31, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ indicating that he meant to seek a review of the denial of the claim for an increased rating for his GERD in the August 6, 2020, rating decision. Moreover, the AOJ processed (and granted) the claim without requiring the Veteran submit new and relevant evidence, as it would have if the claim were a supplemental claim and considered evidence associated with the claims file after the issuance of the August 6, 2020, rating decision, which it would not have been permitted to during an HLR. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104B, 5108(a); see Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, at *8-11 (Vet. App. March 14, 2025). 

On these facts, the Board finds that the August 31, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ did not initiate an AOJ review of the August 6, 2020, rating decision and constituted a new claim for an increased rating. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 284 (2024) (noting that different evidence is needed for different increased-rating claims, and therefore a claim for an increased rating, as opposed to an appeal of an initial rating, "is a new claim"); id. at 292 (remarking that Congress intended through AMA a statutory scheme "differentiat[ing] supplemental claims from increased compensation claims").

Notwithstanding, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the February 2020 claim for an increased rating for his GERD. As noted above, the Veteran untimely sought HLR review of the August 6, 2020, rating decision by the AOJ on July 21, 2021, by submitting a VA Form 20-0996. The Board finds that the AOJ waived any objections it had to the untimeliness of the July 21, 2021, VA Form 20-0996 as to the August 6, 2020, rating decision when it accepted and processed the HLR request. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2004); Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 334 (2021). Following that waiver of timeliness by the AOJ, the Veteran has otherwise timely sought review of the claim stemming from the February 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

As the AOJ originally found that the evidence of record support a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's GERD effective January 31, 2020, and seeing that the February 2020 claim for an increased rating has been continuously pursued, the Board finds an effective date of January 31, 2020, the date the intent to file associated with the February 2020 claim was received, for the award of the 10 percent rating for GERD is warranted.  

II. Increased Ratings

The Veteran seeks increased ratings for his service-connected other trauma and stressor related disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hypertension.

Disability ratings are determined by assessing the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (also referred to as the Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Where a veteran challenges the initial rating of a disability for which the veteran has been granted service connection, the Board considers all evidence of severity since the effective date for the award of service connection. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125 (1999). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). 

To rate a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the entire record to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

A. GERD

The Veteran appeals the denial of a rating higher than 10 percent for his service-connected GERD. 

1. Legal Criteria

The Veteran's GERD is currently rated under DC 7399-7346, meaning it is rated analogously to DC 7346, for hiatal hernia. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114; see 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. (The Veteran's GERD is rated in combination with his hiatal hernia, because the applicable regulation requires a single evaluation reflecting the predominant disability picture. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. The rating for the Veteran's hiatal hernia is not an issue on appeal.)

While this appeal was pending, amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 became effective on May 19, 2024. 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (Mar. 20, 2024). The amendments added a specific DC for GERD, DC 7206. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. In this situation, for the portion of the period on review before May 19, 2024, the pre-amended regulations will be applied, while for the portion of the period on and after May 19, 2024, either the pre-amended or amended rating criteria will be applied, whichever results in a higher rating for the Veteran. See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328 (2003).

Under the pre-amended rating criteria, DC 7346, for hiatal hernia, provided a 10 percent rating where there were two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity. A 30 percent rating was warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A 60 percent rating, the highest available under the criteria, was warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346 (2023). 

The Rating Schedule does not define persistently recurrent epigastric distress, considerable impairment of health, or severe impairment of health, so the Board gives the words their plain meanings. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015). "Persistent" means "existing for a long or longer than usual time or continuously" or "continuing to exist despite interference or treatment." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "persistent," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/persistent (last viewed March 2025). "Recurrent" means "returning or happening time after time." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "recurrent," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/recurrent (last viewed March 2025). "Epigastric" means "of or relating to the abdominal region." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "epigastric," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epigastric (last viewed March 2025). "Distress" means "pain or suffering affecting the body, a bodily part, or the mind." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "distress," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/distress (last viewed March 2025). "Considerable" means "large in extent or degree." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "considerable," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable (last viewed March 2025). "Severe" means "of a great degree." Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "severe," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe (last viewed March 2025).

Under the amended rating criteria, DC 7206, for GERD, provides a 10 percent rating where there is a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic. A 30 percent rating is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilation no more than two times per year. A 50 percent rating is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following: (1) dilation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement. An 80 percent rating, which is the highest available under these criteria, is warranted where there is a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7806; see also 89 Fed. Reg. 19735, 19744 (Mar. 20, 2024).

Under DC 7206, findings must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Id. Recurrent esophagal stricture is defined as the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved. Id. Refractory esophageal stricture is defined as the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals. Id. Section 4.112(a) defines substantial weight loss as involuntary loss greater than 20 percent of an individual's baseline weight sustained for three months with diminished quality of self-care or work tasks. 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a).

When applying rating criteria that do not expressly account for medication, such as the pre-amended version of DC 7346, the Board must rate the disability based on the symptoms without the ameliorating effects of any medication taken. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, at *12 (Vet. App. March 12, 2025) ("Jones [v. Shinseki] and McCaroll [v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016)] ... remain good law."). 

2. Evidence and Discussion

After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board finds that the severity of the Veteran's GERD, considered without the ameliorating effects of medication, warrants a rating of 60 percent under DC 7346. 

On active duty around 2004 or 2005, the Veteran was eating Swedish meatballs and found that he could not swallow them. He immediately sought treatment and was prescribed omeprazole, which he has taken continuously since. He reports being "much better on omeprazole," but even with the ameliorating effects of that medication, he still experiences dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain (December 2020, February 2021, and October 2021 VA examinations), sleep disturbances 4 or more times a year (March 2020, February 2021, and October 2022 VA examinations), nausea 4 or more times a year, and vomiting 2 or 4 or more times a year (February 2021 and October 2022 VA examinations). 

At the December 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported that "if he misses so much as one dose of his omeprazole[,] he gets really bad and his chest and throat will burn when laying down[,] and his throat will feel swollen[,] and he will not be able to swallow until he takes his medication and it has time to work." See December 28, 2020, VA GERD Examination. The examiner remarked, "Without his medication, his initial severe symptoms that are mentioned here will return almost immediately, indicating a clear continuation of his initial complaints and the severity of his GERD as worse." Id.

The rating criteria in DC 7346 do not expressly mention medication, and therefore a rating under these criteria must be assigned without consideration of the ameliorating effects of medication. Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63. Resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that without the ameliorating effects of omeprazole, the Veteran's GERD manifests in a combination of symptoms that are productive of severe impairment of health. Even with medication, the Veteran has dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbances, nausea, and vomiting; both the Veteran's statements and the medical evidence supports that these symptoms would be worse without medication. And the December 2020 examination report directly states that without medication, the Veteran experiences pain in and around the chest and a swelling sensation that prevents swallowing. These symptoms would produce impairment of health to "a great degree," i.e., severely. Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, "severe," accessed at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe (last viewed March 2025). The criteria are met for a 60 percent rating under DC 7346, the highest rating under these pre-amended criteria. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 (2023). 

A higher rating would only be available under the new DC 7206, which provides an 80 percent rating where there is a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube). 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7806. Those criteria are not met in this case, as none of the evidence shows that the Veteran has history of esophageal strictures that has been treated with surgical correction or a PEG tube.

Accordingly, a 60 percent rating, but no higher, for GERD is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.114, DC 7206, DC 7346 (2023). 

B. Other Specified Trauma and Stressor Related Disorder

The Veteran disagrees with the initial rating of 10 percent assigned for his other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, arguing that the rating should be 70 percent.

1. Legal Criteria

The Veteran's psychiatric disorder is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9410, for other specified anxiety disorder, which is in turn rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or where symptoms are controlled by continuous medication. Id.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). Id.

A 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such an unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent rating, the highest schedular rating, is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

In determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is a veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442. Nevertheless, all ratings in the General Rating Formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology, and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that a veteran's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms. A veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118. In deciding the case, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

2. Evidence

On January 2, 2020, the Veteran appeared at his VA primary care provider reporting mental health symptoms, and a mental health consult the same day recorded his reports of suicidal ideation the month prior, an angry and irritable mood ("lashes out" at home), becoming tearful at times, difficulty sleeping and nightmares, and difficulty relaxing and instead needing to "constantly [be] doing something." Mental status examination that day found him with normal speech and thoughts, normal insight and judgment, in a normal appearance, and denying any psychosis or mania. He declined therapy in favor of seeing if medication would be effective. See January 2, 2020, Mental Health Consult.

At a February 3, 2020, VA mental health consult, the Veteran reported the same symptoms continuing, including another episode of suicidal ideation the week prior. He had a depressed mood and affect. He was able to continue to perform adequately at work (having attended work earlier that day), had no marital discord, and did not report symptoms suggestive of cognitive impairment. On the day of the session, he was alert and oriented, with normal speech, normal motor activity, normal thoughts and judgment, and in clean appearance. A treatment plan was established to start taking a prescription medication, Venlafaxine. See February 3, 2020, VA Mental Health Consult. 

That medication worked for the Veteran, with a report at the next treatment session, on February 13, 2020, that "I am better, even my wife says so." He said his mood was "stable" and "has much improved with the help of the medication." The clinician remarked that the Veteran was "brighter, laughing and smiling during the interview." He reported "sleeping well and denies any nightmares." He was alert and oriented, had normal thoughts, speech, and judgment, was neatly groomed, and denied any suicidal ideations. He reported no symptoms suggestive of cognitive impairment and continued to function adequately at work. 

In April 2020, a VA clinician called the Veteran to see how he was coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Veteran said he was still working, though he was one of only two people still working at the tire plant. The Venlafaxine was a "lifesaver," he said, and he was doing much better with depression and anxiety. He denied suicidal ideation. See April 14, 2020, Mental Health Note.

The same day, the Veteran reported for a VA examination. See April 14, 2020, VA PTSD Examination. He explained that for 10 years he had had hypervigilance and anxiety that he was able to manage without difficulty. But in October 2019, he had started to have nightmares of dead people, to feel angry, and to have thoughts he was better off dead. Once he began taking Effexor (venlafaxine), he felt an "immediate improvement in mood" from the medication. At the time of the examination, the Veteran "reported no mood or behavior concerns since beginning Effexor," though he became "mildly irritable when his wife is 'nagging' him but [he] is able to cope since the Effexor." He lived with his wife of 21 years, his step-daughter, and step-daughter's twins. He denied any marital or family problems, though he reported that he had only a "few friends" and did not attend social gatherings. He continued to work at the tire company where had had been for 6 years, though due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was only him and an assistant that were at the factory. Before the pandemic, he worked alone; having to work alongside someone now caused "some frustration." Other than that, he had no occupational concerns. See April 14, 2020, VA PTSD Examination. 

On the day of the examination, the Veteran was alert and oriented, with normal speech, normal memory, good insight and judgment, a euthymic mood and congruent affect, a pleasant and cooperative attitude, no hallucinations or delusions, no suicidal or homicidal ideation, and well groomed. The examination report indicated that his only current symptom was anxiety. The examiner remarked that prior to beginning medication, the Veteran had symptoms including suicidal thinking; however, "[w]ith treatment of Effexor, Veteran's mood and behavior symptoms decreased and Veteran no longer had mood and behavior symptoms." See April 14, 2020, VA PTSD Examination.

At a May 5, 2020, VA mental telehealth session, the Veteran reported a "resurgence of intermittent anger outbursts," corroborated by his wife. This was "associated with episodic moderate depression, anxiety, and fragmented nocturnal change." On the day of the session, the Veteran was fully oriented, with normal speech, normal thoughts, normal insight and judgment, no difficulty with concentration or other symptoms suggestive of cognitive impairment, no mania, no change in energy level, no hallucinations, and no suicidal ideation. See May 5, 2020, VA Mental Health Telehealth Note.

In July 2020, the Veteran said, "I'm doing much better." He denied depression and reported his mood was stable. Sleep and energy levels were adequate, and the Veteran "seems to be functioning at his baseline." He was alert and oriented, with normal thoughts and speech, normal judgment and insight, no symptoms of cognitive impairment, no suicidal or homicidal ideation, and neatly groomed. See July 28, 2020, VA Mental Health Note. 

The Veteran submitted an August 12, 2020, evaluation by a private psychologist, Dr. J.E.M. The Veteran reported to Dr. J.E.M. that on most mornings, from the time of waking up he was depressed and unmotivated to perform even simple house chores. Though he was currently employed, he normally worked alone; "[h]e cannot tolerate being around other people," which Dr. J.E.M. said was a consistent "theme" throughout the evaluation. Outside of work, the Veteran was "basically reclusive" and stayed at home ("I just don't like being around people at all, I do not trust them"). His wife did all the shopping, and if he had to go out to, for example, a restaurant, he needed to be near an exit with his back against the wall, suggestive to Dr. J.E.M. of "some paranoia." See August 12, 2020, Dr. J.E.M. Evaluation.

At work, the Veteran had trouble focusing and concentrating "much of the time" and worked "under duress." He would start crying "for no reason at all" about 2 to 3 times a week. He also reported "explosive outbursts" 2 to 3 times a week. Dr. J.E.M. noted that while the Veteran "could understand and follow simple instructions" in the interview, "he is psychologically impaired and would not be able to respond favorably to supervision or interact cooperatively with coworkers on a sustained basis over a reasonable period of time." Moreover, "[h]e would have great difficulty completing tasks in a timely and acceptable manner on a sustained basis." See August 12, 2020, Dr. J.E.M. Evaluation.

On the day of Dr. J.E.M.'s evaluation, the Veteran was oriented in all spheres, had a depressed mood with sad affect, and appeared anxious from time to time. He was appropriately dressed and appeared to be clean with adequate hygiene. The Veteran stated that he had not had suicidal thoughts since he began taking Effexor. See August 12, 2020, Dr. J.E.M. Evaluation.

Another VA examination was provided in October 2020. The examiner noted the first VA examination in April 2020 and that "[the] Veteran stated that he was disappointed with his examiner, ... indicating that she spent less than 20 minutes with him overall." Moreover, "[s]ince that exam, the Veteran states there are significant changes in this area." The symptoms now reported were neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting), difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, flattened affect, suspiciousness, disturbances of motivation and mood, chronic sleep impairment, anxiety and depressed mood. On the day of the examination, the Veteran was oriented, showed no signs of significant cognitive impairment or psychosis, was anxious, and had a sad affect. The Veteran said his mood was "was alright til[l] now," as the discussion "caused anxiety and distress." He was dressed appropriately for the examination. See October 27, 2020, VA PTSD Examination.

At a November 2020 VA treatment session, the Veteran reported he was "doing pretty good." His mood was stable and he denied depression. Sleep and energy levels were adequate, and the Veteran "seem[ed] to be functioning at his baseline." He had no anxiety, mania, psychosis, or symptoms of cognitive impairment, and he denied suicidal ideation. See November 17, 2020, VA Mental Health Note.

The Veteran saw a mental health provider again in March 2021 and reported that he continued "doing good." He had recently been promoted to a supervisory position at work. He denied depression and reported a stable mood. He had no symptoms of any cognitive impairment. Overall, his symptoms "ha[d] subsided in intensity, frequency and burden." He was fully oriented, had normal speech and thoughts, normal judgment and insight, denied hallucinations, and denied suicidal ideation. See March 9, 2021, VA Mental Health Telehealth Note.

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) indicating that he had stopped working in December 2021. He included "PSTD" as one of the service-connected conditions that he believed prevented him from working. See June 2, 2022, VA Form 21-8940 ("I went to work I tried to do what they asked of me but I couldn't. The department I was assigned too had 3 floors lots of stairs to climb lots of heavy lifting just can't do the tasks I was asked to do."). 

Another VA examination was provided in October 2022. The Veteran still took Effexor "and feels it is still working." He was "only reporting occasional nightmares," without any other symptoms. He was not working, "as he feels he cannot stand long enough to work, due to his back." On the day of the examination, the Veteran was alert and oriented, pleasant and cooperative with a euthymic mood and congruent affect, had normal speech and normal thought processes, good insight and judgment, denied hallucinations or delusions, and denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. See October 15, 2022, VA PTSD Examination.

3. Discussion

After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms significantly changed throughout the period on review, warranting separate ratings for separate periods of time (also called "staged" ratings). See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). An initial rating of 70 percent may be granted until February 13, 2020; a rating in excess of 10 percent on and after February 13, 2020, and prior to August 12, 2020, is not warranted; and, a rating of 70 percent, but no higher, is warranted on and after August 12, 2020.

a. An initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, prior to February 13, 2020, is granted.

When the Veteran first sought mental health treatment on January 2, 2020, he reported symptoms including suicidal ideation, lashing out at home, becoming tearful, and nightmares that interfered with sleep. Those symptoms persisted through January 2020 and into February 2020, with the Veteran reporting on February 3, 2020, that he had another episode of suicidal ideation the week prior. 

Suicidal ideation is a significant symptom that alone can create occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017). In the Veteran's case, the suicidal ideation during this time frame, in combination with his other reported symptoms, establishes a disability picture more nearly approximating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.130, General Rating Formula; id.

An initial rating higher than 70 percent, however, is not warranted. The higher rating of 100 percent requires evidence of total occupational and social impairment, but here the Veteran continued to work throughout the period and therefore was not totally occupationally impaired. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, General Rating Formula.

An initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, prior to February 13, 2020, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.126, 4.130, DC 9410. 

b. A rating in excess of 10 percent on and after February 13, 2020, and prior to August 12, 2020, is denied. 

After the Veteran was prescribed Effexor at his February 3, 2020, treatment session, he returned on February 13, 2020, and both he and his wife reported that he was "better," with a "much improved" and stable mood, "sleeping well" and denying nightmares, "brighter, laughing and smiling," without symptoms suggestive of cognitive impairment, still employed, and denying suicidal ideation.

The Veteran continued to report the effectiveness of his medication and the resulting improvement in symptoms. The April 2020 VA examination asked him about the history of his condition, and he reported that the Effexor caused an "immediate improvement in mood" and continued to be effective. At the April 2020 VA treatment session and VA examination, he reported only experiencing mild irritability ("when his wife is 'nagging' him") but being able to regulate that symptom. He continued to work, experiencing just "some frustration" that the COVID-19 pandemic required him to work alongside someone else. 

He reported the same in July 2020. At a treatment session that month, he again said he was "doing much better," denied depression, reported a stable mood with adequate sleep and energy levels, and was not found to have any signs of cognitive impairment. He denied suicidal ideation and was neatly groomed. His provider remarked that he seemed to be functioning at baseline.

The one outlier to this disability picture is the Veteran's report in May 2020 of a resurgence of "intermittent" anger outbursts and "episodic" moderate depression, anxiety, and sleep problems. However, given that the Veteran then reported in July 2020 a disability picture in accord with the disability picture from late February 2020 and April 2020, the Board finds that the symptoms reported at the treatment session in May 2020 were transient symptoms, and not of a severity, frequency, and duration that would create occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.126, 4.130, General Rating Formula. Rather, the overall disability picture during this time frame reflects that the Veteran's symptoms were controlled by continuous medication, or manifested in transient symptoms decreasing work efficiency. Id.

Accordingly, a rating in excess of 10 percent on and after February 13, 2020, and prior to August 12, 2020, is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.126, 4.130, DC 9410. 

c. A rating of 70 percent, but no higher, on and after August 12, 2020, is granted.

The Board last finds that the 70 percent rating, which is currently assigned from August 31, 2020, may be granted from August 12, 2020, but that a rating higher than 70 percent is not warranted any time after.

During the period on review as a part of this claim, on August 31, 2020, the Veteran submitted a new claim for an increased rating for his psychiatric disorder, which resulted in a November 2020 rating decision granting a 70 percent rating from August 31, 2020, the date of the claim. (Recall that this decision is not the one for which review has been continuously pursued in this Board appeal; rather, it is the first rating decision granting service connection and assigning the initial rating that is on review.) As the November 2020 rating decision noted, the Veteran submitted a psychiatric evaluation from Dr. J.E.M. that alleged a significant worsening of the Veteran's current mental health symptoms, including a reclusiveness, distrust for others, problems concentrating and focusing "much of the time" at work, and anger and crying outbursts. Dr. J.E.M.'s evaluation is dated August 12, 2020, and therefore the Board finds that beginning on this date, the evidence establishes that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder created occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 

The Board further finds, however, that a rating higher than 70 percent is not warranted at any time on or after August 12, 2020. Occupationally, the evidence indicates the Veteran may have had problems working with others, and he asserted on his VA Form 21-8940 that he was unemployable in part due to his psychiatric disorder; however, the evidence also shows that the Veteran had performed well enough at work to earn a promotion to a supervisory position in March 2021, cutting against a finding of total occupational impairment. The evidence regarding social impairment is clear that the Veteran was not totally socially impaired, as he continued to maintain a relationship with his wife and some family members. Since the evidence does not establish total occupational and social impairment, a higher rating would not be warranted at any point during this period. (The Board also notes that the Veteran through his attorney has never argued for a 100 percent rating, and instead has centrally sought a 70 percent rating during the earlier part of the entire period on review.) 

A rating of 70 percent, but no higher, on and after August 12, 2020, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.126, 4.130, DC 9410. 

C. Hypertension

The Veteran appeals the decision denying an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension. He has continuously pursued this claim since the August 4, 2020, rating decision granting an increased rating of 10 percent. 

1. Legal Criteria

The Veteran's hypertension is rated under DC 7101. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. Under DC 7101, a 20 percent rating is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure is predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 120 or more. A 60 percent rating, the highest available under these criteria, is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 8101.

2. Evidence and Discussion 

Medical records across the period on review show the following blood pressure readings:

123 (systolic)/80 (diastolic) on June 7, 2022; 

123/83 on December 21, 2021;

143/84 and 150/99 on December 17, 2020;

132/88 and 143/95 on June 12, 2020; 

155/100, 155/103, and 158/102 at a March 21, 2020, VA examination;

148/89 on February 13, 2020; and, 

142/92 on February 3, 2020.

Based on this evidence, a higher rating is not warranted, as the Veteran's diastolic pressure is not predominantly 110 or more and his systolic pressure is not predominantly 200 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 8101.

The Board acknowledges request from the Veteran's attorney in the June 14, 2024, argument submitted with the NOD because "the Veteran states that his condition has worsened." However, the Board nowhere finds an assertion from the Veteran that his condition has worsened, and to the extent that the attorney specifically intended to newly relate that statement on the Veteran's behalf, it would be new evidence that is not reviewable under the Direct Review docket elected on their NOD. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. The Veteran and his attorney offer no other argument regarding a failure to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that would justify remanding this claim. See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension are not met, and the claim is therefore denied. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 8101.

D. TDIU

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU was explicitly raised during the pendency of the claims adjudicated herein. See June 2, 2022, VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability; Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 448, 449 (2009). In his June 2, 2022, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran contended that he was entitled to a TDIU due, at least in part to, his service-connected "PTSD," tinnitus, and both knees as well as a lower back disability, for which there was a pending claim for service connection. Thus, it is part and parcel of the Veteran's claim for an increased initial rating for his PTSD. Once the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is at issue as part of a claim for an increased rating, a veteran does not to appeal a denial of that issue by the AOJ for it to be in or remain in appellate status; therefore, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is properly before the Board. See Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356 (2018); Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373 (2019).

1. Legal Criteria

A TDIU may be assigned when the claimant is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. The service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue will be addressed in both instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), (b).

For consideration of entitlement to a TDIU on a schedular basis, if there is only one service-connected disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Entitlement to a total disability rating must be based solely on the impact and severity of the veteran's service-connected disabilities on their ability to secure and follow substantially gainful employment. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; see also Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993).

While the general rating schedule is based on the "average impairment in earning capacity caused by a disability," entitlement to a TDIU is based on the individual's particular circumstances. Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 452. A claim for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability asks for a TDIU because of 'subjective' factors, to include the Veteran's education, training, and work history, that the 'objective' rating does not consider. See Vettese v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 31, 34-35 (1994).

In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in § 4.16(b) is defined as to include two components: one economic and one noneconomic. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) determined by the United States Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The non-economic component includes consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the Veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue, provided that discussion of any factor is only necessary if the evidence raises it. Id. 

Marginal employment may exist, on a fact found basis, where the applicant's income exceeds the poverty threshold but is in a "protected environment," defined as a "lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 122 (2024). The Board must consider whether the employment is shielded, at least partially, from the competitive market, looking to the extent the applicant's income exceeds the poverty threshold, the employer's intent in employing the applicant, and applicant's receipt of workplace accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Id. 

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to secure or follow employment. Ultimately, the central inquiry for entitlement to a TDIU is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The ultimate question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; rather, that determination is for the adjudicator. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

2. Evidence and Discussion

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability) that his disabilities affected full-time employment and he became too disabled to work on December 21, 2021, his last day of employment. See June 2, 2022, VA Form 21-8940. He reported working 40 hours as a maintenance technician in December 2021 for a period just over two weeks during which he earned approximately $690. Prior to that, from July 2014 to November 2021, he reported working 40 hours per week as a facilities reliability technician earning approximately $6,500 per month. 

In terms of his education and training, the Veteran reported having a high school level education and additional training as a boiler in October 2020.

As noted above, in March 2021, during a VA appointment, the Veteran reported having been recently promoted to a supervisory position at work. See March 9, 2021, VA Mental Health Telehealth Note.

In a March 2025 rating decision, VA granted a TDIU from December 22, 2021, the first day following the Veteran's last day of full-time employment due to the physical and mental impairments stemming from the combination of his service-connected disabilities. 

After reviewing all of the evidence, prior to December 22, 2021, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU is not warranted as the Veteran was substantially and gainfully employed. There is no evidence of record, to include the Veteran's lay reports suggesting that he was employed in a marginal capacity prior to December 22, 2021. Moreover, his promotion in March 2021, to a supervisory position indicates that he was not shielded from competition in the employment market.

Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU prior to December 22, 2021, is denied.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

III. Service Connection

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral shoulder and bilateral elbow conditions. He contends that they are due to wear and tear from service, including physical training, working with the full weight of body armor and combat load, patrolling with his service weapon, loading and unloading heavy machine guns, crawling on the ground to work on radar installations, and stop-and-drop exercises. See January 20, 2022, Statement in Support of Claim; January 20, 2022, VA Form 20-0995.

VA medical examinations were provided in May 2022, at which the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral shoulder strains and bilateral elbow bursitis. The examiner opined that none of the conditions were related to service on the sole basis that "[n]o provided service records suggest that [the conditions were] incurred during service." See June 9, 2022, VA Etiology Opinions. This opinion is inadequate, because the examiner needed to address the Veteran's contentions about whether the conditions may be due to wear and tear from his service duties. See, e.g., Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008). 

Because these errors existed at the time of the decision on review, remand is justified. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The Board by this remand makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral shoulder strains. It is left to the clinician's discretion whether a new examination is needed.

The clinician must address whether the Veteran's right shoulder strain and/or left shoulder strain is directly related to service, to include wear and tear from activities such as physical training, working with the full weight of body armor and combat load, patrolling with the service weapon, loading and unloading heavy machine guns, crawling on the ground to work on radar installations, and stop-and-drop exercises?

2. Obtain an opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral elbow bursitis. It is left to the clinician's discretion whether a new examination is needed.

The clinician must address whether the Veteran's right elbow bursitis and/or left elbow bursitis is directly related to service, to include wear and tear from activities such as physical training, working with the full weight of body armor and combat load, patrolling with the service weapon, loading and unloading heavy machine guns, crawling on the ground to work on radar installations, and stop-and-drop exercises?
