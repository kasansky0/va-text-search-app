ISSUE

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for sinusitis.

ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating of 50 percent for sinusitis is GRANTED.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's sinusitis manifested in near constant symptoms of headache, pain, discharge, and crusting during the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for 50 percent disability rating for sinusitis prior to June 6, 2024, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1997 to September 2005. The matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 supplemental claim rating decision issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the disability evaluation assigned for service-connected sinusitis, most recently addressed in a March 2024 rating decision. In April 2024, the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim for an increased rating based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is in turn based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the evaluations to be assigned to the various disabilities.

Where, as here, the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability rating following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.

If there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

If different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

In accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes.

Additionally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several Diagnostic Codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The General Rating Formula for sinusitis is listed at 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6510-6514. Under the General Rating Formula, a non-compensable rating is assigned where the condition is detected by X-ray only. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6510-6514.

A 10 percent rating is assigned when there are "one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting." Id.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when there are "three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting." Id.

A 50 percent rating is assigned following "radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries." Id.

An incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513 at Note 1.

The criteria for rating sinusitis are conjunctive, meaning that each element of the criteria is needed to meet the requirements for the specified evaluation. See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360 (2007); see also Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991) (use of the conjunctive "and" in a statutory provision means that all the conditions listed in the provision must be met).

Relevant Facts

The Veteran contends that he should receive a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected sinusitis. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding the severity of his disability in August 2023. At the VA examination, the Veteran stated:

He is experiencing chronic nasal congestion and facial pain in his forehead and under his eyes for years. He reports tenderness with palpation of his facial sinuses. He reports chronic postnasal drip. He reports that he has been advised to use nasal saline because he doesn't want to use medication. He experienced increased nasal mucus. He reports yellow nasal mucus. He feels congested and has decreased ability to breathe through his nose. He reports he has been told that he is experiencing sinus pressure headaches. He was advised to use a Netti pot to clear out his nose. He reports that when he served in Iraq, he was NCO over sanitation and he oversaw the burn pits and the port-a-potties. He has not not required prolonged antibiotic prescription. He prefers to avoid antibiotic therapy.

See August 2023 VA Examination. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's diagnosis is "chronic sinusitis."

Despite the Veteran's contention that he has been experiencing symptoms such as headaches, pain, tenderness, discharge, and crusting for years, and the VA examiner's own finding that the Veteran's sinusitis is "chronic," the VA examiner marked that the Veteran experiences "episodes of sinusitis," instead of "near constant sinusitis."

Analysis

A disability rating of 50 percent for sinusitis is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis during the period on appeal. The evidence indicates that the Veteran has experienced symptoms of sinusitis "for years" prior to filing his claim for disability. The VA examiner further noted that the Veteran's symptoms are "chronic," indicating that the Veteran's symptoms meet the requirement of "near constant sinusitis" required by the diagnostic code.

Although the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms were episodic instead of near constant, the Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Therefore, because the VA examiner's ultimate findings are directly at odds with the Veteran's credible and competent lay statements and with his own findings of the chronic nature of the condition at issue, creating an internal inconsistency in the August 2023 VA examination report, the Board awards no probative weight to those findings. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (medical opinion based on inaccurate factual premise may properly be rejected as non-probative).

Considering this evidence, the symptoms of the Veteran's sinusitis most closely approximate the criteria for a 50 percent disability rating, the maximum disability rating available under DC 6513.

The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all diagnostic codes that are potentially applicable when evaluating the Veteran's sinusitis. Scharfrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991). However, the Veteran has been diagnosed with, and is in receipt of service connection for, sinusitis, a condition that is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) ("When a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy"). Therefore, there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively in favor of granting a disability rating of 50 percent for sinusitis.  The appeal is granted.
