ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 and 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1994 to November 2002.

Via the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service connection for tinnitus.

i.	Legal criteria.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

If a veteran has a current, chronic disability listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), a nexus can be presumed if there is evidence of chronic disease manifested as such during active service; or chronic disease manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period after active service (usually 1 year); or if there is competent, credible, and persuasive evidence of continuity of symptomatology since active service. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

The presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuity of symptomatology" after service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) have been interpreted as an alternative to service connection only for the specific chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the "chronic" in service and "continuous" post-service symptom presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) only apply to "chronic" diseases at 3.309(a)).

ii.	Facts and analysis.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus.

The first element of service connection, a present diagnosis, weighs in favor of the claim. The Veteran is competent to diagnose his own tinnitus. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2014) (Tinnitus is an inherently subjective disability and is therefore readily capable of lay diagnosis.). Moreover, in the Veteran's compensation and pension examination from November 2023, the examiner notes that the Veteran reports symptoms of tinnitus and describes them as "a tuning fork that never shuts off." Accordingly, the first element of service connection is met.

The second element of service connection, an in-service event or incurrence, also weighs in favor of the claim. A service treatment record from April 2000 documents the Veteran's in-service complaint of "ringing in the ears." Accordingly, the Veteran's onset of tinnitus symptoms dating back until at least 2000 satisfies the second element of service connection.

The third element of service connection, medical nexus, is presumed. Tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system-which is a chronic disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). The Veteran's symptoms manifested to a compensable degree during service. Accordingly, medical nexus is presumed via the chronic disease presumption. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3).

The Board acknowledges that a clinician opined against medical nexus. However, the clinician based the negative medical nexus opinion on the mistaken assumption that the Veteran's tinnitus symptoms had their onset more than one year after the Veteran's separation. The Veteran provides additional context on this misunderstanding concerning the date of onset in statements in support of claim from February 2023 and March 2023. Moreover, the Veteran's contention that the onset of symptoms happened during service is supported by symptoms noted in his service treatment records.

Considering the foregoing, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his military service. The Board resolves any doubts in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, service connection for tinnitus is granted.
