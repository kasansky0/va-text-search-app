REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for left hip replacement is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to June 1983.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of left hip replacement, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for left hip replacement is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his left hip replacement is due to his fall during a training exercise.  See April 2024 VA Claim.

In a July 2024 VA examination, the examiner opined that "it is less likely than not that the claimed condition is due to service as there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of left hip arthroplasty and military service."  He further reasoned that without chronicity, "a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology."  The Board finds this opinion inadequate as it relies solely on lack of service and post-service treatment records.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2006) (the lack of medical evidence in service does not constitute substantive negative evidence); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that lay statements regarding medical symptoms may not be rejected simply because they are not accompanied by contemporaneous medical records).

Thus, while the Board regrets further delay, a remand is necessary to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. See Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 12 (2001) (emphasizing the Board's duty to return inadequate examination reports); Hicks v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 417, 421 (1995) (inadequate medical evaluation frustrates judicial review).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed erectile dysfunction.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) Opine whether the Veteran's left hip replacement is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service, to include his fall "during a training exercise."

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinion rendered.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
