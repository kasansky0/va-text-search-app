ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic kidney disease is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a pituitary disability, diagnosed as pituitary adenoma, is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for acromegaly is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's chronic kidney disease is etiologically related to his time in active service.

2. The Veteran's pituitary adenoma is etiologically related to his time in active service.

3. The Veteran's acromegaly is etiologically related to his time in active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to establish service connection for chronic kidney disease have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria to establish service connection for a pituitary disability, diagnosed as pituitary adenoma, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria to establish service connection for acromegaly have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1972 to January 1995.  He appeals a February 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denying service connection for acromegaly, a kidney condition, and pituitary cancer.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Service Connection

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that a disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, pituitary adenoma and acromegaly and was exposed to Agent Orange during military service; the Board is bound by such findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c); February 2024 AOJ rating decision.  

Accordingly, the fundamental factual question in this case is whether the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents in service caused his chronic kidney disease, pituitary adenoma and acromegaly.

As to chronic kidney disease, Dr. C.K. a radiation oncologist, concluded that it is at least as likely as not that it was caused by his exposure to herbicide agents.  See August 2024 Dr. C.K. medical opinion (emphasis added).  In coming to that conclusion, Dr. C.K. personally reviewed the Veteran's file, and based his opinion on peer-reviewed references.  A VA examiner came to an opposite conclusion.  See January 2024 VA medical opinion.  However, the reasoning for that opinion, in its entirety, was as follows: "[t]here are no medical studies to date establishing an association between Agent Orange exposure and chronic kidney disease."  Id.  Nevertheless, the VA examiner did not conduct a risk factor analysis and was contradicted by a study cited by Dr. C.K. showing exposure to dioxin induces a higher rate of chronic kidney disease.  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the August 2024 medical opinion of radiation oncologist Dr. C.K. in this particular case.

Dr. C.K. also explained that the Veteran had no personal risk factors for pituitary adenoma and acromegaly, and that dioxin belongs to a class of chemicals known to alter thyroid hormone function.  Id.  An epidemiologic study of Vietnam Veterans shows that exposure to herbicide agents confers a 43 percent higher rate for pituitary adenoma.  On this basis, Dr. C.K. concluded it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's pituitary adenoma and acromegaly were caused by his exposure to herbicide agents.  Id.  A VA examiner agreed with Dr. C.K.s conclusion.  See January 2024 VA medical opinion.

As a result, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding that, in this particular case, the Veteran's chronic kidney disease, pituitary adenoma and acromegaly are related to herbicide agent exposure in service.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for chronic kidney disease, pituitary adenoma and acromegaly is warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
