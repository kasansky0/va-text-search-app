DOCKET NO. 240827-467387
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

An effective date for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prior to January 3, 2020, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to VA's January 3, 2020, receipt of the Veteran's intent to file, there were no pending requests for service connection for PTSD that were unadjudicated.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to January 3, 2020, for service connection for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1987 to July 1991. His service decorations include the Southwest Asia Service Medal and the Kuwait Liberation Medal.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board is aware that the Veteran's August 2024 NOD identified a November 2023 rating decision which proposed to the effective dates for his increased PTSD and headache ratings and grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) and dependents' educational assistance (DEA. However, as the November 2023 rating decision was a proposal of the change in effective dates and not an adjudication, the November 2023 rating decision as to those issues is not an appealable decision. As such, there is no question of law or fact currently on appeal regarding those issues or the November 2023 rating decision. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105. The Veteran was notified of the unappealable nature of a proposed rating decision in November 2024 correspondence. Thus, the issues identified in the November 2023 rating decision are not on appeal to the Board in the instant matter.

VA did issue a December 2024 rating decision which implemented the proposed new effective dates for the Veteran's PTSD and headache ratings and assigment of the effective dates for SMC and DEA benefits. Thus, the Veteran has one year from the issuance of the December 2024 rating decision to perfect an appeal of the effective dates of his increased ratings for PTSD and headaches and the assigment of the effective dates for his SMC and DEA. Until such time as the Veteran files an NOD regarding the December 2024 rating decision, those issues are not on appeal to the Board.

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the day following separation from active service or the date of entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

If a Veteran submits to VA an intent to file (ITF), VA will furnish the Veteran with the appropriate form to file their claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If an application is filed within one year of the intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

PTSD

In this matter, VA received an ITF on January 3, 2020, and subsequently received the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD on January 1, 2021. An April 2021 rating decision granted service connection for the Veteran's PTSD and assigned a January 3, 2020, effective date. The September 2023 rating decision on appeal affirmed that effective date. 

The law is well settled that the date of receipt of a claim is the date on which a claim, information, or evidence is received by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1. The Board has no authority to grant claims on an equitable basis; instead, the Board is constrained to follow specific provisions of law. 38 U.S.C. § 7104. Here, there is no evidence that the Veteran sought service connection for PTSD prior to his January 2020 ITF. There are no unadjudicated claims for service connection for PTSD outstanding which would serve as an appropriate effective date for PTSD prior to January 3, 2020. Indeed, the Veteran's January 2021 Fully Developed Claim for service connection for PTSD noted that his claim was for a new claimed disability. Furthermore, the Veteran has not identified a date upon which he believes service connection for PTSD is warranted.

As such, and based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim. Accordingly, as the persuasive evidence of record is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application, and the claim must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
