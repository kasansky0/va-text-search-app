DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection of right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis disability onset in and resulted from military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection of right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1989 to October 1993.

Procedural History

The present appeal originates from an initial disability claim received on May 13, 2022, seeking service connection of a right knee condition.  See May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In a July 2022, Rating Decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied service connection of a right knee condition upon finding that the Veteran lacked a current diagnosis of a knee disability.

In January 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request Supplemental Claim requesting reconsideration of the July 2022 Rating Decision.  In an April 2024 Rating Decision, the RO found new and relevant evidence had been submitted sufficient to warrant reconsideration of the claim but again denied service connection for the Veteran's right knee, specifically of right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis.

In January 2024, the Veteran again filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim requesting reconsideration of the February 2023 Rating Decision.  In a February 2023 Rating Decision, the RO reopened the claim, but again denied service connection of right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis.  In the April 2024 agency decision, the RO concluded the Veteran's right knee disability was medically the result of confirmed in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

In a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency decision on the issue on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection requires evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated in service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Analysis

The Veteran contends that he initially injured his right knee during an active-duty training exercise and experienced progressive worsening as a result of repetitive and strenuous use climbing up and down magazines and other physically demanding aspects of his role in service.  See May 2022, January 2023, and January 2024 VA Forms 21-4138.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the first two elements of service connection have been established.  The record establishes that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis (osteoarthritis).  See March 2024 VA Knee and Lower Leg Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); Private Treatment Records.

Additionally, the Veteran submitted detailed lay and buddy statements explaining that around 1992, he fell on his knee when he caught a bomb (Aviation Ordnance MOS).  See March 2024 VA DBQ; May 2022, January 2023, and January 2024 VA Forms 21-4138, and January 2024 Buddy Statement.  He further reported that he repeatedly hit his knees while in confined spaces and climbing stairs on the ship as part of his routine duties.  Several years after separation, he underwent diagnostic imaging confirmed osteoarthritis and has had multiple steroid injections in his right knee.  See November 2013 Private Orthopedic Records (confirming arthritis and treatment with injections).

Based on the Veteran's and his spouse's credible statements, in conjunction with the nature and circumstances incident to his military service in the U.S. Navy, the Board finds the evidence establishes that the onset of his right knee condition occurred in-service.  Having established a current disability and in-service incurrence, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's current right knee disability has a nexus to his military service.

As to element three, a medical nexus, the March 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) because osteoarthritis occurs due to wear and tear of the cartilage at the joints from aging or intense use of the joints during sports, exercise, or other activities and there is no evidence to attribute his right knee disability to TERA.  The VA examiner further noted that there is insufficient objective evidence to warrant a right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis condition; therefore, a diagnosis has not been rendered.  In an ironic twist, the same VA examiner rendered the diagnosis of right knee joint osteoarthritis.

The Board assigns no probative weight to the VA medical opinion as it is internally inconsistent, failed to address the Veteran's contentions regarding onset of and continuation of symptoms from active service to present, and provided no medical explanation for the presence of the diagnosed disability.  Based on the incompleteness of the opinions, the Board accords the VA medical opinion no probative weight.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (a medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21Vet. App.120, 124-25 (2007) (a mere conclusory opinion is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision as to the weight to assign to a medical opinion).

In a January 2023 private medical opinion, the Veteran's provider opined that given the Veteran's complaints of an in-service right knee injury and his statements reflecting chronicity of symptoms to the present, it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current right knee condition is due to, related to, a progression of, and/or a continuation of his right knee injury and pain initially experienced in active service.  As noted above, the Veteran has credibly stated that he experiences chronic pain in his right knee with reduced mobility and limitation to his daily activities.

The Board finds the private medical opinion and statements of the Veteran and his spouse regarding in-service onset and persistent symptomology of his right knee competent and credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  Based on the Veteran's statements that he has experienced chronic right knee pain and continued treatment since service, plus the medical evidence reflecting a long-term condition, the Board finds that a nexus is established.  In sum, the Board finds positive evidence of a link between the Veteran's in-service right knee injury and his current right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776; see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  As such, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral and compartment arthrosis is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
