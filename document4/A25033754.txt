REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left elbow disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right elbow disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in active-duty service with the Army from January 1992 to September 1996.

This matter is on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision; as such, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Veteran submitted an April 2024 10182 form selecting the Direct Review option.

The Board notes that in the April 2024 10182 form, the Veteran attempts to appeal an "April 16, 2024" decision relating to a number of issues to include bilateral elbow; forearm; major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder; and limited motion of the wrist to include arthritis.

Review of the record shows an April 16, 2024 VA letter informing the Veteran that VA regulations required filing the proper form to review any claims in response to an April 2024 VA 21-526EZ claim relating to the issues described in the April 2024 10182 form. 

Review of the record one year prior to the Veteran's April 2024 10182 submission show only a February 2024 rating decision that adjudicated entitlement to service connection for a left and right elbow disability, but there are no other rating decisions during this period that have adjudicated the other issues as described in the Veteran's April 2024 10182.

As such, the Board interprets the Veteran's April 2024 10182 as appealing the February 2024 rating decision adjudicating entitlement to service connection for a left and right elbow disability and has recharacterized the issues on appeal before the Board to reflect this.

The Board notes that favorable findings were made during the pendency of the appeal to include finding the Veteran with exposure to chemicals during service. As such, the Board is bound by these favorable findings. AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, ยง 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

The Board finds remand is warranted for development.

In an August 2017 VA examination, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a bilateral elbow strain. The Veteran reported left arm pain from the wrist to elbow; and described functional impairment where he was unable to open tops with his right hand or lift more than 7 to 10 pounds with the left arm. 

The examiner did not provide an etiology opinion on the Veteran's bilateral elbow strain in relation to service.

In a January 2024 VA examination, the Veteran demonstrated limitation in range of motion (ROM) in both elbows to include reporting pain in all motions; the Veteran also reported the same functional impairment as described in the August 2017 VA examination.

The examiner did not find a diagnosis relating to the Veteran's claimed left and right elbow. The examiner gave a negative etiology opinion and found there was a "lack of substantial evidence to support a nexus between diagnosis of normal elbow and service" and that a post-service injury was the more likely cause.

However, the examiner does not address or reconcile the August 2017 VA examination diagnosis for a bilateral elbow strain.

The Board also notes the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, which stated that even in the absence of a presently diagnosed condition, pain can cause functional impairment, and that in that situation, "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability. " Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). 

Here, the Veteran's reported symptoms and diagnoses could have served as a current disability for service connection during the period of the appeal the disability was present. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 322-23 (2007) (the fact that a disability has resolved during the appeal period does not preclude a finding of service connection for the disability).

As such, the Board finds remand is warranted to obtain an adequate opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Return the claims file to the VA examiner who provided the January 2024 VA examination and medical opinion on the on the Veteran's claimed left and right elbow disability, if available, for clarification and addendum opinion. If that examiner is not available, the claims file should be provided to another physician to obtain the requested opinion.

After review of the claims file, the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

(a.) Please identify all current right and left elbow disabilities. "Current" is defined as any condition identified since the filing of the claim (or approximate thereto) to the present. "Disability" includes any diagnosable conditions as well as pain or symptoms that are not diagnosable but, nonetheless, cause functional impairment. 

(b.) All diagnostic findings to include the diagnoses made in the August 2017 VA examination must be reconciled with conflicting evidence in the record. If a previously documented diagnosis is deemed incorrect or obsolete (i.e., subsumed by a more appropriate diagnosis), the examiner must explain why.

(c.) For any diagnosed left elbow disability, is it at least as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent or greater) that the identified left elbow disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service?

(d.) For any diagnosed right elbow disability, is it at least as likely as not (i.e., probability of 50 percent or greater) that the identified right elbow disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service?

(e.) The examiner is also advised that the Veteran is competent to report the Veteran's in-service events and treatment, and the Veteran's symptoms and history; and such reports and assertions must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions. If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, the examiner must provide a reason for doing so.

(f.) The examiner should provide a complete rationale for any opinions provided, and if the examiner is unable to provide any opinion request, then the examiner should state so and why.
