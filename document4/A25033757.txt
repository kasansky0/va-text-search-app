REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Army National Guard from June 2016 to January 2017, from January 2021 to February 2021, and from November 2021 to December 2022, and has additional periods of active and inactive duty service. See December 2023 Military Personnel Record. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Specifically, the February 2024 rating decision denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea; and the March 2024 rating decision denied service connection for an adjustment disorder, left and right knee disability, low back disability, right hip disability, and irritable bowel syndrome. In May 2024, the Veteran appealed both rating decisions, and he selected a direct review docket on his Notice of Disagreement (NOD). See May 2024 VA Form 10182. 

APPLICABLE EVIDENTIARY WINDOW

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decisions on the issues on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the Veteran files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Veteran has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The Veteran is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. See Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). 

Service connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

Service connection can also be established for a disability due to a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA). See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (2), (22), (24), 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (d), 3.6(a), (c), 3.303; Harris v. West, 13 Vet. App. 509, 511 (2000); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995). "Active duty for training" is defined, in part, as full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes, or full-time duty performed by members of the National Guard of any State under 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505, or the prior corresponding provisions of law. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c). Most commonly, this refers to the two weeks of annual training that each National Guardsman must perform each year. It can also refer to the Guardsman's initial period of training. 

Similarly, service connection can be established for disability due to injury, but not disease, incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of inactive duty training (INACDUTRA), or from an acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or cerebrovascular accident which occurred during INACDUTRA. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (2), (23), (24); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (d), 3.6(a), (d). The term "inactive duty training" is defined as duty (other than full-time duty) performed by a member of the National Guard of any State under 38 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505, or the prior corresponding provisions of law. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d)(4). Most commonly, this refers to the twelve weekend drills (each of which is usually divided into four, four-hour periods drills) that each National Guardsman must perform each month. These drills are deemed to be part-time training.

When a claim is based on a period of National Guard service, it must be shown that the individual concerned became disabled (or died) as a result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty (during federalized National Guard service). See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010). Otherwise, the period would not qualify as "active military, naval, or air service" and the claimant would not achieve "veteran status" for purposes of that claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (2)-(24). A member of the National Guard serves in the federal military only when formally called into the military service of the United States. At all other times, a member of the National Guard serves soles as a member of the state militia under the command of a state governor. 

To have basic eligibility as a veteran based on a period of duty as a member of a state National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service (i.e., Federalized). See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c), (d); Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 57 (2007). Thus, a member of the National Guard holds a status as a member of either the federal military or the state militia, and he/she can never be a member of both at the same time. Id.; see also Perpich v. Dept. of Defense, 496 U.S. 334 (1990). As a result, only the Veteran's active-duty service, federalized National Guard service, or ACDUTRA/INACDUTRA periods qualify for the purpose of VA compensation benefits.

With respect to direct service connection, to substantiate a claim there must be evidence of (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal connection between the disease or injury in service and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for IBS.

The Veteran contends that his IBS is related to his service. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. Specifically, the Veteran indicated that the IBS was caused by "eating military provided food in a field environment that also gave me H. Pylori which then turned into IBS." Id. 

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not reveal that he received a diagnosis of either helicobacter pylori or IBS during his service. See September 2023 STRs. However, from September 2021 to October 2022, he was prescribed medications for stomach spasms and acid reflux, and during the November 2022 separation examination, he endorsed stomach pain. Id. 

Private treatment record from United Digestive shows that he was diagnosed with IBS by a private physician in September 2021. See October 2023 Private Treatment Record. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination, at which time the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of IBS. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. When asked about the medical history, the Veteran reported that his disability started with "contaminate food while at annual training in 2016, with stomach cramping and constant watery stools." Id. Ultimately, the January 2024 VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion on direct service connection indicating that the IBS is a chronic gastrointestinal disability that is associated with cramping, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. See January 2024 VA Opinion. 

In February 2024, the AOJ requested the examiner to clarify the positive nexus opinion in light of the lack of a diagnosis of IBS during active-duty service. See February 2024 VA Opinion. At that time, the VA examiner indicated that while the IBS diagnosis was offered after active-duty service, the Veteran was not seen for a gastrointestinal condition examination while on active duty, and that he reported the onset of his symptoms in 2016 while on active duty. See February 2024 VA Opinion. 

Here, the Veteran is competent to report gastrointestinal symptoms, to include stomach pain, cramping, and diarrhea. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Moreover, the Veteran reported starting to experience these symptoms during a period of active duty for training (ADT) and contracting a disease as a result. Therefore, such service will be considered active service for VA compensation purposes. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24)(B). 

In light of the above, the Board finds the VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her January 2024 and February 2024 opinions a high probative weight considering the opinions correctly identified the Veteran's periods of active-duty service, reflected a review of the Veteran's record, and they were supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's medical treatment history. 

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for IBS. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for IBS is granted. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

The Veteran claims that his right knee disability is related to his service. Specifically, on his claim the Veteran indicated that "carrying weighted rucks and walking in combat boots with little to no arch support" caused his disability, and that the "dislocation of my SI joint caused my spine to twist and to overcompensate on my dominant leg." See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. 

A review of the Veteran's STRs shows that at the September 2014 entrance examination, the Veteran did not have a right knee disability or symptoms thereof. See September 2023 and January 2024 STR.  During active-duty service, the Veteran was seen for right knee pain several times, to include in July 2016, August 2016, September 2016, October 2016, November 2016, December 2016, and January 2017, complaining that marching and running long distance caused right knee pain. Id. As a result, he was given a knee brace and put on profile in September 2016, which was extended until December 2016. Id. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his knee disability. At that time, the VA examiner diagnosed him with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. With respect to the medical history, the Veteran reported that he developed knee pain to compensate for hip and back pain. Id. Ultimately, based on the physical examination, review of the medical evidence, and interview with the Veteran, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability was related to service based on the STRs showing a history of chronic right knee pain aggravated by running, marching, and lunging, and that the current diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome is a chronic right knee condition that occurs often in people who participate in strenuous activities to include running and jumping. See January 2024 VA Opinion. 

The Board finds the January 2024 VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her opinion a high probative weight considering the opinion correctly identified the Veteran's periods of active-duty service, reflected a review of the Veteran's record, and it was supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's medical treatment history.

In February 2024, the AOJ requested a new opinion for aggravation of a preexisting disability. The February 2024 VA examiner did not find a right knee diagnosis and offered a negative opinion based on the lack of diagnosis. See February 2024 VA Examination Report and VA Opinion. However, during the January 2024 examination, the Veteran reported right knee pain that causes difficulty with walking, standing, climbing for extended periods of time and difficulty with performing daily tasks, and was diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome. Id.  

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) found that the term "disability" used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and that the court held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability." Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Thus, where pain alone results in functional impairment, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, it can constitute a disability.

In this case, the Veteran is reporting right knee pain that results in functional impairment, and he has a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome. In light of the above, the February 2024 VA opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise, i.e., that the Veteran does not have a disability. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for a right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is granted. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbosacral strain, to include low back pain.

The Veteran claims that his low back pain was "caused by various training and operational exercises in which I had to carry 60+ pounds while marching or rucking on uneven terrain. [T]wisted spine combined with hip and knee pain caused lower back pain with degenerating disks." See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim, p. 14. Moreover, the Veteran also contends that "dislocation of my SI joint caused my spine to twist." Id., p. 13

A review of the Veteran's STRs reveals that he complained of low back pain intermittently since 2017, but that he also reported a history of low back pain since his right knee injury in 2016. See September 2023 STR, p. 51. In a separate occasion, in May 2018, the Veteran reported that the low back pain started in 2017, and that the low back pain radiates down to his right hip and right knee, with tightness and pinching pain, and only occasional spasms. Id., p. 57. In a separate May 2018 encounter, the Veteran also reported sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction. Id. Ultimately, in May 2018, the Veteran was put on profile for low back injury/pain. See September 2023 STR. 

Additionally, during a February 2019 private examination, the Veteran reported having low back pain for two years. See October 2023 Private Treatment Record. 

Finally, in January 2023, a private chiropractor opined that the Veteran had a moderate osteoarthritis and generative changes of the spine as well as chronic back pain in the lumbar region, and that the "nature of his job/military exacerbates his spinal condition." See September 2023 Private Treatment Record. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination and x-ray for his low back service connection claim, at which time he was diagnosed with lumbosacral strain. See January 2024 VA Examination Report and. The x-ray, however, was negative for degenerative changes or osteoarthritis. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. Moreover, with respect to his medical history, the Veteran reported that his low back disability started in 2016 due to compensation for hip and knee injuries, and that the disability manifested with back pain and tension, radiating down to the legs. Id. Ultimately, the VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion for the low back disability based on the Veteran's history of chronic lumbar strain, and reports of pain since his 2016 injury. See January 2024 VA Opinion. 

Here, the Board finds the January 2024 VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her opinion a high probative weight considering the opinion reflects a review of the Veteran's records, and it is supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's contentions and medical treatment history.

In February 2024, the AOJ obtained an addendum opinion for aggravation of a disability that preexisted the Veteran's second and third period of active-duty service. The February 2024 VA examiner opined the Veteran does not have a disability. See February 2024 VA Opinion. The Veteran, however, is reporting low back pain that results in functional impairment. Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Moreover, the January 2024 VA examiner found a diagnosis of lumbosacral strain. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the February 2024 VA opinion is inadequate, and of no probative value.  

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for a lumbosacral strain, to include low back pain. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for a lumbosacral strain, to include low back pain, is granted. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability.

The Veteran contends that his right hip disability is related to "various training and operational exercises in which I had to carry 60+ pounds while marching or rucking on uneven terrain." See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim.

In May 2018, the Veteran complained of right hip pain, as well as low back pain, and reported sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction. See September 2023 STRs. In a separate May 2018 encounter, the Veteran also reported SI joint dysfunction, and he was put on profile. Id. Finally, during the November 2022 separation examination, the Veteran complained of right hip pain. Id. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination and x-ray in connection with this claim for service connection for a right hip disability. At that time, the VA examiner found a diagnosis of trochanteric pain syndrome and sacroiliac (SI) dysfunction. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. The right hip x-ray was negative for any bone abnormalities. Id. With respect to his medical history, the Veteran reported that he developed pain in the right hip due to compensating for knee and back pain, and that his dislocation of the SI joint happened during active duty for training while he was running. Id. 

Notably, the Veteran was on active duty from June 2016 to January 2017, from January 2021 to February 2021, and from November 2021 to December 2022. See DD Form 214. Moreover, he was on active duty for training from October 1, 2017, to October 20, 2017, from March 19, 2018, to March 30, 2018, from April 7, 2018, to April 12, 2018, from April 27, 2018, to May 26, 2018, from June 22, 2018, to June 24, 2018, from July 13, 2018, to July 15, 201, and from August 24, 2018, to August 26, 2018. See December 2023 Military Personnel Record. 

In January 2024, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right hip disability is related to his service. See January 2024 VA Opinion. Specifically, the examiner reasoned that the Veteran had a history of right hip pain and sacroiliac disfunction, and that "Sacroiliac Joint dysfunction is a hip condition that causes lower back pain and/or leg pain. Often the mechanism is due to hypermobility or instability in the SI joint or hypomobility." See January 2024 VA Opinion. 

Here, the Board finds the January 2024 VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her opinion a high probative weight considering the opinion reflects a review of the Veteran's records, and it is supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's contentions and medical treatment history.

In February 2024, the AOJ requested an addendum opinion for aggravation of a disability that preexisted the Veteran's second and third period of active-duty service. The February 2024 examiner opined that because the right hip x-ray was negative, the Veteran did not have a disability. See February 2024 VA Opinion. The Veteran, however, is reporting right hip pain that results in functional impairment. Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Moreover, the January 2024 VA examiner found a diagnosis of trochanteric pain syndrome and sacroiliac (SI) dysfunction. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. As a result, the Board finds that the February 2024 VA opinion is inadequate, and of no probative value.  

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for a right hip disability. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability is granted. 

5. Entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression.

The Veteran contends that his depression and anxiety were caused by "long stents from home away from family, and stressful training and operational environments." See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. 

During the November 2022 separation examination, the Veteran reported trouble sleeping and concentrating on things, memory problems, and irritability. See September 2023 STR. The PTSD and depression screenings administered at that time were negative. Id. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination, at which time he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. Notably, the examiner indicated that anxiety and depression, along with low drive, reduced appetite, difficulty concentrating, and poor sleep, are symptoms of the same disability diagnosed as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression. Id. During the examination, the Veteran reported a history of childhood ADHD, with a more recent history of depression in 2021, after he was stationed in Arizona and his wife and newborn child were in Georgia. Id. Moreover, the Veteran indicated that in 2015 he experienced some anxiety while being in large crowds. Id. 

In January 2024, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression was related to service. See January 2024 VA Opinion. In support of the positive opinion, the VA examiner stated that the Veteran has been experiencing depression since 2021, which he attributed to being separated to his wife and son, and that he continues to experience recurring sadness, anxiety, low drive, reduced appetite, difficulty concentrating, and poor sleep. Id. 

Despite the VA examiner having explained that the anxiety is a symptoms of the Veteran's adjustment disorder, in February 2024, the AOJ requested a new opinion from a different examiner on the Veteran's complaints of anxiety. The February 2024 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of anxiety, which had already been established by the January 2024 VA examiner. See February 2024 VA Opinion. 

Here, the Board finds the January 2024 VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her opinion a high probative weight considering the opinion reflects a review of the Veteran's records, and it is supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's contentions and medical treatment history. In light of the above, the Board concludes that the Veteran's adjustment disorder started during a period of active-duty service, and it is related to service.

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression is granted.

6. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

The Veteran claims that his obstructive sleep apnea is related to service. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim.

A review of the Veteran's STRs shows that during the November 2022 separation examination, the Veteran reported trouble sleeping. See September 2023 STR. 

During a March 2023 private ENT examination, the Veteran reported snoring and subjective sleep apnea, and his spouse reported observing the Veteran having "sleep apnea episodes" at night for at least the past seven years. See December 2023 Private Treatment Record. In April 2023, the Veteran participated in a home sleep study, which revealed a diagnosis of mild obstructive sleep apnea. See December 2023 Private Treatment Record. 

Notably, the Veteran was on active duty from June 2016 to January 2017, from January 2021 to February 2021, and from November 2021 to December 2022. See DD Form 214. Moreover, he was on active duty for training from October 1, 2017, to October 20, 2017, from March 19, 2018, to March 30, 2018, from April 7, 2018, to April 12, 2018, from April 27, 2018, to May 26, 2018, from June 22, 2018, to June 24, 2018, from July 13, 2018, to July 15, 201, and from August 24, 2018, to August 26, 2018. See December 2023 Military Personnel Record. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his obstructive sleep apnea claim, at which time he reported that his symptoms started in 2017, with "constant changes in sleep patterns due to mobilization and assignments with added stress." See January 2024 Examination Report. Moreover, the Veteran reported apneas at night, as well as daytime fatigue and drowsiness. Id. Ultimately, the VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion on direct service connection based on the Veteran's spouse observations of episodes of sleep apnea that started in 2017, therefore during active-duty service. See January 2024 VA Opinion. 

Here, the Board finds the January 2024 VA examiner to be competent and credible and assigns her opinion high probative weight considering the opinion reflects a review of the Veteran's records, and it is supported by a reasoned medical explanation that is consistent with the Veteran's contentions and medical treatment history.

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the competent evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

The Veteran contends that his left knee disability, similarly to his right knee disability, is related to his service, specifically "carrying weighted rucks and walking in combat boots with little to no arch support." See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim. 

The Veteran's STRs does not reveal complaints of a left knee disability. See September 2023 STRs. 

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination and an x-ray, at which time he was diagnosed with a left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, but the x-ray was negative for any bone abnormalities. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. During the examination, the Veteran reported that he developed a left knee disability due to "compensating for hip and back pain." Id. 

The January 2024 VA examiner ultimately opined that the disability was related to service. See January 2024 VA Opinion. However, the rationale for the opinion only discusses evidence that pertain to the right knee pain, the opposite joint, and it does not provide any rationale in support of the evidence for the left knee. 

The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the case to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007) (holding "a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision as to what weight to assign to a doctor's opinion")."

In this case, the January 2024 VA examiner did not provide a rationale in support of the positive opinion for a left knee disability. Therefore, the Board finds the opinion inadequate to decide the claim.

In February 2024, the AOJ requested a new VA examination and opinion from a different examiner. At that time, the examiner did not provide a diagnosis, and offered a negative opinion based on the lack of a left knee diagnosis. See February 2024 VA Examination Report and VA Opinion. However, during the January 2024 examination, the Veteran reported left knee pain that causes difficulty with walking, standing, climbing for extended periods of time and difficulty with performing daily tasks, and was diagnosed with bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome. Id. Therefore, the Veteran is reporting left knee pain that causes functional impairment. Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Moreover, the January 2024 VA examiner found a diagnosis of left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome. See January 2024 VA Examination Report. In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the February 2024 VA opinion is inadequate, and of no probative value.  

The Board, therefore, concludes that the AOJ's reliance on the inadequate opinions constituted a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error that needs to be cured in order to adjudicate the claim on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion from an appropriate examiner on whether the Veteran's left knee disability is related to his active service. The need for an in-person examination of the Veteran is left to the discretion of the medical professional.

The VA examiner is required to provide opinions that answer the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left knee disability was incurred in, or is otherwise related to, his active service, to include "carrying weighted rucks and walking in combat boots with little to no arch support."

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left knee was caused or aggravated by the service-connected disabilities, to include low back disability and/or right hip disability. 

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability. 

The examiner is also advised that 38 U.S.C. § 1110 allows for service connection of conditions that would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability even if the worsening of the condition occurs due to the natural progression of that condition. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (2023).

The examiner must provide separate opinions and rationales to address secondary causation and secondary aggravation. Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018).

The reviewing clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history. Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. If the reviewing clinician rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide an explanation for such rejection. In forming the opinion, the examiner cannot rely on the absence of medical records corroborating disability.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed must be provided. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, discuss why this is the case. In this regard, indicate whether the inability to provide a definitive opinion is due to a need for further information or because the limits of medical knowledge have been exhausted regarding the etiology of the disability at issue or because of some other reason.

A rationale for all opinions expressed should be provided as the Board is precluded from making medical findings. A discussion of the facts and the medical principles involved will be of considerable assistance to the Board, including citation to any supporting medical treatises.
