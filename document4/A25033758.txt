REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected sarcoidosis, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from September 1987 to September 1991 and in the U.S. Army from March 1995 to August 1996.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Affairs (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected sarcoidoses, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he should be granted service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  See February 2023 VA21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  Specifically, he asserts that his OSA is secondary to his service-connected sarcoidosis.  

The Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

The AOJ obtained three etiology opinions in connection with the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection.  The January 2023 opinions concern whether the Veteran's OSA is related to his exposure to toxic exposure risk activities and whether the Veteran's OSA is an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness and thus are not relevant to the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection.  The April 2023 VA etiology opinion does not address whether the Veteran's OSA was aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected sarcoidoses and is therefore inadequate.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (holding that both causation and aggravation must be addressed in any VA medical opinion concerning secondary service connection).  On remand, the AOJ should obtain an etiology opinion that addresses both causation and aggravation.   

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's OSA.  An examination is not necessary unless the clinician deems otherwise.  A complete copy of the claims file, including a copy of this Remand, should be made available to the clinician for review.  

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a)	Is the Veteran's OSA at least as likely as not proximately due to his service-connected sarcoidosis?

(b)	Is the Veteran's OSA at least as likely as not aggravated, i.e., made worse, by the Veteran's service-connected sarcoidosis?

A complete, detailed rationale should be provided in support of all requested opinions.
