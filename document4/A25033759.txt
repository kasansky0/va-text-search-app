ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability other than service-connected allergic rhinitis (claimed as sinusitis) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The April 2024 rating decision on appeal denied service connection for tinnitus.

2. On May 23, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the denial of service connection for tinnitus in the April 2024 rating decision.

3. On May 24, 2024, the Veteran submitted a second VA Form 10182 appealing the denial of service connection for tinnitus in the April 2024 rating decision.

4. In June 2024, the first appeal was docketed.

5. The second appeal was improper because the first appeal as to the same issue remained open and pending and had not been withdrawn or adjudicated. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The present appeal violates the prohibition on?concurrent election?of appellate review lanes with respect to the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.?38 U.S.C. §?5104C; 38?C.F.R. § 3.2500.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met as based on prohibited concurrent election. 38 U.S.C. §§?5104C, 7105, 7108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.105; Terry v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?1 (2023), Hall v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?329 (2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from September 1995 to September 2000, to include service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the respiratory disability claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of such claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claim for sinusitis more broadly in order to clarify the nature of the benefit sought and ensure complete consideration of the claim. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. 

On or before the date that is one year after the date on which the AOJ issues a decision on an issue, an appellant may: (1) file a request for higher-level review, (2) file a supplemental claim, or (3) file a notice of disagreement. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). Once an appellant has taken one of these actions, the appellant may not take another such action for the same issue until the action taken has either been adjudicated or has been withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision by the appellant or an authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. Terry v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?1, 14 (2023) ("Ultimately, when the court reads subsection 5104C(a) as a whole, it sees that Congress provided that a claimant is able to select a second?administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option.").

Here, review of the claims file shows that the AOJ denied service connection for tinnitus in the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

On May 23, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the denial of service connection for tinnitus in the April 2024 rating decision and selecting the Direct Review docket. 

The Board issued a Docketing Letter in June 2024 for this appeal stream and assigned a Docket Number of D240523-443202. The record does not reflect that this appeal stream was withdrawn or that the matter was adjudicated. 

On May 24, 2024, the Veteran submitted the VA Form 10182 from which this appeal presently stems and included the issue of service connection to tinnitus as denied in the April 2024 rating decision. 

Evidently, the Veteran filed the present appeal while a prior appeal as to the same issue remained open and pending. As the prior appeal was not withdrawn or adjudicated, the filing of the present appeal constitutes a prohibited concurrent election, and the present appeal must be dismissed.

The Board acknowledges the notice provisions under 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) but does not find that they are for application here. The Board finds that it is not dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, but rather due to a non-jurisdictional claims processing error. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the Board may dismiss an appeal for a claims processing error, which is an error concerning the "claims processing rules" that govern the orderly processing of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times. See Hall v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?329 (2021); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 558 U.S. 67, 81 (2009). 

Here, it is unequivocal that multiple appeal streams for the same issue may not be pending before the Board simultaneously. Although the present appeal will be dismissed, the prior appeal remains open and pending before the Board. This appeal covers the entire appeal period stemming from the April 2024 rating decision. Accordingly, providing any additional notice would serve no useful purpose, and there is no indication that the additional delay to do so would actually avail the Veteran of any benefit. 

The Board emphasizes that the present dismissal does not impact the other appeal stream, which remains open and pending.

In sum, the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for a respiratory disability other than service-connected allergic to rhinitis (claimed as sinusitis) is remanded.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted in order to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

Following review of the service records associated with the claims file, it is not evident that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are complete. Additionally, a correspondence received by VA in July 2023 references a medical treatment provider that appears to be private. Accordingly, further development was warranted to obtain any outstanding records.

In February 2023, the AOJ obtained a VA examination, dated September 2023, which noted a diagnosis of only allergic rhinitis, and subsequently obtained a medical opinion in March 2024. The opinion was in favor of service connection for allergic rhinitis, which had already been awarded service connection in a February 2024 rating decision. The examiner did not substantively address the matter of sinusitis. Thus, this opinion is incomplete or not wholly adequate. The case must be returned for an addendum opinion. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA undertakes an examination, it must provide an adequate one).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding active duty service records from the appropriate records repositories. Any inability to obtain these records should be documented pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

2. Obtain any outstanding private/non-VA medical treatment records for the Veteran's claimed respiratory disability. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for such records. Any inability to obtain these records should be documented pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

3. Following completion of the above directives, obtain an addendum opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed respiratory disability from the VA examiner who performed the September 2023 examination or an appropriate medical professional if the examiner is unavailable. A new examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the examiner. After reviewing the claims folder in its entirety, the examiner should address the following: 

(a)	Identify any and all respiratory disabilities, by diagnosis, that the Veteran presently has or has had at any point since the claim was filed in March 2023. 

(b)	For any respiratory disability identified above, other than service-connected allergic rhinitis, is it approximately at least as likely as not etiologically related to the Veteran's active service, to include conceded environmental exposures in the Southwest Asia theater of operations?

In providing an opinion regarding the relationship of the claimed respiratory disability to the Veteran's toxic exposure, the examiner is asked to consider total potential exposure through all applicable deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is already service connected for allergic rhinitis and emphasizes that the examiner is asked to provide this opinion in order to address the Veteran's claim for service connection for sinusitis and to identify any and all respiratory disabilities present during the appeal period.
