REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 13, 2018 to September 12, 2022.

The rating decision on appeal was issued on April 24, 2024.  In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 24, 2022 issuance of the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the claim for service connection is received within one year of a veteran's discharge from service, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following discharge from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) for continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions of this part, including § 3.400, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue.

After a review of the record, the Board finds an effective date of September 13, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted. 

Procedurally, the Veteran submitted his original claim for service connection for tinnitus on October 7, 2022, which was within one year of his discharge from service.  His claim was denied in a January 27, 2023 rating decision.  On January 17, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting service connection for tinnitus.  In a January 22, 2024 letter, the Veteran was advised that because his claim for service connection for tinnitus had been previously denied, VA regulations required him to file his request on the proper form.  On January 23, 2024 the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the denial of service connection for tinnitus.  The April 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for tinnitus, effective January 23, 2024, noting the claim stemmed from an original disability claim that was received on January 17, 2024.  As such, the Board finds the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim for tinnitus since filing his initial claim.  As such, the date of claim is October 7, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  

Accordingly, because the date of claim is within one year of the Veteran's discharge from service, the proper effective date is the later of the day following discharge from service or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  The term "date entitlement arose" is not expressly defined. However, it has been interpreted as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefit sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  In the present case, the Veteran reported his tinnitus began during service.  See February 2024 VA audiological examination report.  As such, the Board finds that September 13, 2022, which is the day following the Veteran's discharge from service on September 12, 2022, is the proper effective date as it is the later of the day following discharge and the date entitlement arose.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Accordingly, an effective date of September 13, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.
