ORDER

Beginning February 24, 2024, entitlement to an increased rating of 100 percent for tonic-clonic seizures (seizure disability) is granted.

From February 29, 2024, entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the "s" rate is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Beginning February 24, 2024, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran averaged at least one major seizure per month over the last year.   

2. From February 29, 2024, the Veteran had a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and additional disability independently rated as 60 percent or more disabling.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for a 100 percent rating for a seizure disability are met beginning February 24, 2024.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8910.  

2. From February 29, 2024, the criteria for SMC at the "s" rate based on having one disability rated as 100 percent disabling and an additional disability or disabilities independently rated at least 60 percent disabling are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2004 to June 2008 and from October 2009 to January 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

By way of background, in April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, seeking an increased rating for his service-connected seizure disability (originally claimed as PTSD).  A June 2024 rating decision continued the 80 percent rating from the previous decision.  Subsequently, the Veteran submitted a June 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2024 rating decision.  In June 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which continued the previous decision after considering the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 decision.

The Veteran submitted an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the June 2024 rating decision.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran did not waive the remainder of his window to request a docket switch pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Because the current decision represents a full grant of the benefit sought, the lack of a waiver represents only harmless error by the Board.

Increased Rating 

Legal Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).  

Beginning February 24, 2024, entitlement to a rating of 100 percent for a seizure disability is granted.

The Veteran contends that his symptoms are productive of a higher rating for his service-connected seizure disability.  Specifically, he claims a 100 percent rating is warranted because he experiences major psychomotor seizures with an average frequency of at least one per month over the past year.  Under DC 8911, a 100 percent rating is warranted if there has been an average of at least one major seizure per month over the last year.  See June 2024 VA Form 20-0996.

As above, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting an increased rating on April 9, 2024.  Therefore, the appeal period for this claim is from April 9, 2024 (with a one year look back period).  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3).

Under the General Rating Formula for Major and Minor Epileptic Seizures the major seizures apply to DC 8910 for grand mal epilepsy and minor seizures apply to DC 8911 for to petit mal epilepsy.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The Veteran's seizure disability is specifically evaluated under DC 8910, grand mal epilepsy.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Major and Minor Epileptic Seizures, a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with a history of seizures warrants a 10 percent rating.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for at least one major seizure in the last two years; or at least two minor seizures in the last six months.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for at least one major seizure in the last six months or two in the last year; or averaging at least five to eight minor seizures weekly.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for averaging at least one major seizure in four months over the last year; or 9 to 10 minor seizures per week.  An 80 percent rating is warranted when averaging at least one major seizure in three months over the last year; or more than 10 minor seizures weekly.  The maximum 100 percent rating is warranted when averaging at least one major seizure per month over the last year.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

A major seizure is characterized by the generalized tonic-clonic convulsion with unconsciousness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8910, Note (1).  A minor seizure consists of a brief interruption in consciousness or conscious control associated with staring or rhythmic blinking of the eyes or nodding of the head ("pure" petit mal), or sudden jerking movements of the arms, trunk, or head (myoclonic type) or sudden loss of postural control (akinetic type).  Id. at Note (2).

Psychomotor seizures will be rated as major seizures under the general rating formula when characterized by automatic states and/or generalized convulsions with unconsciousness.  Psychomotor seizures will be rated as minor seizures under the general rating formula when characterized by brief transient episodes of random motor movements, hallucinations, perceptual illusions, abnormalities of thinking, memory or mood, or autonomic disturbances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8914.

Turning to the evidence of record, a September 2023 VA treatment record noted the Veteran's report that his last seizure occurred in September 2022.

A February 26, 2024, VA treatment record noted the Veteran's report of having three seizures in the past two days despite medication.

VA treatment records from April 2024 noted the Veteran's report that his last seizure before today was on March 29th and he typically has less than one seizure per month.  However, the Veteran also reported that ever since he moved to Gainesville from out of state in February, he has been having more frequent seizures (a few every week) but not multiple within a day.  He later explained that he is experiencing an increased seizure frequency in the last month.  He is experiencing several seizures which is different from his baseline of one seizure every 4 to 6 months.  He had missed a dose of Keppra with a breakthrough seizure in February 2024 but denied any missed doses before his most recent set of breakthrough seizures.   

The Veteran was afforded an April 2024 VA seizure disorder examination.  Upon examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of tonic-clonic seizures or grand mal epilepsy.  The examiner further noted generalized tonic-clonic convulsion and episodes of unconsciousness.  He concluded that the Veteran's average frequency of major psychomotor seizures is at least one per month over the past year.

After considering the totality of the record, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran averaged at least one major seizure per month over the last year.  Thus, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, a 100 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's seizure disability beginning February 24, 2024, which is the date the VA treatment records showed factually ascertainable worsening during the one year look back period.   38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3).    

As noted above, psychomotor seizures will be rated as major seizures under the general rating formula when characterized by automatic states and/or generalized convulsions with unconsciousness.  Here, the April 2024 examiner noted the Veteran's major psychomotor seizures are characterized by automatic states and/or generalized convulsions with unconsciousness.  In addition, the examiner determined that he experienced major psychomotor seizures at least once per month over the past year as required for a higher 100 percent rating under DC 8910. 

Accordingly, the Board has weighed the evidence of record and finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran averaged at least one major seizure per month over the last year.  The benefit-of-the-doubt rule is therefore for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

The Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that the evidence supports an increase to a 100 percent (maximum schedular) rating for the Veteran's seizure disability beginning February 24, 2024.  Again, this is the highest rating available under DC 8910 (and 8911).   

Entitlement to SMC at the "s" rate.

SMC benefits should be awarded when a veteran is eligible for them and without the need to file a separate claim.  Perciavalle v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 117, 122 (2019).  VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

A veteran may be entitled to SMC if, in addition to having a single permanent disability rated 100 percent disabling under the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, the Veteran has an additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate, and distinct from the permanent disability rated as 100 percent disabling and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  The total disability requirement must be met by a single disability and a TDIU based on a single disability will satisfy this requirement.  The 60 percent requirement may be met by applying the combined rating of the Veteran's remaining disabilities.  See Bradley at 280 (noting that combined ratings satisfy the second requirement but not the first).

Here, a 100 percent rating has been awarded based solely on the service-connected seizure disability effective February 24, 2024.  Also, beginning February 29, 2024, the Veteran had an additional disability rated at 60 percent or more separate from the service-connected seizure disability (posttraumatic stress disorder rated at 70 percent).  

Thus, entitlement to SMC at the "s" rate is granted effective February 29, 2024.
