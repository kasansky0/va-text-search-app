DOCKET NO. 210222-141491
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition (including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD (see March to April 2020 ERMC Counseling Services treatment records) and adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood (see January 2020 psychologist's report), thus establishing a current disability.

2. During service, the Veteran experienced depression and anxiety when she was removed from Air Force officer school; she was devastated, the events shattered her self-confidence and she was made to feel like it was her fault, like she was targeted, like she was under attack; during the year after that, she was so distressed that she could not focus enough to find employment; (see February 2025 Board hearing testimony), thus establishing an in-service injury.

3. Before service, the Veteran did not experience these observable symptoms but, after service, these observable symptoms persisted and worsened in frequency and severity until the present; thereby, establishing a causal link (nexus) between the currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder and the in-service objectively observable symptoms of that disorder.

4. The Board cannot assign significant probative weight to the August 2020 VA examination because the examiner provided no causal linkage opinion.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria are met for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 5, 1982 to May 27, 1982, September 1984 to January 1988, May 1996 to September 1996, and January 1999 to February 2000. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 27, 2025.

By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board cannot, by law, consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

After reviewing the evidence of record, and in light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for PTSD to encompass any acquired psychological disorder, including PTSD and adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood.

 For the reasons outlined in more detail above in the Findings of Fact section, the appeal for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition is granted.
