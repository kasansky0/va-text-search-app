ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a September 1972 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) denied service connection for internal derangement of the left knee on the basis that the left knee disability was not aggravated during service.  The Veteran was notified of that decision but did not appeal that decision.  No evidence was received within one year of the decision.

2. The October 2023 claim in which the Veteran raises a new theory of entitlement - secondary to the now-service-connected right knee disability - is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators but is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in the claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability. 

3. The evidence is in equipoise as to whether there were not any defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service as to the left knee.

4. The Veteran is entitled to the presumption of soundness as to the left knee disability.

5. Clear and unmistakable evidence establishes that the Veteran had a left knee disability prior to his period of active duty.

6. The record does not show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's preexisting left knee disability was not aggravated during his period of active duty. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The evidence received since the September 1972 rating decision is new and relevant, and readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1) (2025).

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304 (2025). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 1970 to August 1972 with additional service in Army National Guard.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2025).  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801 (2025). 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (2025).  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As noted above, the Board is finding that new and relevant evidence has been submitted to warrant the readjudication of the claim of service connection for a left knee disability.

Service connection

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability

Governing law and regulations

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Notwithstanding the above, service connection may be granted for disability shown after service, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred or aggravated in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, there must be (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).

A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

"Clear and unmistakable evidence" is a formidable evidentiary burden.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999). It is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable."  See Cotant v. West, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993).

VA's General Counsel has held that to rebut the presumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  The Veteran is not required to show that the disease or injury increased in severity during service before VA's duty under the second prong of this rebuttal standard attaches.  See VAOPGCPREC 3-2003; see also Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The burden of proof is on VA to rebut the presumption by producing clear and unmistakable evidence that a disability existed prior to service.  See Kinnaman v. Principi, 4 Vet. App. 20, 27 (1993).  The determination of whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that a defect, infirmity, or disorder existed prior to service should be based on "thorough analysis of the evidentiary showing and careful correlation of all material facts, with due regard to accepted medical principles pertaining to the history, manifestations, clinical course, and character of the particular injury or disease or residuals thereof."  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b)(1).

A preexisting disease or injury will be presumed to have been aggravated by service only if the evidence shows that the underlying disability underwent an increase in severity; the occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability.  See Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).

Analysis

In the March 2024 rating decision, the RO made the following favorable finding:  the Veteran has a current disability.  More specifically, the RO noted that the Veteran has left knee meniscal tear.  Thus, there is a favorable finding on current disability, Hickson element (1).

In the March 2024 rating decision, the RO also made the following favorable finding:  the meniscal tear preexisted service.  

At a February 1970 induction examination, the lower extremities were abnormal.  The clinician noted that the Veteran had had left knee surgery and that he was still weak.  It appears that in February 1970, the Veteran was assigned a temporary profile based on the lower extremities.  The induction report reflects that in August 1970 and November 1970 physical inspection showed no disqualifying defects.  The report also indicates that in November 1970 the left knee was cleared by a private medical doctor and that the profile for the lower extremities was changed to 1.  The Veteran entered service in November 1970.  The Board gives great weight to the August 1970 and November 1970 findings regarding no disqualifying defects and the normal profile in November 1970.  The evidence is in equipoise as to whether there were not any defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service as to the left knee.  The Veteran is entitled to the presumption of soundness as to the left knee disability.

In a February 2024 VA medical opinion, a VA doctor determined that the left knee disability clearly and unmistakably preexisted service.  The physician noted that the Veteran had a history of a traumatized left knee meniscus due to a football injury in 1969 that led to a meniscectomy before enlistment.  The clinician indicated that the pre-service injury and subsequent surgery established a baseline of compromised knee integrity.  Based on the February 2024 VA medical opinion showing that there was compromised knee integrity prior to service, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the left knee disability existed prior to service on entrance.

The crux of this case thus revolves around whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's left knee disability was not aggravated during service.  In the February 2024 VA medical opinion, the VA doctor opined that the Veteran's complaints of left knee pain during service were clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression during service by an in-service injury, event, or illness.  The physician noted that the Veteran experienced a twisting injury involving the left knee in December 1970 during basic training and that he complained of bilateral knee pain in April 1972.  The clinician stated that meniscectomy, particularly in the era before the Veteran's service, often led to long-term joint issues due to the removal of the joint cartilage.  The doctor indicated that the natural progression of a knee post-meniscectomy can include pain, instability, and degenerative changes.  The physician noted that while the Veteran sustained a left knee injury in service, there is no documented evidence of surgical intervention that would have significantly altered the trajectory of the preexisting left knee disability.  The clinician added that given the lack of surgical intervention or documented significant new structural damage during service, it is challenging to attribute the worsening of the Veteran's left knee disability solely to service events.  The doctor stated that based on the available medical records and typical course of post-meniscectomy knee disabilities, it is not clearly and unmistakably evident that the left knee disability was aggravated beyond its natural progression by his military service.  The physician noted that the preexisting knee disability, characterized by pain and structural compromise, was likely to progress negatively over time and that the in-service incidents did not definitively alter this expected trajectory.

The Board notes that the VA doctor stated not only that it was clear and unmistakable that left knee disability was not aggravated by service but also that it is not clearly and unmistakably evident that the left knee disability was aggravated beyond its natural progression by his military service.  Given that the VA doctor provided opinions with two different standards on aggravation and given the evidence of in-service treatment for left knee pain in December 1970 and in-service complaint of left knee pain in April 1972, the Board reaches the conclusion that the record, viewed as a whole, does not show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's preexisting left knee disability was not aggravated during service.  Thus, Hickson elements (2) and (3), in-service aggravation and medical nexus between the current left knee disability and the in-service aggravation, are satisfied.  The benefit sought on appeal is accordingly allowed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304

As the Board is granted service connection for the left knee disability based on in-service aggravation, the Board does not have to address whether the left knee disability was caused or aggravated by the now-service-connected right knee strain.
