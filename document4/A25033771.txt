ORDER

The appeal is missed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In June 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher-Level Review listing entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids.

2. In June 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement listing entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. As concurrent elections for review are prohibited, the criteria for the dismissal of the appeals for entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2), 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), 20.205.

2. As concurrent elections for review are prohibited, the criteria for the dismissal of the appeals for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2), 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran has active service from June 2000 to October 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 0 percent for erectile dysfunction.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids.

A February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for a penile condition, subsequently clarified as erectile dysfunction, with an initial noncompensable rating. That same decision denied service connection for hemorrhoids. 

In June 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher-Level Review listing entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids. 

In June 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement listing entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids.

In a July 2024 letter, the Board notified the Veteran that it would not review his appeals for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids due to the pending Higher-Level Review for the same issues. 

The AOJ issued a Higher-Level Review rating decision September 2024 addressing service connection for hemorrhoids and the rating for erectile dysfunction.

VA regulation provides that claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing a HLR request, a Board Appeal, or a Supplemental Claim. 38 C.F.R. §?3.2500(a). VA regulation prohibits concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different appeal lanes and indicates that "a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option." 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). A claimant may withdraw a Supplemental Claim or HLR request at any time before VA issues a decision on the issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d). If a claimant wishes to change the review option while an issue is pending adjudication, and it is within one year of the prior decision notice, the claimant may do so by withdrawing the request as prescribed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d) and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e); see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 3 (2023) (holding, in pertinent part, that "a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within 1 year of an initial AOJ decision on a claim, provided that such administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request").

Here, the Board finds the issues must be dismissed as they were improperly docketed. As the Veteran did not withdraw his June 2024 Request for Higher-Level Review prior to the issuance of the September 2024 Higher-Level review rating decision, his June 2024 Board Appeal is an improper concurrent election. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Thus, the instant appeals as to the issues of entitlement to entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction and entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids were erroneously docketed and must be dismissed.
