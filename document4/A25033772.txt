ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date for service connection for insomnia of March 30, 2022, but no earlier, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date for service connection for depressive disorder of July 15, 2022, but no earlier, is granted. 

Entitlement to a rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for depressive disorder with insomnia on and after January 5, 2023, is granted.

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's January 26, 2022, application for compensation for "memory loss" is a claim for any acquired psychiatric disability.

2. After a November 2022 rating decision denied the January 26, 2022, claim, the Veteran filed the January 5, 2023, application for compensation for "depression" and "mental disorders" granted in the March 2023 rating decision underlying this appeal.

3. The January 5, 2023, application for compensation was on a form prescribed by the Secretary and sought the same benefit as the January 26, 2022, claim.

4. The Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia on March 30, 2022, but no earlier, and the condition is due to his service-connected tinnitus.

5. The Veteran was diagnosed with depressive disorder on July 15, 2022, but no earlier, and the condition is due to his service-connected tinnitus.

6. On and after January 5, 2023, the Veteran's depressive disorder and insomnia have manifested in symptoms such as difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, memory issues, impaired impulse control such as unprovoked irritability with periods of verbal violence, sleep disturbances leading to difficulty with concentration and mood, mood swings, and social isolation from family and friends, which together reflect a disability picture more nearly approximating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

7. On and after January 5, 2023, the Veteran's depressive disorder and insomnia have not manifested in a disability picture more nearly approximating total occupational and social impairment.

8. The Veteran's service-connected disabilities have not rendered him unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of March 30, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for insomnia are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(36), 1131, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.400, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for an effective date of July 15, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for depressive disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(36), 1131, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.400, 3.2501.

3. The criteria for an initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for depressive disorder and insomnia are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.

4. The criteria for a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1985 to March 1990. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 14, 2023, rating decision (and, for the increased-rating claim, a March 20, 2023, higher-level review (HLR) of the March 14, 2023, rating decision) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

On March 5, 2024, VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement electing the Board's Direct Review docket. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the respective decisions under review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

Applicable Evidentiary Window

Given the Veteran's election of the Direct Review docket, in this decision the Board has only considered the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of the decision on review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Restyled Claim

The March 14, 2023, rating decision granted service connection for what it styled as a single claim, "depressive disorder with major depressive like episode and insomnia," and the Veteran now appeals for an earlier effective date for this relief. As more fully discussed below, depressive disorder and insomnia are separate disabilities, and therefore the appropriate effective date for each grant must be addressed separately. The claim has been split to reflect this.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I. Earlier Effective Dates

The Veteran disagrees with the March 14, 2023, rating decision's assigned effective date for service connection for "depressive disorder due to another medical condition with major depressive like episode and insomnia (claimed as Insomnia, depression, mental disorders." The AOJ assigned an effective date of January 5, 2023, the date VA received an Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), but the Veteran through his attorney asserts that the effective date should be from either January 2022 or February 2022, when the Veteran submitted an Application for Disability Compensation claim for "memory loss" (on January 26, 2022) and then "PTSD personal trauma" (on February 23, 2022).

The overarching effective-date rule is that an award based on a claim for compensation should be date the claim was received or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; see 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). 

The Board therefore will address the claim in two parts, one for the date of claim and the other for the date entitlement arose. The first part will review the procedural history and address why the January 5, 2023, Form 21-526EZ underlying this appeal may be construed as a supplemental claim that maintained continuous pursuit from the January 26, 2022, claim. In the second part, the Board will address the date entitlement to service connection arose for depressive disorder and for insomnia, resulting in separate earlier effective dates for each disability.

A. Date of Claim

1. Procedural History 

In early 2022, the Veteran submitted four service-connection claims in quick succession: "memory loss" (January 26, 2022), "PTSD personal trauma" (February 23, 2022), "sleep disturbances" (March 3, 2022), and "anxiety" (March 5, 2022). See January 26, 2022, February 23, 2022, March 3, 2022, and March 5, 2022 VA Forms 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation). In November 2022, the AOJ decided all of these claims as a single unit, denying "service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (also claimed as anxiety, memory loss, sleep disturbances)." See November 9, 2022, Rating Decision.

Shortly after that denial, the Veteran filed another Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ), this time for "mental disorder" and "psychophysiological disorder." See November 23, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ. The AOJ took this as a request for review of the previously denied claim for PTSD, anxiety, memory loss, and sleep disturbances, and mailed the Veteran a letter that he had to file on a different, proper form. See November 30, 2022, Letter. 

On January 5, 2023, VA received two forms. One was a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review) that sought higher-level review (HLR) of the November 2022 rating decision's denial of service connection for PTSD, anxiety, memory loss, and sleep disturbance. The other was a new Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for conditions including "depression" and "mental disorders." See January 5, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ.

The dual submissions resulted in a January 11, 2023, HLR rating decision that denied service connection, which is not on appeal in this matter; and the March 14, 2023, rating decision that granted service connection for depressive disorder and insomnia, which is on appeal. See January 11, 2023, Rating Decision, and March 10, 2023, Rating Decision. The March 2023 rating decision assigned an effective date of January 5, 2023, the day on which VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ for compensation for "depression" and "mental disorders."

2. Discussion

The starting point for the date of the claim is January 5, 2023, the day on which VA received the Form 21-526EZ that led to the award of compensation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1). But the date of claim may be considered the date an initial claim was filed, if the claim is "continuously pursued." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2). Continuous pursuit is maintained where a claimant files a supplemental claim, a request for HLR, or a request for Board review within one year of the date on which the AOJ issued a decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2)(B). For as far back as a claim is continuously pursued, the date of claim can be daisy-chained back to that date. 

In this case, the Veteran filed multiple initial claims before January 5, 2023, that were denied by the November 2022 rating decision. One of those claims could be considered the date of claim for the grant of service connection for depressive disorder, but only if the Veteran continuously pursued the claim after the November 2022 rating decision. The two filings on January 5, 2023-a VA Form 21-526EZ and a VA Form 21-0996-are what could have established continuous pursuit in this case. Here, the Board need not address the effect on continuous pursuit of the January 5, 2023, request for HLR, because the Board finds that continuous pursuit is established by the January 5, 2023, Form 21-526EZ, which may be construed as a supplemental claim. 

Until recently, VA has accepted as a supplemental claim only those filed on a VA Form 20-0995, the prescribed form for a "Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim." See VA Form 20-0995. Indeed, when the Veteran submitted his November 23, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ that the AOJ construed as seeking review of the November 2022 rating decision, the claim was rejected and the Veteran was told that he needed to file on an appropriate form (one of which was the VA Form 20-0995). See November 30, 2022, Letter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), however, has newly explained that because VA's regulation regarding supplemental claims requires merely a filing on "a prescribed form," see 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501, a claim on any prescribed form may be a supplemental claim so long as it meets the other elements of a supplemental claim. Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, at *8-11 (Vet. App. March 14, 2025). Here, the Veteran's January 5, 2023, claim was filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ, which is "a prescribed form," so the remaining question is whether it meets the definition of a supplemental claim.

The Board finds that it does. A supplemental claim is defined as a "claim for benefits ... filed by a claimant who had previously filed a claim for the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis." 38 U.S.C. § 101(36) (defining "supplemental claim"); id. The Veteran's January 5, 2023, sought service-connected compensation, just like the earlier, January 26, 2022, claim did. Moreover, the two claims sought compensation on the same basis: they both applied for compensation for an acquired psychiatric disorder. Nominally, the January 26, 2022, claim was for "memory loss" while the January 5, 2023, claim was for "depression" and "mental disorders." But the Veteran filed pro se and is not a medical expert, so he is not expected to be able to describe his medical condition with precision; instead, a simple description of the symptoms ("memory loss" and "depression") or a general description of the condition ("mental disorders") was sufficient to identify the claim. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009); see also Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2020). So, both claims were construable as claims for an acquired psychiatric disorder. In turn, because the January 5, 2023, Form 21-526EZ was a claim for the same benefit on the same or similar basis as the January 26, 2022, claim (and, as mentioned earlier, was filed on "a prescribed form"), it meets the criteria to be considered a supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 101(36); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; Chisholm, No. 22-7028, at *8-11 (Vet. App. March 14, 2025); see Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 290-91 (2024) (holding that a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting an increased rating for a new period of time was not a supplemental claim for review of an earlier-denied claim that originated in a claim for service connection). 

The Board acknowledges that construing the January 5, 2023, Form 21-526EZ as a supplemental claim results in an apparent concurrent election, given that the Veteran submitted a Form 21-0996 (request for HLR) on the same day. But the rule against concurrent election is a mere claims-processing ruling and, as such, is waivable, so VA's processing of both the supplemental claim (by issuing the March 14, 2022, rating decision on appeal) and the request for HLR (by issuing the March 20, 2023, higher-level review decision) may be viewed as VA having waived enforcement of the rule against concurrent election. See generally Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 267 (2024) (en banc) (setting out the framework for applying claims-processing rules). To the extent construing the January 5, 2023, claim as a supplemental claim would have required new and relevant evidence that, assuming arguendo, may not have been secured, the same reasoning applies: VA's ultimate processing of the claim in a rating decision granting service connection may be viewed as having waived enforcement of the mere claims-processing rule requiring new and relevant evidence. Id.; see 38 U.S.C. § 5108(a).  

The Board therefore finds continuous pursuit of the January 26, 2022, claim. Within one year of the November 2022 rating decision denying that claim, the Veteran submitted the January 5, 2023, supplemental claim, which resulted in the March 14, 2023, rating decision that granted service connection and which was appealed in the March 5, 2024, notice of disagreement underlying this matter. Accordingly, for purposes of considering entitlement to an earlier effective date, the date of claim is January 26, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).

B. Date Entitlement Arose

Having determined the date of the claim, the Board now determines the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; see 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). 

1. Law

The phrase "date entitlement arose," which is not defined in the statute or regulation, has been interpreted to mean the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. See Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). 

For service connection, compensation is warranted for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing entitlement to service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service event, injury, or disease and the present injury or disease. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Regarding the first element, for mental health disabilities, the evidence must establish a diagnosis conforming to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).

2. Discussion

After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for insomnia arose on March 30, 2022, but no earlier, and entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder arose on July 15, 2022, but no earlier. As mentioned in the Introduction, the AOJ adjudicated both the disorders as one and granted service connection for what it styled as a single claim. The evidence makes clear, however, that depressive disorder and insomnia are two different psychiatric disorders, and therefore the Board addresses them separately, finding a different earlier effective date warranted for each. 

a. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia arose on March 30, 2022, but no earlier. 

For insomnia, the Board finds that an effective date is warranted from March 30, 2022, the first date on which the Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia. 

In early 2022, the Veteran reported that he began experiencing worsened mental health symptoms after his nephew lost his life in military service in late 2021. See March 23, 2022, VA Psychology Note. The Veteran filed his VA claims and told his VA primary care provider that he wanted to see a mental health provider for symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia, lack of motivation, and fatigue. See March 14, 2022, VA Primary Care Note. On March 30, 2022, the Veteran saw D.R., a VA clinical psychologist holding a Psy. D. degree. D.R. reviewed the Veteran's history and symptoms and rendered a diagnostic impression of insomnia. See March 30, 2022, VA Psychology Note. 

The Board finds that March 30, 2022, is the earliest date on which there is sufficient evidence of a diagnosis of insomnia rendered in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125. Though prior VA treatment records noted, for example, that the Veteran was being "[n]ewly treated with Depression, PTSD & Insomnia" or that the Veteran "admit[s] to anxiety[,] depression[,] insomnia[, and] PTSD," the Board finds these notes mere comments about the Veteran's symptoms, not diagnoses of insomnia that could be construed as in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125. See March 16, 2020, VA Care Coordination Telehealth Note & March 14, 2022, VA Primary Care Note. None of the earlier notes purported to be formal diagnostic assessment, and none were prepared by an author with any apparent specialized psychiatric education, training, or experience that would render them competent to diagnose psychiatric disorders. (For example, the March 16, 2022, note was by a Registered Nurse, while the March 14, 2022, note was by a physician holding a D.O. degree.) Though "a clear (that is, unequivocal) [mental health] diagnosis by a mental-health professional must be presumed (unless evidence shows to the contrary) to have been made in accordance with the applicable DSM criteria," Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997), the evidence is neither an unequivocal diagnosis nor made by a mental health professional, and therefore it is not presumed to have been made in accordance with the DSM. Id. The earliest record that can be viewed as a diagnosis of insomnia in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 is Dr. D.R.'s psychology note on March 30, 2022. 

The Board further finds that the insomnia diagnosed on March 30, 2022, was related to the Veteran's service-connected disability. The AOJ ultimately granted service connection for insomnia because a clinician linked it to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus and migraine headaches due to tinnitus. See February 8, 2023, VA Opinion ("The [insomnia and depressive disorder] are associated with veteran's ... service-connected conditions of migraines/headaches and [t]innitus."); see March 10, 2023, Rating Decision (granting service connection on a secondary basis). Because tinnitus was a service-connected disability as of March 30, 2022, the February 2023 opinion is sufficient to establish that the Veteran's insomnia as diagnosed on March 30, 2022, was related to his service-connected tinnitus. 

All of the criteria for service connection for insomnia therefore were met on March 30, 2022, so entitlement to service connection for insomnia arose on that date. Because the evidence does not establish a diagnosis of insomnia in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 prior to March 30, 2022, entitlement to service connection for insomnia did not arise any earlier. 

As discussed above, the date of claim is the continuously pursued January 26, 2022, claim. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia arose on March 30, 2022. Therefore, March 30, 2022, which is the later of the two dates, is the earliest effective date that can be assigned. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

b. Entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder arose on July 15, 2022, but no earlier.

For depressive disorder, an effective date is warranted from July 15, 2022, the first date on which the Veteran was diagnosed with depressive disorder. 

At the Veteran's first VA mental health treatment session, D.R. (the clinical psychologist with a Psy. D. degree) evaluated the Veteran and rendered a diagnostic impression of "mixed anxiety disorder (R/O [(rule out)] PTSD))." See March 23, 2022, VA Psychology Note. A couple weeks later, the Veteran saw M.S., a VA psychiatrist holding an M.D. degree, who rendered a diagnostic impression of "Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood" and "r/o PTSD." See April 23, 2022, VA Psychiatric Consult. The Veteran continued seeing D.R. and M.D., and both continued to offer the same diagnostic impressions See May 4, 2022, VA Psychology Note (D.R. assessing "mixed anxiety disorder"); June 4, 2022, VA Note (M.D. assessing "Adjustment Disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood" and "r/o PTSD").

During this time, other VA medical notes included "Depression - Major Depressive Disorder" among the Veteran's diagnosed conditions. See, e.g., June 21, 2022, and July 7, 2022, Notes. However, these notes were medication-risk reviews ("Data-Based Opioid Risk Review") and did not purport to be formal diagnostic assessments. What's more, the notes were prepared by an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (June 21, 2022) and a pain management pharmacist (July 7, 2022), not an author with any apparent specialized psychiatric education, training, or experience that would render them competent to diagnose psychiatric disorders. These purported diagnoses were not unequivocal diagnostic assessments made by mental-health professionals, and therefore the Board does not presume or find that they were rendered in accordance with the DSM. See Cohen, 10 Vet. App. at 140; 38 C.F.R. § 4.125.

Instead, the earliest date on which such a diagnosis of depressive disorder was rendered was July 15, 2022. On that day, the Veteran saw Dr. M.D. for another treatment session, and after she evaluated the Veteran's condition on that day, she rendered an additional assessment of "Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition with major depressive-like episode." See July 15, 2022, VA Psychiatric Outpatient Note. This was the same condition diagnosed at the February 2023 VA examination and that the VA examiner opined was related to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus and migraine headaches due to tinnitus. See February 8, 2023, VA Opinion ("The [depressive disorder and insomnia] are associated with veteran's ... service-connected conditions of migraines/headaches and [t]innitus."); see March 10, 2023, Rating Decision (granting service connection on a secondary basis). Because tinnitus was a service-connected disability as of July 15, 2022, the February 2023 opinion is sufficient to establish that the Veteran's depressive disorder as diagnosed on July 15, 2022, was related to his service-connected tinnitus.

Accordingly, all the criteria for service connection for depressive disorder were met as of July 15, 2022, so entitlement to service connection arose on that date. Because the evidence does not establish a diagnosis of depressive disorder in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 prior to July 15, 2022, entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder did not arise any earlier than that.

Between the date that entitlement arose and the continuously pursued January 26, 2022, claim, the latter is July 15, 2022. So, July 15, 2022, is the earliest effective date that can be assigned. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

C. Conclusion 

The March 2023 rating decision on review granted service connection for depressive disorder and for insomnia, and the Veteran's appeal sought an earlier effective date for these grants of service connection. The effective date of service connection must be the later of the date of the claim and the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Here, the date of claim is January 26, 2022, the day on which VA received the Veteran's continuously pursued claim for what may be construed as a claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder. But entitlement to service connection for the two disorders arose later than January 26, 2022: the evidence does not establish a diagnosis of insomnia until March 30, 2022, and until July 15, 2022, for depressive disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Therefore, the effective date for the grants of service connection for insomnia and depressive disorder must be those later dates when entitlement to service connection arose for each respective disability.

The Board must mention here that the Veteran through his attorney expressly "waives his right to further development under VA's duty to assist ... and asks the Board to promulgate a decision on the evidence of record." See March 5, 2024, Attorney Argument at 2. As specifically cited by the Veteran's attorney, the Court has held that a claimant can waive this right so long as it is done intentionally, voluntarily, and freely. See Janssen v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2001); see March 5, 2024, Attorney Argument at 2 (citing Janssen). The attorney's submission makes clear that the Veteran's waiver is intentional, voluntary, and freely made, and so the Board will accept the waiver of the duty to assist. Consequently, the Board has reached this decision based only on the evidence already of record, without regard for any duty-to-assist errors that would have justified a remand for further development to help the Veteran substantiate his claims. 

Entitlement to an effective date for service connection for insomnia of March 30, 2022, but no earlier, is granted; and entitlement to an effective date for service connection for depressive disorder of July 15, 2022, but no earlier, is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(36), 1131, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.400, 3.2501.

II. Increased Rating

The Veteran disagrees with the March 20, 2023, higher-level review of the March 14, 2023, rating decision's assignment of an initial rating of 50 percent for his service-connected depressive disorder due to another medical condition with major depressive like episode and insomnia. After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board finds that on and after January 5, 2023, an increased rating of 70 percent, but no higher, may be awarded.

A. Introductory Matters

While this appeal was pending, an August 2024 rating decision granted an increased rating of 70 percent from January 19, 2024. See August 15, 2024, Rating Decision. The Board notes that although its review in this case can consider entitlement to a higher rating even beyond the date that the March 20, 2023, higher-level review on appeal was issued, the new August 2024 rating decision is not on appeal and the evidence it considered may not be reviewed (other than any evidence that was also considered in the March 20, 2023, higher-level review that is on appeal).

The Board also clarifies the period on review, in light of its above grants of earlier effective dates. The AOJ set the effective date of service connection to January 5, 2023, and so it assigned an initial rating for the period on and after that date. Because it is this decision of the AOJ that is currently on appeal, the Board's review is limited to the period on and after January 5, 2023. Above, the Board has granted effective dates prior to January 5, 2023; however, the initial ratings for the newly granted periods will be decided by the AOJ in the first instance downstream. If the Veteran disagrees with the ratings assigned in those future decisions, he can seek further review at that time.

B. Legal Criteria

Disability ratings are determined by assessing the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (also referred to as the Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. Where a veteran challenges the initial rating of a disability for which the veteran has been granted service connection, the Board considers all evidence of severity since the effective date for the award of service connection. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125 (1999). 

The Veteran's psychiatric disorders are rated jointly under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9343, for major depressive disorder, which is in turn rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. Under the General Rating Formula, a 50-percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70-percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such an unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100-percent rating, the highest schedular rating, is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

In determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is a veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442. Nevertheless, all ratings in the General Rating Formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology, and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that a veteran's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms. A veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118. In deciding the case, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

C. Evidence

Though the period on review begins January 5, 2023, evidence prior to that date may still be probative of the overall disability picture. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board therefore will review the evidence prior to the period on review in addition to the evidence during the period. 

In early 2022, the Veteran submitted his claims in which he reported experiencing symptoms of "memory loss," "sleep disturbances," and anxiety. See January 26, 2022, March 3, 2022, and March 5, 2022, VA Forms 21-526EZ. 

In a March 2022 letter, the Veteran's partner, who is also his caretaker, related that the Veteran had nightmares, "memory issues" that required her to manage his medication and that caused him to repeat questions just "10 to 15 minutes" after she answered them, mood swings that "come out of nowhere" and go from "laughing [to] shut down and won't talk or he will yell," anxiety, paranoia in crowds, and a heightened startle response to noises like fireworks. See March 7, 2022, D.E. Letter. The Veteran's sisters also submitted letters detailing the Veteran's "anger issues," "lack of trust," and distancing himself from family and friends. See March 15, 2022, P.A. and M.R. Letters.

In March 2022, the Veteran also began seeking mental health treatment at VA. On March 14, 2022, he told his primary care provider that he had anxiety, depression, insomnia, lack of motivation, and fatigue. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideations. On March 16, 2022, VA psychology contacted him by phone, and he "[a]ctively denied SI/HI [suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation]." See March 14, 2022, VA Primacy Care Note; March 16, 2022, VA Psychology Note.

At his first VA psychology treatment session on March 23, 2022, he was found to have "significant difficulty with anxiety," a heightened startle reflex, disrupted sleep and insomnia, and a depressed mood. He "avoid[ed] most people" and avoided recreation. At work, he was previously a top performer but was now "struggling to maintain his job." On the day of the treatment session, he was tearful and "very anxious initially." He denied any suicidal or homicidal ideations. See March 23, 2022, VA Psychology Note. The next day, VA received a phone call that the Veteran's "[f]amily is very concerned about his mental health including anxiety, depression, and irritability"; there had been "considerable change over the past few weeks." See March 24, 2022, VA Psychology Note. 

At a March 30, 2022, psychology session, the Veteran reported a "slight decrease" of overall anxiety and agitation, but the levels "remain[ed] challenging." He was taking a "break from work" to focus on his health. On the day of the treatment session, he was found to be anxious with "mild psychomotor agitation." See March 30, 2022, VA Psychology Note.

At psychiatric treatment sessions in April 2022, the Veteran reported that in the recent months he had experienced a persistent negative emotional state, avoidance, markedly diminished interest and participation in activities, feeling detached from others, irritable behavior and angry outbursts with little to no provocation "that led to losing jobs," hypervigilance, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbances. He and his partner described "many situations where the symptoms disrupted family life and ability to participate in social situations." He was found not to have any manic or psychotic symptoms, and he did not have suicidal ideation. See April 23, 2022, VA Psychology Consult. He continued to have sleep disturbances, "wak[ing] up with panic attacks and nightmares" and "occasionally ... walk[ing] and pacing most of the night." See April 28, 2022, VA Sleep Clinic Consult. 

In a May 2022 application for compensation, the Veteran alleged that he was unemployable due in part to "not being able to sleep th[rough] the night." See May 17, 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ. A VA treatment note that month recorded his report that he was "filing for short term disability, due to [his] mental and physical health." See May 19, 2022, VA Medical Note. At a mental health treatment session, he was found to "remain[] highly stressed with depression and anxiety." Medication seemed to help with sleep but not with anxiety or depression. The Veteran reported "that he does best staying away from others." See May 4, 2022, VA Psychology Note.

In June 2022, the Veteran answered "Yes" to whether over the prior month he had ever wished he were dead or wished that he could go to sleep and not wake up. See June 21, 2022, VA Suicide Screen. A report-of-symptoms on the same day found him with "not much" energy but otherwise with normal speech, mood "calm and relaxed," linear and appropriate thought processes, negative for current depression and anxiety, and denying suicidal or homicidal ideation. See June 21, 2022, VA Pain Management Consult.

A June 2022 VA medical note recorded the Veteran's "Working status" as "Working less frequently due to the pain," with a remark of "Occupation: Sports Official - Baseball." See June 21, 2022, VA Note. 

In July 2022, the Veteran reported that medications were helping. He continued to experience poor sleep that he attributed to "not having [a] CPAP machine yet." The day after a poor night's sleep, he was fatigued and had difficulty concentrating and remembering details. No manic or psychotic symptoms were present, and he had no current suicidal ideation. See July 6, 2022, and July 15, 2022, VA Treatment Notes. A mental status examination on July 15, 2022, found the Veteran alert and polite, with normal speech, normal thinking, without hallucinations, in a neutral mood with sad affect, and denying suicidal ideation. He was noted to have been referred to a psychotherapist through VA's Community Care program "but the patient failed to make an appointment." A follow-up with the VA mental health provider was offered, though it was noted that the Veteran "preferred to communicate [about] medications via secure message and to determine follow up" later. See July 15, 2022, VA Psychiatry Outpatient Note. 

A July 2022 medical note by Dr. R.A.D., a private neurologist, related the Veteran's report of memory problems, "word finding problems," anxiety, and trouble with employment. See July 11, 2022, Dr. R.A.D. Note.

From July 2022 through August 2022, there are no treatment notes of one-on-one psychotherapy, though the Veteran did attend VA Whole Health Psychology Groups. At all of the sessions, he did not report suicidal ideation, intent, or plan. See July 18, 2022, August 3, 2022, August 9, 2022, August 10, 2022, August 16, 2022, August 17, 2022, August 23, 2022, and August 24, 2022, VA Whole Health Psychology Group Notes. 

An August 16, 2022, VA Care Coordination Report recorded the Veteran as being alert and oriented, with a normal mood, affect, judgment, and speech. He denied depression and denied suicidal ideation. See August 16, 2022, VA Care Coordination Report.

Also in August 2022, the Veteran submitted an Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940) in which he asserted that he became too disabled to work in March 2022 due in part to disabilities of "cognitive," "PTSD," and "Insomnia." See August 1, 2022, VA Form 21-8940. 

Messages between the Veteran and his VA primary care provider in September 2022 show that he had been able to attend his daughter's wedding. The "stress [was] crazy," but he "made it through [the] wedding ok," though he "did have to leave early because of the anxiety and stress." See September 8, 2022, and September 11, 2022, VA Primary Care Notes.

On October 13, 2022, the Veteran emailed his VA provider with the following request: "The company I work for is asking for a letter letting them know that I'm ok to work. I.E. made all my appointment to the VA exams. I think it's just something that telling them I have been making all my appointment and cleared to work." See October 13, 2022, Email. 

On VA questionnaires in December 2022 and January 2023, the Veteran answered "No" to whether over the prior month he had wished he were dead or wished he could go to sleep or not wake up. He also answered "No" to whether over the prior month he had any actual thoughts of killing himself. See December 3, 2022, VA Emergency Department Note; January 31, 2022, VA Addendum Note. 

In a February 2023 statement, the Veteran described a history of anger problems with "outburst[s]." He listed episodes of divorce and a restraining order issued during that process, "a few" fights, a felony charge, and taking anger management classes. See February 12, 2023, Veteran Statement.

A VA examination was provided on February 8, 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's depressive disorder and insomnia manifested in symptoms that were not differentiable. The Veteran's symptoms at that time included difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances including work or a worklike setting, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, disturbances of motivation and mood, chronic sleep impairment, anxiety, and a depressed mood. The examiner remarked that the Veteran "[e]ndorsed passive suicidal ideation, no plans or attempts." See February 8, 2023, VA Examination.

A March 1, 2023, VA Care Coordinator spoke with the Veteran's partner, who reported his symptoms at that time. The Veteran was not taking his medication, so his partner now watched him to make sure that he did. She described "some degree of outbursts" of verbally abusive behavior. She felt that in the prior week the Veteran had had difficulty making reasonable decisions about organizing the day, and had episodes of being unable to make himself understood. He had depression and anxiety, but did not have hallucinations, delusions, mania, or suicidal or homicidal ideations. In the last 90 days, he had not become so agitated or disoriented that his safety was affected. See March 1, 2023, VA Care Coordination Home Telehealth Note. 

D. Discussion 

After a holistic review of all of the evidence and resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture across the period on review more nearly approximates occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

At the outset, the Board notes that because the symptoms of the Veteran's depressive disorder and insomnia have been determined to be undifferentiable, the two conditions will be rated together with consideration of all of the symptoms of each. See generally Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998).

The Veteran's psychiatric disorders create significant social impairment. The February 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran had difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, and the Veteran reported in September 2022 that he had to leave his daughter's wedding early due to his anxiety and stress. See September 11, 2022, VA Primary Care Note. The Veteran has also continuously been reported as having anger outbursts; as recently as March 2023, the Veteran's partner reported some outbursts of verbally abusive behavior, and the Veteran and his siblings submitted statements attesting to his problems with anger. See March 1, 2023, VA Care Coordination Home Telehealth Note; February 2023 Veteran Statement (reporting a history of anger problems with "outburst[s]"); March 2022 Letters from P.A. and M.R. ("anger issues"); see also March 2022 D.E. Statement ("he will yell"); March 24, 2022, VA Psychology Note (the Veteran's family "very concerned" about problems including irritability). The Board finds these symptoms akin to impaired impulse control such as unprovoked irritability with periods of verbal violence.

The Veteran's partner has also described social impairment with family and friends caused by the Veteran's mood changes. See March 2022 D.E. Letter (describing "mood swings" that "come out of nowhere," going "from laughing [to] shut down and won't talk"). The Veteran's sisters, too, noted that the Veteran distances himself from family and friends, see March 2022 Letters from P.A. and M.R., and the Veteran himself has stated "that he does best staying away from others." See May 4, 2022, VA Psychology Note; see also March 23, 2022, VA Psychology Note ("avoids most people"). Moreover, on at least two occasions the Veteran reported suicidal ideation. See June 21, 2022, VA Suicide Screen & February 8, 2023, VA Examination. The Veteran and his partner said there were "many situations where the [Veteran's] symptoms disrupted family life and ability to participate in social situations." See April 23, 2022, VA Psychology Consult. These symptoms more nearly approximate social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

Cognitively, the Veteran has had continuous "memory loss" and "memory issues." Indeed, his initial compensation claim was for "memory loss," see January 26, 2022, Form 21-526EZ, and in a March 2022 letter his partner reported that the Veteran would ask a question and then ask the same question again just 10 to 15 minutes later. See March 2022 D.E. Letter. She reported in March 2023 that the Veteran still had trouble remembering to take his medications. See March 1, 2023, VA Care Coordination Note. A July 2022 medical record from a private neurologist recorded the Veteran's report of memory problems as well as "word finding problems." See July 11, 2022, Dr. R.A.D. Note. At the time of the March 2023 report, the Veteran's partner also said the Veteran had experienced difficulty making reasonable decisions about organizing his day, and had episodes of being unable to make himself understood. The Board views these symptoms as akin to impairment of short-term memory and intermittently illogical speech. Overall, these symptoms appear to result in occupational and social impairment somewhere between reducing reliability and productivity and creating deficiencies in most areas, but more nearly approximating the latter. 

The Board also notes here the impacts of the Veteran's sleep disturbances. One of the Veteran's March 2022 claims was for "sleep disturbances," and it was one of the core symptoms for which the Veteran began seeking mental health treatment. The Veteran said in April 2022 that he would wake up with panic attacks and nightmares, and occasionally he would pace most of the night. See April 28, 2022, VA Sleep Clinic Consult. In May 2022, he alleged that he was unemployable due in part to not being able to sleep through the night. See May 17, 2022, Form 21-526EZ. The Board notes that in July 2022 the Veteran attributed his poor sleep "to not having [a] CPAP machine yet," which he said caused fatigue and cognitive difficulties the next day; however, competent medical evaluators have determined that the Veteran's insomnia manifests in significant sleep disturbances, and it has not been substantiated that the Veteran is competent to differentiate between the precise causes of his sleep disturbances (that is, that he could attribute his sleep disturbances to not having a CPAP for sleep apnea). In the absence of any other evidence differentiating the cause of the Veteran's sleep disturbances, the Board will attribute them to his service-connected psychiatric disorders. See Mittleider, 11 Vet. App. at 182. The Board finds that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's sleep disturbances and resulting cognitive difficulties substantially contribute to occupational and social impairment that more nearly approximates deficiencies in most areas.

Overall, resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that his psychiatric disorders manifest in a disability pictures more nearly approximating occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas across the entire period on review. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. Therefore, a rating of 70 percent is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

The Board further finds, however, that a rating higher than 70 percent is not warranted at any time during the period on review, because the Veteran's symptoms do not more nearly approximate total occupational and social impairment. The evidence establishes that the Veteran maintains social relationships with his partner and with his children. The Veteran's memory loss never approximated memory loss for names of close relatives or his own name or occupation, and his thought processes have never been found to be grossly impaired or delusional. The Veteran reported two instances of suicidal ideation, but he denied suicidal ideation across the rest of the period, and he has never been found to be in persistent danger of hurting himself or others. Overall, the Board does not find that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms have ever more nearly approximated total occupational and social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Accordingly, an initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for depressive disorder with insomnia is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 

III. TDIU

The Veteran has expressly raised entitlement to a TDIU. See, e.g., May 17, 2022, Form 21-526EZ (claiming "Unemployability"); March 5, 2024, Attorney Argument. Entitlement to a TDIU may be warranted as part and parcel of the Veteran's increased-rating claims for his psychiatric disorders. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 448, 449 (2009).

After reviewing all of the evidence, the Board finds that it is insufficient to grant a TDIU.

A TDIU may be assigned when a claimant is unemployable as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). In the context of a TDIU, unemployability means an inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. Id. VA determines whether the claimant has the physical and mental ability to perform the types of activities required for substantially gainful employment, with consideration given to the claimant's level of education, skills and training, and previous work experience. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72-73 (2019). A substantially gainful occupation is one earning more than marginal income, as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 72-73. Even if earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold, marginal employment may be found to exist on a facts-found basis where there is evidence including, but not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop. Id. 

Whether a veteran is capable of substantially gainful employment is a determination ultimately made by the Board. Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 218 (2007). When assessing the evidence, the Board evaluates its competency, credibility, and probative value. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); e.g., Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that the Board's role is to assess the competency, credibility, and weight of all evidence).

In this case, the Veteran submitted a May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ asserting unemployability, followed by an August 2022 VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability). See May 17, 2022, VA Form 526EZ & August 1, 2022, VA Form 21-8940. On the Form 21-8940, the Veteran wrote that he had worked in insurance sales until March 15, 2022, when he became too disabled to work. See August 1, 2022, VA Form 21-8940. His attorney continues to argue that this is the last date on which he last worked. See January 19, 2024, Argument Letter ("VA should grant the Veteran entitlement to TDIU from March 2022, the date he last worked.").

But at treatment sessions after March 2022, the Veteran made statements to his providers that suggested he continued to work. In May 2022, the Veteran messaged his primary care provider that he still held his job, that he was applying for short-term disability, and that he intended to keep his job, with a stated goal of returning to work by June 25, 2022. See May 19, 2022, Primary Care Secure Messaging ("The date for return to work is June 25th is the goal"; "HR said for me to keep my job I need to file for short term disability."). At a June 2022 psychiatric treatment session, the Veteran said that he had "caught pneumonia" and "thinks he will lose his job because he has not been able to go to work because, 'I can't breathe.'" See June 4, 2022, VA Psychiatric Outpatient Note. Later in June 2022, a pain management consult recorded the Veteran's "Working status" as "Working less frequently due to the pain," with a note of "Occupation: Sports Official - Baseball." See June 21, 2022, VA Pain Management Consult. 

The Veteran submitted his Form 21-8940 on August 1, 2022, but still more records exist after that that call into question whether he stopped working on March 5, 2022. On August 5, 2022, a provider noted that the Veteran's employer was "requesting blood work ... for the next part of the paperwork for his ADA paperwork." See August 5, 2022, Addendum to VA Primary Care Secure Messaging. And in October 2022, the Veteran messaged his primary care provider, "The company I work for is asking for a letter letting them know that I'm ok to work." See October 14, 2022, VA Primary Care Secure Messaging.

To establish entitlement to a TDIU, it is the Veteran's burden to prove that his service-connected disabilities render him unable to perform the types of occupational activities he would otherwise be qualified for, as shown by the types of work in which he has education, skills, training, and previous work experience. Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 72-73. The Veteran's capacity to perform occupational activities in which he has education, skills and training, and previous experience is in significant part informed by the Veteran's work history, including any work he may have performed during the period for which a TDIU is sought.

Here, in light of the Veteran's multiple reports to his care providers of continued employment in some capacity, the Board finds his statements that he last worked in March 2022 unreliable and therefore of insufficient probative value to establish unemployability. To be clear, the Board is not finding that the Veteran in fact worked after March 2022; perhaps he remained technically employed but was not actually working, or perhaps he was able to intermittently officiate sports but at an income level that would not constitute substantially gainful employment. What the Board finds, rather, is that the evidence of record is not sufficient to make these determinations. And the burden to submit sufficient evidence to allow the Board to soundly make those determinations ultimately rests on the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a) ("[A] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits."); Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing Cromer v. Nicholson, 455 F.3d 1346, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).

To be sure, VA may have had a duty to assist the Veteran in carrying his burden by, for example, requesting a clarification of his employment history through 2022. But the Veteran, through his attorney, waived his right to that development and requested a decision based on the evidence of record. As the Board concluded above, the waiver was intentional, voluntary, and freely made, as made clear by the Veteran's attorney, who is "presume[d] to be versed in the facts of the case and to know and to understand the law as it relates to those facts." Janssen, 15 Vet. App. at 374. They requested instead a decision based only on the evidence already of record, and so the Board honors that request. Id.

Because the evidence of record is not sufficient to soundly determine and conclude that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unemployable, a TDIU is not warranted. The claim for entitlement to a TDIU is denied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
