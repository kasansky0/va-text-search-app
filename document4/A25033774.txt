FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for chronic kidney disease was denied in August 2012. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, and new and material evidence was not received, within one year of the notice of decision. The decision became final. 

2. The Veteran submitted an incomplete claim for service connection for benefits on January 10, 2021, and within a year, submitted a complete supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence; thereafter, he continuously pursued his claim from January 10, 2021.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of January 10, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 1973 to June 1977 and August 1977 to August 1979.

As an initial matter, on August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law, which went into effect in February 2019, creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review.

In a February 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for diabetic nephropathy with chronic kidney disease and special monthly compensation based on housebound criteria. The Veteran submitted a higher level of review request in August 2023. In a December 2023 rating, a 60 percent evaluation was assigned for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy effective November 14, 2021, and 100 percent evaluation was assigned effective May 26, 2022.  Also, a new effective date of June 27, 2022, was assigned for the grant of special monthly compensation based on housebound status and an effective date of May 26, 2022, was assigned for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35. In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) where he selected the Direct Review lane. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 14, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension 

Section 5110(a) of title 38, U.S. Code, governs the assignment of an effective date for an award of benefits: The effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The implementing regulation similarly states that except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1. The amended regulations, however, apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015. Thus, prior to March 24, 2015, the standardized forms were not required.

The AMA system applies to all claims, and requests for reopening of finally adjudicated claims, for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400. Under AMA, instead of filing to reopen a previously denied claim with new and material evidence, Veterans must file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160 (e), 3.2501. In other words, to have a claim that was previously denied in a final Legacy decision readjudicated after the effective date of the AMA's implementation on February 19, 2019, a Veteran is required to file a supplemental claim and submit new and relevant evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

After the AOJ adjudicates an AMA claim the Veteran has one year to file a request for a higher-level review, a supplemental claim, or review by the Board. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

In an August 2012 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for a kidney condition. The Veteran was notified of the decision, and his appellate rights, by letter dated in August 2012. The Veteran did not appeal that decision, and new and material evidence was not received, within one year of the notice of decision. The decision became final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.200-204 (2012).

On January 10, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, for service connection for a kidney condition. On January 11, 2021, the AOJ notified the Veteran that his intent to file had been received. On March 29, 2021, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim for service connection for a kidney condition associated with hypertension. In May 2021, the Veteran's claim for service connection was denied. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim in February 2022. The claim was denied again in May 2022. In October 2022, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim. 

In a February 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for diabetic nephropathy with chronic kidney disease. He was assigned an evaluation of 100 percent, effective October 13, 2022. In August 2023, the Veteran requested a higher level of review. In a December 2023 rating decision, a 60 percent evaluation was assigned for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy effective November 14, 2021, and 100 percent evaluation was assigned effective May 26, 2022. 

The Veteran argues that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than November 14, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy. The Board agrees. To that end, as noted above, the August 2012 rating decision denying service connection for kidney disease became final. The Veteran attempted to reopen the claim for service connection for a kidney condition on January 10, 2021, but he did not use the proper form required for readjudication under the AMA system. On March 29, 2021, however, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim on proper form, along with the mandatory new and relevant evidence. Thus, within a year of the Veteran's January 10, 2021, claim on the improper form, he submitted a completed and proper supplemental claim and he has continuously pursued his claim.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), the Board considers the VA Form 21-526EZ received on January 10. 2021, to be an incomplete claim as the Veteran did not file the correct form prescribed by the Secretary to readjudicate a finally decided claim on or after February 19, 2019. However, the VA received the Veteran's completed supplemental claim on the proper form within one year of the January 10, 2021, claim. Since a complete claim was submitted within one year of the receipt of the incomplete application form prescribed by the Secretary, the VA will consider it as filed as of the date the VA received the incomplete application form that did not meet the standards of a complete claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Furthermore, in January 2021, the Veteran submitted an opinion and treatment records from his private physician Dr. K. who expressed that the Veteran had been under his care for chronic kidney disease and that he had underwent a kidney biopsy in October 2020. Dr. K further expressed that the Veteran's kidney biopsy findings suggested that hypertension played a major role in his renal dysfunction. These findings confirm that the Veteran had chronic kidney disease prior to January 10, 2021. Accordingly, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of January 10, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. 

Lastly, there are no formal and/or informal claims for service connection for chronic kidney disease between the final August 2012 AOJ denial of service connection and January 10, 2021. Thus, an effective date of January 10, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension is granted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

In light of the earlier effective date of January 10, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease, the Board finds that further development is warranted. To that end, a rating has not been assigned for the time period from January 10, 2021, to November 14, 2021. As the Board may not adjudicate an issue in the first instance without prior AOJ consideration, a remand is warranted so the AOJ can assign an initial rating in the first instance. See Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 394 (1993). 

Furthermore, as the claims for entitlement to an initial rating higher than 60 percent for diabetic nephropathy with chronic kidney disease from November 14, 2021 to May 26, 2022, an effective date earlier than June 27, 2022 for the grant of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status and an effective date earlier than May 26, 2022 for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35 are inextricably intertwined with the rating assigned for chronic kidney disease prior to November 14, 2021, these claims must also be remanded. See Parker v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 116 (1994); Harris v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

Under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of any error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim, not just pre-decisional duty to assist errors. Accordingly, the claim is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ must implement the Board's award of an initial effective date of January 10, 2021, for the grant of service connection for chronic kidney disease with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. The AOJ should then assign a disability rating for the grant of service connection for the time from January 10, 2021, to November 14, 2021.

Upon completion of the above requested development, the AOJ must readjudicate the intertwined issues of entitlement to an initial rating higher than 60 percent for diabetic nephropathy with chronic kidney disease from November 14, 2021, to May 26, 2022, an effective date earlier than June 27, 2022 for the grant of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound status and an effective date earlier than May 26, 2022 for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35.
