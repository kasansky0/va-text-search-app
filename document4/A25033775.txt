DOCKET NO. 240226-419104
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 6, 2020, but not earlier, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The medical and other evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and occupational experience effective January 6, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 6, 2020, for the award of a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, 4.16(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1983 to October 1983; and from December 1984 to May 1986.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2023 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Specifically, the Board has considered evidence received prior to the August 23, 2023 rating decision. Any evidence submitted after August 23, 2023 is ineligible for review. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates

In general, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final adjudication of compensation, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of the receipt of the application. 38 U.S.C. §5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a claim for an earlier effective date for a TDIU. Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). The effective date for a TDIU claim is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for TDIU is the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. §5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §3.400 (o)(2).

The Court has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating. See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, supra.

The Court has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates. A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a).

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

In determining an effective date for an award of a TDIU, VA must make two essential determinations. It must determine (1) when a claim for TDIU was received, and (2) when a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred so as to warrant entitlement to TDIU. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2).

Entitlement to an effective date of January 6, 2020, but not earlier, for the grant of TDIU is granted.

The Veteran first filed a TDIU claim, via a VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, in September 2004. He claimed that he became too disabled to work in January 2004, due to diabetes and a mental illness. The claim was denied by way of a November 2004 rating decision. At the time, he was service connected for diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy of each lower extremity, and erectile dysfunction. He was rated as 70 percent disabled. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the decision. Consequently, the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2004); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.202, 20.1103 (2004).  

The Veteran filed an informal claim for TDIU in January 2007. The claim was denied again by way of an April 2007 rating decision. Once again, the Veteran did not appeal the decision, and no new and material evidence was received within one year of the decision. Consequently, the decision became final. Id.

The Veteran filed another TDIU claim (VA Form 21-8940) in January 2011. The Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations to take place in June 2012, but he failed to report for the examinations; and his claim was denied by way of an August 2012 rating decision. He submitted a March 2013 notice of disagreement, but failed to perfect his appeal by filing a timely VA Form 9 (or other substantive appeal) in response to a September 2015 statement of the case. Consequently, the decision became final.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

On October 7, 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for increased ratings for bilateral lower extremity neuritis, and for a TDIU. The AOJ sent an October 2019 correspondence in which he was asked to submit a VA Form 21-8940,Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. He failed to do so, and his claim was denied by way of an April 2020 rating decision. The rating decision also denied increased ratings for lower extremity neuritis; and it granted service connection for upper extremity neuritis. 

The Veteran submitted an Intent to File on May 28, 2020. He submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ claim on June 12, 2020. On the claim cover sheet, the Veteran stated "New evidence for increase in % from 90% to 100%. New diagnosis of retinopathy related to service connected disability of diabetes mellitus I." Along with the claim, he submitted a VA Form 21-4138 in which he stated that his service-connected diabetes mellitus had increased in severity and included diabetic retinopathy. He submitted records from Texas Retina Associates and Vision Site to substantiate his contentions. 

In a June 17, 2020, letter, the AOJ informed the Veteran that his June 12, 2020, claim was incomplete. He was advised that if VA received a completed application within one year from the date it received his incomplete June 2020 application, VA would consider his claim filed as of the date of receipt of his incomplete application. 

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for diabetes mellitus, diabetic neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure, and severe hyperglycemic episodes. However, that claim also was incomplete. 

The Veteran resubmitted a complete claim on October 19, 2020. The issues included were entitlement to service connection for diabetic retinopathy and high blood pressure, and entitlement to a higher rating for diabetes (claimed a 'severe hypoglycemic episodes.')

He submitted another Intent to File from in November 2020; however, no claim was received within one year of this form.

Service connection for hypertension and diabetic retinopathy was granted by way of a December 2010 rating decision. Entitlement to a higher rating for diabetes was deferred.

A June 2021 rating decision granted an increased rating for the diabetic retinopathy with an effective date of May 28, 2020. The rating for diabetes mellitus was continued. The AOJ also proposed to reduce the ratings for upper extremity peripheral neuritis. The ratings for upper extremity peripheral neuritis were reduced to noncompensable by way of an August 2021 rating decision. 

The Veteran submitted a VA 21-0966 Intent to File in November 2021.

He also submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher-Level Review of the June 2021 rating decision, but only with respect to the proposed reduction of the bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuritis. 

The AOJ issued a July 2022 Supplemental Claim rating decision in which it restored the previously reduced ratings for right and left upper extremity peripheral neuritis. It also granted an increased rating (to 30 percent) for right upper extremity peripheral neuritis, effective March 15, 2022.  

The Veteran submitted a claim for a TDIU (VA Form 21-8940) that was received on March 15, 2023. The AOJ issued the August 2023 rating decision on appeal in which it granted a TDIU effective March 28, 2022. Following an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher-Level Review from the Veteran, the AOJ  then issued Higher Level Review rating decison in which it changed the effective date to March 15, 2022 (one year prior to the date that the claim was received). 

Analysis

The Veteran argues that the effective date of the TDIU should be at least as early as October 7, 2019 (the date in which he filed a claim for TDIU and for increased ratings for neuritis). He argues that his TDIU claim has been continuously pursued since that time.

As noted above, in October 2019, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for increased ratings for bilateral lower extremity neuritis, and for a TDIU. These claims were denied by way of an April 2020 rating decision.  

A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options, on the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues a notice of decision on a claim or issue as specified (except as otherwise provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c), (e), and (f)), after any decision by the AOJ: (1) Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Within one year of the April 2020 rating decision, the Veteran did not submit a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board. Instead, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File in May 2020 and a VA Form 21-526EZ new claim in June 2020. He cited a new diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. 

The Court has recognized and upheld the important distinctions between the AMA VA Forms, such as the supplemental claim (filed on a VA Form 20-0995) and a "new" claim (filed on a VA Form 21-526EZ). See, e.g., Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024) (holding that a new claim is distinct from a supplemental claim and, therefore, cannot be considered "continuous pursuit" for purposes of effective dates or for purposes of attorney fees).

In light of the fact that the Veteran did not submit a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board within one year of the April 2020 rating decision, the Board finds that the Veteran did not pursue his TDIU claim continuously from October 2019; and the April 2020 rating decision became final. 

On May 28, 2020, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File. In the ensuing claims dated June 2020, August 2020 (incomplete), and October 2020 (completed), the Veteran stated that he had new evidence in support of an increase from 90 percent to 100 percent based on diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, diabetic neuropathy, and severe hyperglycemic episodes. These claims also included entitlement a TDIU that the Board finds was reasonably raised by the record pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

The AOJ issued rating decisions in June 2021 and August 2021; and the Veteran has continuously pursued increased ratings, to include a TDIU, since then. He continuously pursued the claims by submitting a VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher-Level Review in November 2021, which the AOJ adjudicated in a July 2022 Supplemental Claim rating decision because a duty to assist error was found. 

The Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU (via a VA Form 21-8940) that was received on March 15, 2023, within one year of the July 2022 rating decision. 

Recently, the Court of Appeal for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that, because a request for a TDIU is not a standalone claim but an attempt to obtain an increased rating, a TDIU application could, on a case by case basis, serve as a supplemental claim when it is filed after VA has already denied higher ratings for the disabilities at issue. Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336. The Board finds that in this particular case, the Veteran's March 15, 2023, TDIU should be deemed a supplemental claim to the July 2022 rating decision. 

Based on the procedural history discussed above, the July 2022 rating decision was in response to increased rating and TDIU claims that have been continuously pursued since the May 28, 2020, ITF (and June 12, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ). Thus, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim for a TDIU from the May 28, 2020, Intent to File. 

Having established that the Veteran's claim was received on May 28, 2020, the Board must also determine the date that entitlement arose. As noted above, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

The term "substantially gainful occupation" is not defined in the rating schedule. Rather, the Court in Ray v. Wilkie, found the phrase has two components: an economic one and a noneconomic one. 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). In assessing the Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the Board is to consider the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training as well as physical abilities and mental abilities required by the occupation at issue. Id. Such specific physical ability-factors include lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory, and visual. Id. Specific mental ability-factors include memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work-place stress, getting along with coworkers, and demonstrating reliability and productivity. Id. 

The Veteran has asserted that he last worked in 2004. Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) reflect that the Veteran stopped working as a result on non-service-connected psychiatric disabilities. The Board must determine when his service-connected disabilities (diabetes mellitus, upper and lower extremity neuritis, retinopathy, hypertension, and erectile dysfunction) result in impairment so severe that they preclude him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and occupational experience.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination on January 6, 2020, during which the examiner found that peripheral neuritis of the lower extremities would cause the Veteran to be limited by decreased physical stamina and endurance, heavy exertion, prolonged standing and walking, impaired motor coordination, balance, ability to climb ladder or work at heights, limited tolerance to extreme temperatures and long hours without rest. The examiner also found that peripheral neuritis of the bilateral upper extremities would cause the Veteran to be limited with difficulty gripping, carrying and lifting items, as well opening jars, turning knobs, opening doors, dressing, grooming, writing and typing due to numbness, tingling and paresthesias. The report reflects that the Veteran had complete paralysis of the right and left external popliteal nerves. However, a March 2020 VA addendum opinion reflects that "that was obviously an error" as it would mean that the Veteran would not be able to ambulate. The March 2020 opinion reflects that a more accurate assessment would be that the Veteran suffered from moderate incomplete paralysis. 

The Board notes that according to the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 21-8940, he previously worked as a mail handler for the U.S. Postal Service, and that he completed high school but did not go to college. The Board finds that the neuritis in the Veteran's legs would preclude him from employment due to lack of stamina and endurance, impaired motor control, and the inability to work long hours without rest. It is unclear what types of non-physically strenuous employment would be suited to the Veteran; however, the Board believes that the neuritis in his upper extremities would preclude even non-physically strenuous employment or employment where he works primarily in a seated position. The examiner specifically noted that amongst other things, the Veteran would have difficulty with tasks like writing and typing, due to tingling and paresthesias in his upper extremities. Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran has met the criteria for a TDIU effective January 6, 2020. 

If an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the proper effective date is the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable). In this case, the date that entitlement arose is January 6, 2020, which is within one year of the receipt of the claim (May 28, 2020). Consequently, an effective date of January 6, 2020 for the grant of a TDIU is warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
