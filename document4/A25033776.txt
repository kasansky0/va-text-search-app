ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2018 for the award of service connection for hypothyroidism is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2018 for the award of service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

Entitlement to an initial rating higher than 10 percent for hypothyroidism is dismissed.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, the Board denied entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension; the Board's March 2025 decision is final and there is no other appeal addressing the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension pending before the Board at this time.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of an appeal by the Board, as to the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to August 1971, which includes service in Thailand.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from August and November 2024 rating decisions.

In a December 23, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Board's Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August and November 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the December 23, 2024 VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As for characterization of the issues on appeal, the Veteran also listed a November 1971 rating decision on his December 2024 Form 10182 and noted "neglect of important medical information." However, as the November 1971 rating decision was issued prior to the February 19, 2019 effective date of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), that decision may not be appealed under the modernized review system. Regardless, the December 2024 Form 10182 was not received within one year of the issuance of the November 1971 decision. The Veteran has not shown good cause for failure to follow the important and mandatory claims processing rule requiring that an NOD to the Board be filed within one year of mailing of notice of the decision and there is otherwise no basis for waiver or forfeiture. Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 271 (2024) (38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) "sets forth a well-established regulatory standard for seeking acceptance of an untimely NOD"); id. at 269 ("The Board thus erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Mr. Ferko's appeal because his NOD was not filed within section 7105(b)'s one-year period. This doesn't mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant.  It is an "important and mandatory" component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule. Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435. Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced." Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017). Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness"). Therefore, no further discussion of the November 1971 rating decision is necessary.

As a final preliminary matter, in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the AMA has elapsed. In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new notice of disagreement within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony. 

In this case, the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has not yet elapsed. However, the Veteran submitted additional evidence in connection with his appeal with his December 2024 Form 10182. Therefore, a Board docket switch is now precluded. Williams, 37 Vet. App. at 305; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2).

Entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d). In addition, although Article III of the U.S. Constitution does not apply to administrative bodies such as the Board, the underlying concepts such as mootness apply to the extent they can be inferred from statutes and regulations. Akard v. McDonough, No. 2021-1383, 2021 U.S. App. LEXIS 36633 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 13, 2021) (nonprecedential).

In this case, the AOJ awarded service connection for hypothyroidism and hypertension and assigned initial noncompensable disability ratings, both from May 29, 2018, by way of the August 2024 rating decision. In the November 2024 rating decision, the AOJ readjudicated the effective date and initial rating assigned for hypothyroidism and denied entitlement to an earlier effective date and higher initial rating. The AOJ explained that the November 2024 decision was issued in order to include information and a discussion about the federal court order in Nehmer v. United States Department of Veterans Affairs. The AOJ did not adjudicate any other issues in the August and November 2024 decisions.

The current appeal was docketed under the Board's Evidence Submission docket following its receipt of the Veteran's December 23, 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran identified the August and November 2024 decisions on the Form 10182 and suggested that earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings were warranted for the only disabilities addressed in those decisions (i.e., hypothyroidism and hypertension). However, the Veteran had previously submitted a VA Form 10182 on October 3, 2024, on which he appealed the effective dates and initial ratings assigned for hypothyroidism and hypertension, and selected the Board's Evidence Submission docket. His October 2024 appeal was also placed on the Board's docket.

In a March 2025 decision, the Board adjudicated the Veteran's appeal received on October 3, 2024. In that decision, the Board denied entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension. The Board also awarded a separate 10 percent rating, but no higher, for residuals of hypothyroidism, to include cold sensitivity. The Board's March 2025 decision was final when issued. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (a) (a Board decision is final on the date stamped on the face of the decision). It does not appear a supplemental claim has been filed, the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension have not been re-adjudicated by the AOJ following the Board's March 2025 decision, and there is no other appeal addressing these issues pending before the Board at this time.

In sum, the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates and higher initial ratings for hypothyroidism and hypertension are no longer before the Board and there remains no specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. Therefore, pursuant to the applicable statute, the Board will dismiss the appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a) ("All questions in a matter which under section 511(a) of this title is subject to decision by the Secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary"), 7105 (d).

As noted, a Board decision is final on the date stamped on the face of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (a). The only exceptions to this rule are if the Chairman of the Board orders reconsideration, see 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (a) or, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (b), there is district court jurisdiction (38 U.S.C. § 1975), a life insurance suit (38 U.S.C. § 1984), housing and small business loans (38 U.S.C., chapter 37), or an appeal to the Court (38 U.S.C., chapter 72). Should the Veteran disagree with the Board's March 2025 decision, this decision does not preclude him from filing a motion alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the Board's decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1404. He may also file a supplemental claim, as discussed in the introduction above and the instructions below. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(3) ("Following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims"); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 102-03 (2024) (continuous pursuit under the AMA renders a Board decision non-final).
