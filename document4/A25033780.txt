DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 12, 2022, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File on August 12, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of August 12, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1994 to May 1997. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 16, 2024, for service-connected major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder. More specifically, the Veteran contends that the effective date for the grant of service connection should be August 12, 2022 (the date VA received the Veteran's Intent to File). See September 2024 Correspondence. Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date of August 12, 2022, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder is warranted.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim is received within one year following separation, the effective date of an award of compensation shall be the day following separation from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

An effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). However, VA may also grant entitlement to benefits from an effective date prior to the date the claim was received as long as a complete claim is received within one year of receipt of the VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File. When the complete claim is received within one year of the intent to file, the effective date rules may be applied based on the intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

In other words, the critical question in this matter is when did the Veteran first file a claim seeking service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder (as the effective date of an award of service connection cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of the claim, unless the claim was filed within one year following separation from service, the claim was filed within one year following a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File, or if the award of compensation is due to a liberalizing change in the law or an administrative issue).

In the instant case, on August 12, 2022, the VA received a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File, which was acknowledged by VA in an August 19, 2022, letter. In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for anxiety and depression. An April 2023 rating decision deferred a decision on entitlement to service connection and a September 2023 rating decision denied service connection. In October 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review and a February 2024 rating decision detected a duty to assist error. An August 2024 rating decision granted service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder with an evaluation of 30 percent effective February 16, 2024. The Veteran subsequently filed a September 2024 VA Form 10182 appealing the claim to the Board and requesting an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection. 

Upon a review of the procedural history, the Board finds that an effective date of August 12, 2022, for the grant of service connection is warranted. As noted above, an effective date of an award of service connection is based on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA. Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. 382. In the instant case, the VA received an Intent to File on August 12, 2022. Within one year, the Veteran submitted a January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ seeking service connection for anxiety and depression. The Veteran continuously pursued the claim and entitlement to service connection was eventually awarded pursuant to the August 2024 rating decision. It follows that the date of the application upon which service connection was eventually granted was August 12, 2022, and, thus, such is the appropriate effective date for the grant of service connection.

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 12, 2022, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder is warranted.
