REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1986 to February 2007. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from May 2023, July 2023, August 2023, October 2023, and January 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). 

With regard to procedural history, a May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy; granted a 20 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD; and denied higher ratings for a left knee strain, right elbow scar, and hypertension. 

In June 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for higher ratings for right lower extremity radiculopathy, a left knee strain, a right elbow scar, hypertension, and lumbar spine DDD, and a supplemental claim for service connection for PTSD and a left shoulder disability. Later in June 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for sinusitis. 

In a July 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for a surgical scar below the right clavicle, allergic rhinitis, and erectile dysfunction; a higher rating was denied for lumbar spine DDD; and service connection was denied for a right knee disability, sinusitis, and bilateral hip disabilities. 

In an August 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for PTSD; higher ratings were denied for lumbar spine DDD, right lower extremity radiculopathy, left knee strain, a right elbow scar, and hypertension. 

In an October 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for a left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis. 

In December 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review (HLR) of the ratings assigned for hypertension, left knee strain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and right elbow scar in the August 2023 rating decision; requested HLR of the rating and effective date assigned to the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction in the July 2023 rating decision; requested HLR of the ratings assigned for allergic rhinitis and surgical scar below the right clavicle in the July 2023 rating decision; requested HLR of the denial of service connection bilateral hip disabilities, a right knee disability, and sinusitis in the July 2023 rating decision; requested HLR of the rating and effective date assigned to the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy in the May 2023 rating decision; and requested HLR of the ratings assigned for hypertension, left knee strain, and right elbow scar in the May 2023 rating decision. 

A January 2024 HLR rating decision denied earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy and erectile dysfunction; denied higher ratings for hypertension, left knee strain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, right elbow scar, erectile dysfunction, rhinitis, and a surgical scar below the right clavicle; and denied service connection for bilateral hip disabilities and sinusitis. A duty-to-assist error was identified with respect to the claim for service connection for a right knee disability, and that claim was returned for correction of the error. 

In a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran appealed the January 2024 HLR rating decision to the extent that it denied earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for erectile dysfunction and right lower extremity radiculopathy; denied higher ratings for allergic rhinitis, erectile dysfunction, hypertension, left knee strain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, right elbow scar, and a surgical scar below the right clavicle; and denied service connection for bilateral hip disabilities and sinusitis. The Veteran appealed the October 2023 rating decision assigning an initial rating and effective date for the award of service connection for left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis. The Veteran appealed the August 2023 rating decision to the extent that it denied an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD; denied higher ratings for PTSD, lumbar spine DDD, hypertension, left knee strain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and a right elbow scar. The Veteran appealed the July 2023 rating decision to the extent that it denied earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for erectile dysfunction, allergic rhinitis, and surgical scar below the right clavicle; denied higher ratings for lumbar spine DDD, erectile dysfunction, allergic rhinitis, and a surgical scar below the right clavicle; and denied service connection for bilateral hip disabilities, a right knee disability, and sinusitis. The Veteran also appealed the May 2023 rating decision to the extent that it denied higher ratings for hypertension, left knee strain, and right elbow scar. 

With respect to the rating and effective date assigned to the award of service connection for left shoulder strain with rotator cuff, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. With respect to the rating and effective date assigned to the award of service connection for PTSD and the ratings assigned for hypertension, left knee strain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, right elbow scar, and lumbar spine DDD, the Board can only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision. see 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f) (the evidentiary record in a HLR is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the prior decision under review). With respect to the ratings and effective dates assigned to the awards of service connection for erectile dysfunction, allergic rhinitis, and surgical scar below the right clavicle, and the claims for service connection for bilateral hip disabilities, a right knee disability, and sinusitis, the Board can only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision. See id. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the aforementioned decisions. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

The Board notes that in June 2023 written statement, the Veteran's spouse indicated that the Veteran no longer works due to his back pain, knee pain, and high blood pressure. A claim for a total disability rating based on individual employability (TDIU) is part of an increased rating claim where a veteran submits evidence of unemployability related to the underlying condition. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). However, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating and special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) throughout the period on appeal for the claims for higher ratings for lumbar spine DDD, left knee strain, and hypertension. Therefore, the issue of entitlement to TDIU is moot. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008).

Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or a supplemental claim will      be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is    later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). If the increase in disability occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the effective date for an increased rating is the date of receipt of the claim. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined as "formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). An informal claim included "[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits..." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014). Claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, must be submitted on the application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). 

Under the legacy appeal system, which generally applies to rating decisions issued before February 19, 2019, a determination on a claim by the AOJ became final unless an appeal was perfected or new and material evidence was received within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of the de

cision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2018). An appeal consisted of a timely filed notice of disagreement in writing and, after an SOC has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.200 (2018). A timely substantive appeal is one filed in writing within 60 days from the date the SOC was mailed, or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b) (2018). After a decision became final, the claim could be reopened if new and material evidence was presented. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. The effective date of an award of compensation based on a claim reopened after a final disallowance is the date of receipt of the claim to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever was later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r) (2018).  

Under the modernized review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), which generally applies to decisions issued on or after February 19, 2019, a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of these administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim      or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). If a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issued notice of a prior decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).  

When a benefit is awarded pursuant to a liberalizing law or VA issue approved by the Secretary or by the Secretary's direction, the effective date of such award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the act. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a). If a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA within one year from the effective date of the law or VA issue, or at the request of a claimant received within one year from that date, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law or VA issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1). If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3). In order for a claimant to be eligible for a retroactive payment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, the evidence must show that the claimant met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a). 

The effective date for an award of service connection for a disability granted on a secondary basis can be no earlier than the effective date for the award of service connection for the primary disability. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 59 (2011).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of service connection for PTSD

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in August 2012, which was denied in an April 2013 rating decision. In April 2013, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement to that decision. An SOC sent to the Veteran in April 2014 confirmed the denial of service connection for PTSD. The Veteran did not submit a substantive appeal within 60 days of the date the April 2014 SOC was mailed, nor was new and material evidence actually or constructively received within one year of the April 2013 rating decision that was not considered in the April 2014 SOC. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); see also Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1405-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Therefore, the April 2013 rating decision became final under the laws and regulations in effect at that time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2018).  

On June 15, 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for service connection for PTSD. A review of the record reveals no communication received between the April 2014 SOC and June 15, 2023, that may be interpreted as a formal or informal claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder. Accordingly, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD is June 15, 2023. However, the Board will not disturb the June 15, 2022, effective date assigned by the AOJ. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than June 15, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis is not warranted.

The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability in September 2006, which was denied in a May 2007 rating decision. The Veteran was notified of that decision in a letter dated May 10, 2007. However, he did not submit a notice of disagreement to the denial of service connection for a left shoulder disability within one year, nor was new and material evidence actually or constructively received within one year. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); see also Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1405-07. Therefore, the denial of service connection for a left shoulder disability in the May 2007 rating decision became final under the laws and regulations in effect at that time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2018).  

On June 15, 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability. A review of the record reveals no communication received between May 7, 2007, and June 15, 2023, that may be interpreted as a formal or informal claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability. Accordingly, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for a left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis is June 15, 2023, and an earlier effective date is denied.  

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for allergic rhinitis is not warranted. 

On March 6, 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis. A review of the record reveals no communication received prior to March 6, 2023, that may be interpreted as a formal or informal claim for service connection for rhinitis. In a July 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for allergic rhinitis on a presumptive basis under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which went into effect on August 10, 2022. As the Veteran's claim for service connection for allergic rhinitis was received within one year of the PACT Act's effective date, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis is August 10, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a). Accordingly, an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis is not warranted. 

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 17, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a surgical scar below the right clavicle 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than December 17, 2022, for the award of service connection for a surgical scar below the right clavicle is not warranted.

On December 28, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for multiple myeloma. The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which the examiner indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with multiple myeloma on December 17, 2022, and he had a scar blow the right clavicle from a central line placement for multiple myeloma treatment. In a July 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for multiple myeloma based on the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) under the PACT Act. As the Veteran's claim for service connection for multiple myeloma was received within one year of the PACT Act's effective date, an effective date of December 17, 2022, was assigned based on the date the medical evidence first showed a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.114(a). Service connection was also granted for a scar below the right clavicle secondary to the Veteran's service-connected multiple myeloma. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) (service connection may also be established for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability). As the effective date for an award of service connection for a disability granted on a secondary basis can be no earlier than the effective date for the award of service connection for the primary disability, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than December 17, 2022, for the award of service connection for a scar below the left clavicle is not warranted. See DeLisio, 25 Vet. App. at 59.

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 28, 2022, for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than December 28, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.

On December 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction. A review of the record reveals no communication received prior to December 28, 2022, that may be interpreted as a formal or informal claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction. Accordingly, an effective date earlier than December 28, 2022, is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 28, 2022, for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy 

In a May 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted right lower extremity radiculopathy secondary to the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine DDD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Note (1) (when rating disabilities of the spine, neurologic abnormalities associated with spinal conditions should be assigned separate ratings under the appropriate diagnostic code).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date of October 24, 2022, but not earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

In a May 2007 rating decision, service connection was granted for a lumbar strain, and a 10 percent rating was assigned. That decision specifically noted that a neurological examination of the lower extremities was normal. In March 2008, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement to the initial rating assigned for a lumbar strain. An SOC sent to the Veteran in October 2009 confirmed the denial of a rating higher than 10 percent for a lumbar strain and again noted that a neurological examination was normal. The Veteran did not submit a substantive appeal within 60 days of the date the October 2009 SOC was mailed, nor was new and material evidence actually or constructively received within one year of the March 2008 rating decision that was not considered in the October 2009 SOC. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); see also Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1405-07. Therefore, the rating assigned for a lumbar strain, including the denial of a separate rating for associated neurologic abnormalities, became final under the laws and regulations in effect at that time. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2018).  

On December 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim a higher rating for his service-connected lumbar spine DDD. The Veteran may be entitled to an effective date up to one year prior to the date of that claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during the year preceding that claim such that a separate compensable rating was warranted for right lower extremity radiculopathy. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). Private treatment records show a diagnosis of radiculopathy due to IVDS of the lumbar spine on October 24, 2022. Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date of October 24, 2022, is warranted. 

The Board finds that an effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, is not warranted, as this is the earliest date the record shows a diagnosis of right lower extremity radiculopathy during the year preceding the Veteran's December 2022 claim for a higher rating for lumbar spine DDD. Moreover, the record shows no communication received between the October 2009 SOC and December 28, 2022, that may be interpreted as a formal or informal claim for higher rating for the Veteran's back disability or a claim for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy. Accordingly, an effective date earlier than October 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is denied. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

"Current" means near the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency, even if the disability subsequently resolves. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). "Disability" refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1359, 1363 (Fed Cir. 2018) (holding that pain resulting in functional impairment can constitute a disability even without an identified underlying diagnosis). Functional impairment in earning capacity can be demonstrated by "showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person." Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 17 (2020).

Service connection may also be established for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). A disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability may be service-connected to the degree that the aggravation is shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448-49 (1995).

7. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis 

The Veteran seeks service connection for sinusitis, which he asserts was caused by burn pit exposure during his deployment to Iraq and Qatar. 

Effective August 5, 2021, service connection may be warranted on a presumptive basis for asthma, rhinitis, sinusitis, and rhinosinusitis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(2). To do so, such disorder must become manifest to any degree (including noncompensable) within 10 years from the date of separation from military service in: (i) The Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined in § 3.317(e)(2), during the Persian Gulf War as defined in § 3.2(i); or (ii) Afghanistan, Syria, Djibouti, or Uzbekistan on or after September 19, 2001, during the Persian Gulf War as defined in § 3.2(i). 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(1), (a)(4). Such Veterans are presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter during such service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine, particulate matter during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(3). However, such diseases shall not be presumed service connected if there is affirmative evidence that: (1) the disease was not incurred during or aggravated by a qualifying period of service; (2) the disease was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the Veteran's most recent departure from a qualifying period of service and the onset of the disease; or (3) the disease is the result of the Veteran's own willful misconduct. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(b).

Although 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 (2022) requires that asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis manifest within 10 years from separation from qualifying service, as of implementation of the PACT Act, that requirement is not being enforced as per the PACT Act pre-regulatory guidance. See 87 Fed. Reg. 78543 (Dec. 22, 2022); see also VBA Letter 20-22-10 (December 22, 2022) (VA Pact Act Policy Letter for Sub-Regulatory Guidance).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of sinusitis. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997) (holding that the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation); see also See McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321.

The record confirms that the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. Therefore, he is presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter during such service, and he qualifies for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.320. However, the record does not show a current diagnosis of sinusitis. 

VA treatment records from 2010 to 2019 do not show a diagnosis of or treatment for sinusitis. Private treatment records show that between January 2023 and April 2023, the Veteran reported a past medical history of sinusitis. However, treatment records do not show a diagnosis of or treatment for sinusitis. Moreover, in January 2023, the Veteran denied symptoms of rhinorrhea, sinus pain, or sore throat. A cone beam CT scan conducted in January 2023 due to multiple myeloma revealed clear maxillary sinuses on both sides. An April 2023 PET/CT scan of the head and neck conducted due to multiple myeloma revealed clear paranasal sinuses.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which he reported having allergies from sand, dust, burn pit exposure, and heat from his service in Iraq. He reported current symptoms of runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drainage. The examiner indicated that the Veteran had a diagnosis of rhinitis, but not sinusitis. 

Although the Veteran is competent to report subjective symptoms of runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drainage, the diagnosis sinusitis requires medical expertise to determine. Thus, the opinion of the Veteran regarding the diagnosis of sinusitis is not competent medical evidence. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In this case, the Veteran's symptoms have been attributed to a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, and service connection has been granted for allergic rhinitis. Although treatment records show that the Veteran reported a past medical history of sinusitis, the record does not show a diagnosis of sinusitis near the time the Veteran's claim was filed in June 2023 or during the pendency of the claim.

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. In this case, there is no competent evidence of record showing that the Veteran has a diagnosis of sinusitis near the time the Veteran's claim was filed in June 2023 or during the pendency of the claim. Therefore, there is no basis upon which service connection can be awarded. 

As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, service connection for sinusitis is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 17, 2021).

Disability Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule of Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2020).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance.    The functional loss may be due to absence of part or all of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as disabled. See DeLuca v. Brown,   8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.45, 4.59.  Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation          of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional       loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  

8. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for allergic rhinitis 

Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is not warranted.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which he reported current symptoms of runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and post-nasal drainage. The Veteran stated that his symptoms caused him to stay inside a lot and avoid activities he would otherwise do. A physical examination revealed greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis and permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. There was no evidence of complete obstruction on either side, nasal polyps, granulomatous rhinitis, rhinoscleroma, Wegener's granulomatosis, lethal midline granuloma, or any other granulomatous infection. 

The Veteran's treatment records do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examination.

As the record does not show evidence of nasal polyps, the Board finds that a higher rating is not warranted for allergic rhinitis at any time during the period under review. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran also has permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, which warrants a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6523 (bacterial rhinitis). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6523. However, Diagnostic Codes 6522 and 6523 both contemplate greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. Therefore, separate ratings cannot be assigned under Diagnostic Codes 6522 and 6523. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses is to be avoided); Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994) (separate ratings are permissible where none of the symptomatology for one condition is duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of another condition). 

As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, a rating higher than 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

9. Entitlement to a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran is in receipt of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction, but his erectile dysfunction has been assigned a 0 percent rating by analogy under Diagnostic Code 7522, as there is no diagnostic code specifically applicable to erectile dysfunction. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 (allowing for rating of unlisted condition by analogy to closely related disease or injury).

Under Diagnostic Code 7522, a maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for deformity of the penis with loss of erectile power. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522. Where the criteria for a compensable rating under a diagnostic code are not met, and the rating schedule does not provide for a 0 percent rating, a noncompensable (0 percent) rating will be assigned when the required symptomatology is not shown. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Therefore, where both loss of erectile power and deformity are not demonstrated, a 0 percent rating is warranted.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is not warranted at any time during the period under review. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which he reported having erectile dysfunction, but no penile deformity or abnormality. Treatment records do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examination. 

In sum, the record does not show that the Veteran has a deformity of the penis, and his symptoms of erectile dysfunction are contemplated by the award of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ. Accordingly, the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, and a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

10. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension 

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for hypertensive vascular disease with diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. A 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more. A maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating of 10 percent, but not higher, is warranted for hypertension.

VA treatment records show a history of several diastolic pressure readings of 100 or more. For instance, the Veteran's blood pressure was 150/102 in March 2012, 148/100 in May 2017, and 161/102 in September 2019. A September 2022 private treatment record shows that the Veteran's blood pressure was 154/100. It was noted that the Veteran went off his hypertension medication, and his hypertension was uncontrolled at that time. In October 2022, it was noted that the Veteran's blood pressure levels were uncontrolled after he stopped taking Norvasc, and the Veteran was seeking to restart medications for hypertension. By December 2022, it was noted that the Veteran's hypertension was controlled, and the plan was to continue taking hypertension medication. As the record shows a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more with medication required for continuous control, the Board finds that a 10 percent rating is warranted for hypertension. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  

The Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted, as the record does not show diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2023, during which he reported that his hypertension began during service around 2006, at which time he was having nose bleeds. He stated that he continued to have issues with hypertension and reported taking Amlodipine and Terazosin daily. The Veteran's blood pressure readings during the VA examination were 130/78, 128/78, and 130/80. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's hypertension required continuous medication for control, but it did not result any other physical findings or complications. 

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's treatment records from the period on appeal, which contain numerous blood pressure readings. However, the record does not show any readings with a diastolic pressure of 110 or more or systolic pressure of 200 or more. Accordingly, a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted for hypertension. 

The Board has also reviewed and considered a June 2023 written statement from the Veteran's spouse who indicated that the Veteran's blood pressure has gotten progressively worse, despite taking numerous medications over the years. She indicated that the Veteran has headaches, nose bleeds, severe fatigue, chest pains, blurred vision, blood in the urine, kidney problems, high blood sugar, and erectile dysfunction to high blood pressure. 

With respect to the claimed symptoms of chest pains and blurred vision, treatment records show that when the Veteran's blood pressure was noted to be uncontrolled two months before the appeal period in September 2022, the Veteran denied symptoms of headaches, chest pain, blurred vision, and malaise/fatigue. Subsequent treatment records throughout the period on appeal likewise show that the Veteran denied symptoms of chest pain and blurred vision. Accordingly, the Board finds that separate ratings are not warranted for chest pains or blurred vision. 

With respect to fatigue, headache, blood in the urine, and kidney problems, private treatment records show that the Veteran sought treatment for fatigue and hematuria in December 2022, and he was diagnosed with glomerulonephritis and acute kidney failure caused by multiple myeloma. A July 2023 VA examination report shows that the Veteran's multiple myeloma resulted in current symptoms of fatigue, headache, neuropathy in hands and feet, shortness of breath, aching, unsettled stomach, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping. Service connection is in effect for multiple myeloma, for which the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating throughout the period on appeal. Service connection is also in effect for glomerulonephritis, for which the Veteran is in receipt of an 80 percent rating throughout the period on appeal based on renal dysfunction characterized by generalized poor health, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion. Accordingly, the Board finds that separate ratings are not warranted for symptoms of fatigue, headache, blood in the urine, or kidney problems. 

With respect to the claimed nose bleeds, the Veteran reported during the January 2023 VA examination that he was having nose bleeds when he was first diagnosed with hypertension during service. However, treatment records do not show symptoms of nosebleeds due to hypertension during the period on appeal. Accordingly, the Board finds that a separate rating is not warranted for nose bleeds. 

With respect to the claimed high blood sugar, private treatment records during the period on appeal show that the Veteran had hyperglycemia, and his blood sugar was in the prediabetes range. However, hyperglycemia and prediabetes essentially refer to a laboratory findings of blood sugar that is higher than normal, but not high enough to be called diabetes. see https://medlineplus.gov/hyperglycemia (defining hyperglycemia); https://medlineplus.gov/prediabetes (defining prediabetes). Laboratory findings are not, in and of themselves, a "disability" for which compensation is payable. See, e.g. 61 Fed. Reg. 20,440, 20,445 (May 7, 1996). The term "disability," for VA compensation purposes, refers to impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018); Allen, 7 Vet. App. at 448. The record does not show that the Veteran's elevated blood sugar, in and of itself, diminished the Veteran's earning capacity in any way. Moreover, there is no competent evidence of record indicating that the Veteran's elevated blood sugar is a manifestation of his hypertension. Accordingly, the Board finds that a separate rating is not warranted for high blood sugar. 

Finally, with respect to erectile dysfunction, service connection is already in effect for erectile dysfunction, and the Veteran is receiving SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ for his erectile dysfunction. 

In sum, the Veteran's hypertension has been manifested by a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more requiring continuous medication for control; however, the record does not show diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more, or any other complications of hypertension that have not already been separately compensated. As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against assigning a rating higher than that already assigned, a rating higher than 10 percent for hypertension is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

11. Entitlement to a compensable rating for a right elbow scar 

12. Entitlement to a compensable rating for a surgical scar below the right clavicle

Scars not of the head, face, or neck, are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, and 7805.

Under Diagnostic Code 7801, scars not of the head, face, or neck that that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a 10 percent rating for an area of at least 6 square inches (36 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.); a 20 percent rating for an area of at least 12 square inches but less than 72 square inches (465 sq. cm.); a 30 percent rating for an area of at least 72 square inches but less than 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.); and a maximum 40 percent rating for an area of 144 square inches or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801.

Under Diagnostic Code 7802, scars not of the head, face or neck that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a maximum 10 percent rating for an area measuring 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802. 

If there are multiple scars or a single scar affecting multiple zones of the body, a separate rating may be assigned for each affected zone of the body under Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802, Note (2). The six zones of the body are defined as each extremity, anterior trunk, and posterior trunk. The midaxillary line divides the anterior trunk from the posterior trunk. Id. at Note (1). Alternatively, if a higher evaluation would result from adding the areas affected from multiple zones of the body, a single evaluation may also be assigned under Diagnostic Codes 7801 and 7802. Id. at Note (2). 

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is assigned for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; a 20 percent rating is assigned for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; and a maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804. An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar. Id. at Note (1). An additional 10 percent        may be added if a scar is both unstable and painful. Id. at Note (2).

Under Diagnostic Code 7805, other disabling effects not considered under Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, and 7804 are rated under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted for either of the Veteran's service-connected scars. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination of his right elbow scar in January 2023, during which the examiner observed one scar near the right elbow where the Veteran had an incision for drainage and intravenous antibiotics administered during service, which measured 2 centimeters by .5 centimeters. The scar was not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar. The scar was not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and did not result in any functional limitation.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination of his surgical scar below the right clavicle in July 2023, during which the examiner observed one scar below the right clavicle resulting from a central line placement for multiple myeloma treatment, which measured 1 centimeter by .5 centimeters. The scar was not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar. The scar was not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and did not result in any functional limitation.

Treatment records during the period on appeal do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examinations. 

In sum, the record does not show scars measuring at least 144 square inches or scars with underlying soft tissue damage measuring at least 6 square inches. Therefore, a compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7801 or 7802. Additionally, the record does not show that either scar is painful or unstable. Therefore, a compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7804. Furthermore, the record does not show disabling effects of the Veteran's scars. Therefore, a compensable rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7805. Accordingly, the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claims, and a compensable rating for a right elbow scar and a surgical scar below the right clavicle is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82. 

13. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for a left knee strain

The Veteran's service-connected left knee disability has been assigned a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5260 based on painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Limitation of motion of the knee is evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 5260 (flexion) and 5261 (extension). Painful joints are entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a 10 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 30 degrees; and a maximum 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260. Full knee flexion is to 140 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a 10 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 10 degrees; a 20 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 15 degrees; a 30 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 20 degrees; a 40 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 30 degrees; and a maximum 50 percent rating is warranted where extension is limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261. Full knee extension is to 0 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Additionally, under Diagnostic Code 5258, a 20 percent rating is warranted for cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5258. Semilunar cartilage is the meniscus lateralis articulationis genus (lateral meniscus) and the meniscus medialis articulationis genus (medial meniscus). DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY, 299 (32nd ed. 2012).  

A separate rating may also be assigned for instability of the knee. See VAOPGCPREC 23-97; 62 Fed. Reg. 63604 (1997) (arthritis of the knee may be assigned separate ratings for limitation of motion and instability, provided that any separate rating is based upon additional disability); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).

Under Diagnostic Code 5257, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation; or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257 (2022). A 20 percent rating is warranted for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace or assistive device for ambulation; or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. Id. A 30 percent rating is warranted for an unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation; or a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or walker. Id.

Note (1) to Diagnostic Code 5257 provides that for patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. Note (2) provides that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). Id.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted for a left knee strain. 

The Board has reviewed and considered the Veteran's assertions in support of his claim, including his reports of left knee pain and limitation of motion, which affect bending, stooping, pushing, pulling, carrying, lifting objects, standing, sitting, walking, climbing stairs, running, and prolonged driving. However, even considering the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms described in DeLuca, there is no evidence of flexion limited to 30 degrees or less such that a higher rating would be warranted based on limitation of flexion, or extension limited to 15 degrees or more such that a higher rating would be warranted based on limitation of extension. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261; see also Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2023, at which time the left knee exhibited flexion to 115 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. After three repetitions, the left knee exhibited flexion to 110 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. The examiner estimated that the left knee would exhibit 105 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension with repeated use over time and 100 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension during flare-ups. There was no evidence of ankylosis. Moreover, a review of the Veteran's treatment records does not show limitation of motion of the left knee that is more severe than noted during the VA examination. Accordingly, a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted based on limitation of motion of at any time during the period under review. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5260, 5261.  

With respect to instability, the January 2023 VA examiner indicated that there was no evidence of recurrent subluxation, persistent instability, or patellar instability. There was no history of a sprain, ligament tear, or surgery, and the Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion. Accordingly, the Board finds that a separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5257.   

The Board has also considered whether a higher or separate rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 5258 (dislocated semilunar cartilage). However, the record does not show that the Veteran has a semilunar cartilage condition with frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion into the join. Accordingly, a higher or separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5258. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5285.

As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against assigning a rating in excess of those already assigned, a rating higher than 10 percent for a left knee strain is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

14. Entitlement to a rating higher than 20 percent for a left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis 

The Rating Schedule distinguishes between the major/dominant extremity and the minor/non-dominant extremity for rating purposes. In this case, the record shows that the Veteran is right-handed. Therefore, the rating criteria relating to the minor/non-dominant extremity apply. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.69. 

Normal ranges of motion of the upper extremity are defined by VA regulations as follows: flexion from 0 to 180 degrees; abduction from 0 to 180 degrees; and internal and external rotation are to 90 degrees. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate I.  Forward flexion is the range of motion from the side of the body out in front, and abduction is the range of motion from the side of the body out to the side. Id.  Lifting the arm to shoulder level is lifting it to 90 degrees. Id.

Under Diagnostic Code 5201, a 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of motion of either arm to shoulder level (90 degrees) and the minor arm to midway between the side and shoulder level (45 degrees). A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the minor arm to 25 degrees from the side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201.  

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 20 percent for left shoulder strain with rotator cuff tendonitis is not warranted.

The Board has reviewed and considered the Veteran's assertions in support of his claim, including her reports of left shoulder pain, which causes difficulty with overhead lifting and prevents him from doing push-ups and pull-ups. However, even considering the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms described in DeLuca, there is no evidence of limitation of motion of the left arm to 25 degrees from the side such that a higher rating would be warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5201; see also Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2023, at which time range of motion testing revealed left shoulder flexion and abduction to 95. There was no additional limitation upon repetition. The examiner estimated that the left shoulder would exhibit 90 degrees of flexion and abduction with repeated use over time and 85 degrees of flexion and abduction during flare-ups. Treatment records do not show limitation of motion of the left arm that is more severe than noted during the VA examination. 

As the record does not show limitation of motion of the left arm to 25 degrees from the side, a rating higher than 20 percent is not warranted based on limitation of motion.   

The Board has also considered whether a higher or separate rating is warranted based on other diagnostic codes relating to the shoulder. However, the record does not show ankylosis of the scapulohumeral articulation; malunion, recurrent dislocation, fibrous union, nonunion, or loss of head of the humerus; or malunion, nonunion, or dislocation of the clavicle or scapula. Accordingly, a higher or separate rating is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 5200, 5202, or 5203. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5200, 5202, 2203. 

15. Entitlement to a rating higher than 20 percent for lumbar spine DDD

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula), a 20 percent rating is assigned where forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees, but not greater than 60 degrees; or where the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or where muscle spasm or guarding is severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. A 40 percent rating is assigned where forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is limited to 30 degrees or less; or where there is favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula.  

Full range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is to 90 degrees of flexion, 30 degrees of extension, 30 degrees of lateral flexion, and 30 degrees of rotation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.

For VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which         the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is   fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted   opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen;       dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment        in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula, Note (5). The criteria for a rating based on ankylosis can also be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 12 (2021).

Associated objective neurologic abnormalities should also be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula, Note (1).

Alternatively, IVDS can be rated based on incapacitating episodes under the IVDS Formula or the General Rating Formula, whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula, Note (6).  

Under the IVDS Formula, a 20 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks, but less than four weeks, during the past 12 months. A 40 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks, but less than six weeks, during the past 12 months. A maximum 60 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

An "incapacitating episode" is defined as a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, IVDS Formula, Note (1). If IVDS is present in more than one spinal segment, provided that the effects in each spinal segment are clearly distinct, each segment is to be evaluated on the basis of incapacitating episodes or under the General Rating Formula, whichever method results in a higher evaluation for that segment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, IVDS Formula, Note (2).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 20 percent is not warranted for a lumbar spine DDD. 

The Board has reviewed and considered the Veteran's assertions in support of his claim, including his reports of back pain, which caused difficulty with bending, stooping, pushing, pulling, carrying and lifting moderate objects, hauling, running, standing, sitting, walking, climbing, squatting, and prolonged driving. However, even considering the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms described in DeLuca, the probative evidence of record does not show forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less, or favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the functional equivalent thereof, such that a higher rating would be warranted under the General Rating Formula. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2023, during which range of motion testing revealed forward flexion to 55 degrees. After three repetitions, flexion was limited to 50 degrees. The examiner estimated that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine would exhibit 45 degrees of flexion with repeated use over time and 40 degrees of flexion during flare-ups. There was no evidence of ankylosis, nor does the examination report note symptoms that would constitute the functional equivalent of ankylosis. Moreover, the Veteran's treatment records do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examination. Accordingly, a rating higher than 20 percent based on limitation of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not warranted at any time during the period under review. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula. 

The Board also finds that a higher rating is not warranted under the IVDS Formula, as the record does not show incapacitating episodes requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician for at least four weeks, but less than six weeks, during the past 12 months. Accordingly, a higher rating is not warranted under the IVDS formula. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, IVDS Formula. 

With respect to associated neurologic abnormalities, the Veteran is in receipt of a separate rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy. The Board acknowledges that "sciatica of the left lower extremity" was noted in the "remarks" section of the January 2023 VA examination report. However, in a May 2023 addendum, the January 2023 VA examiner indicated that the notation  of "sciatica of the left lower extremity" in the "remarks" section of the January 2023 VA examination report was an error that was populated by mistake and should be disregarded. The January 2023 VA examination report shows that although the Veteran reported occasional pain radiating on the left side, he denied symptoms of numbness and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias in the left lower extremity, and a straight leg raising test was negative on the left. The left lower extremity also exhibited full muscle strength and normal reflexes, and the examiner only diagnosed right lower extremity radiculopathy during the examination. Moreover, although the Veteran's treatment records note left lower extremity pain in 2020 and 2021, the record does not show a diagnosis of left lower extremity radiculopathy during the course of the claim, which was filed on December 28, 2022. Accordingly, the Board finds that a separate rating is not warranted for left lower extremity radiculopathy or any other associated neurologic abnormalities during the period under review. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula, Note (1).

As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, a rating higher than 20 percent for a lumbar spine DDD is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

16. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy 

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, a 10 percent rating is assigned for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 40 percent rating is assigned for moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; a 60 percent rating is assigned for severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, with marked muscular atrophy; and a maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, where the foot dangles and drops, and there is no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened, or very rarely, lost. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. 

Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. The Board finds, however, that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning is an appropriate definition. Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (noting, in general, the Board does not evaluate evidence by applying a mechanical formula, but rather conscientiously to the end that its decisions are equitable and just). According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means gentle in nature or temperate. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. The term "moderately severe" includes impairment that is considered more than "moderate" but not to the extent as to be considered "severe."

The term "incomplete paralysis," with this and other peripheral nerve injuries, indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. Id. "Although the note preceding § 4.124a directs the claims adjudicator to award no more than a 20 [percent] disability rating for incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve where the condition is productive of wholly sensory manifestations, it does not logically follow that any claimant who also exhibits non-sensory manifestations must necessarily be rated at a higher level." Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2017).

Additionally, "VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions," and "[a]lthough the Board is not bound by the M21-1, the standards provided in the M21-1 are 'relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims,' which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision."  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 4, 17-18 (2021) (citing Healy v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 321 (2021) and Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018)).

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual provides that "mild" is characterized by disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c.

"Moderate" is the maximum evaluation available for the most significant cases     of sensory-only impairment and is characterized by symptoms described by the claimant and medically graded as significantly disabling and involving a larger area in the nerve distribution. Other sign or symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Id.

"Moderately severe" is characterized by motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. Atrophy may be present; however, marked muscular atrophy falls under the criteria for a severe evaluation. Id.

"Severe" is characterized by motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe long-standing neuropathy cases. For the sciatic nerve, marked muscular atrophy is expected. Although severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than those for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs or symptoms that resemble some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve. Id. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 10 percent is not warranted for right lower extremity radiculopathy at any time.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in January 2023, during which he reported intermittent right lower extremity pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, which was characterized as mild, and a straight leg raising test was positive for pain on the right. A sensory examination was normal throughout the right anterior thigh, thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes. Muscle strength was normal throughout the right lower extremity. Deep tendon reflexes were normal, and there was no evidence of muscle atrophy. Treatment records during the period on appeal do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examination. 

In sum, the record shows that the Veteran's right lower extremity symptoms were wholly sensory, characterized as mild, and the pain was intermittent. Moreover, there was no objective evidence of sensory, reflex, or motor deficits in any part of the right lower extremity upon testing. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy has been manifested by no more than mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Accordingly, a rating higher than 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, and a higher rating right lower extremity radiculopathy is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

17. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD

Under the General Rating Formula for Rating Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula), a 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere  with routine activities, speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, or effectively; impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence; spatial disorientation, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting; and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

A maximum 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational       and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene; disorientation to time and place; memory loss for names of close      relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

The symptoms listed in the General Rating Formula are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or effects thereof, that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the General Rating Formula. Instead, VA must consider all symptoms associated with the Veteran's mental disorder and their effect on the level of occupational and social impairment. Id. When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, VA will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has acknowledged      the "symptom-driven nature" of the General Rating Formula for Rating Mental Disorders and that "a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with      that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The Federal Circuit has explained that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating." Id. at 117.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD is not warranted. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which he endorsed symptoms of depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; and passive suicidal ideation, with no intent or plan. The examiner indicated that the Veteran appeared appropriately dressed and had good eye contact. His though content and process were normal; attention and concentration were intact; speech was normal rate, volume, and tone; and insight and judgment were normal. There was no evidence of psychomotor agitation. With respect to social functioning, the Veteran described his social life as limited to interactions with family and stated that his irritability and emotional distance have caused difficulty in his marriage. He denied having any friends he sees in social settings. With respect to occupational functioning, the Veteran reported being unemployed and last working as a gate guard at a military base in 2020. The examiner characterized the Veteran's level of functioning as occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

Treatment records during the period on appeal do not show symptoms more severe than those noted during the VA examination. In December 2022, the Veteran presented with a depressed affect. In January 2023, he reported occasional sleep disturbance. Otherwise, treatment records during the period on appeal show that the Veteran denied depressed mood, anxiety, high stress levels, sleep problems, memory loss, suicidal thoughts, and hallucinations. It was noted that the Veteran's mood, affect, behavior, judgment, insight, and thought content were normal. 

In sum, the record shows no evidence of gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene; disorientation to time and place; or memory loss for names of close      relatives, own occupation, or own name. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that total occupational and social impairment has not been shown such that a 100 percent rating is warranted. As the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the claim, a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability 

In his December 2022 claim, the Veteran indicated that he was seeking service connection for a right knee strain secondary to his service-connected left knee strain. The Veteran indicated that due to his left knee pain and limitation of motion, he started favoring his right leg, which put significant strain on his hips and right lower extremity, resulting in pain and weakness. He also indicated that his back pain has aggravated his legs.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023, during which he was diagnosed with a right knee strain. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's right knee strain was proximately due to or the result of his left knee strain because they were separate conditions and not medically related, and the medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's claimed leg pain was not proximately due to or the result of his lumbar spine disability because they were separate conditions and not medically related, and the medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship.

The Board finds that a new medical opinion should have been obtained because the examiner did not actually address the Veteran's contention that his right knee strain was caused by having to compensate for left knee pain when weight bearing. Furthermore, proximate cause is no longer required for secondary service connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2023); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). Moreover, the examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's right knee strain was aggravated by his left knee strain and/or lumbar spine DDD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen, 7 Vet. App. at 448-49 (a disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability may be service-connected to the degree that the aggravation is shown). 

Additionally, in a June 2023 written statement, the Veteran's spouse asserted that the Veteran's current joint pain was caused by lifting, running, kneeling, and repelling out of helicopters during his 21 years of service, which put a lot of strain on the Veteran's back, knees, and other joints. Accordingly, the Board finds that a medical opinion also should have been obtained addressing this theory of entitlement. Accordingly, the claim is remanded to correct these duty-to-assist errors. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability

In his December 2022 claim, the Veteran indicated that he was seeking service connection left and right hip disabilities secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine disability. The Veteran also indicated that due to his left knee pain and limitation of motion, he started favoring his right leg, which put significant strain on his hips. 

The Veteran underwent a VA hip examination in July 2023, during which he reported bilateral hip pain that began prior to his separation from service. The Veteran was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of both hips. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's osteoarthritis of the hips was proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability and/or left knee strain because they were separate conditions and not medically related, and the medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship.

The Board finds that a new medical opinion should have been obtained because the examiner did not actually address the Veteran's contentions of having to compensate for left knee pain when weight bearing. Furthermore, proximate cause is no longer required for secondary service connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159; Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1364-65 Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311. Moreover, the examiner did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's arthritis of the hips was aggravated by his left knee strain and/or lumbar spine DDD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen, 7 Vet. App. at 448-49. Accordingly, the claim is remanded to correct these duty-to-assist errors. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

Additionally, in a June 2023 written statement, the Veteran's spouse asserted that the Veteran's current joint pain was caused by lifting, running, kneeling, and repelling out of helicopters during his 21 years of service, which put a lot of strain on the Veteran's back, knees, and other joints. Indeed, during the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran asserted that his bilateral hip pain began during service. Accordingly, the Board finds that a medical opinion also should have been obtained addressing this theory of entitlement. Accordingly, the claim is remanded to correct these duty-to-assist errors. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain another medical opinion with respect to the Veteran's claim for service connection for a right knee disability. Upon review of the record, the examiner should answer the following:

(a.) Is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's right knee strain was incurred in or caused by service, to include as due to strain on the joints from lifting, running, kneeling, and repelling out of helicopters during the Veteran's 21 years of service?

(b.) Is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's right knee strain would not have developed but for, or was worsened or prevented from improving by increased strain placed on the right lower extremity due to compensating for pain from his service-connected left knee strain and/or lumbar spine DDD?

The examiner should provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation for all opinions. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.

2. Obtain another medical opinion with respect to the Veteran's claim for service connection for left and right hip disabilities. Upon review of the record, the examiner should answer the following:

(a.) Is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's osteoarthritis of the hips was incurred in or caused by service, to include as due to strain on the joints from lifting, running, kneeling, and repelling out of helicopters during the Veteran's 21 years of service?

(b.) Is at least as likely as not (likelihood is in approximate balance, if not higher) that the Veteran's osteoarthritis of the hips would not have developed but for, or was worsened or prevented from improving by increased strain placed on the lower extremities due to compensating for pain from his service-connected left knee strain and/or lumbar spine DDD?

The examiner should provide a detailed rationale and complete medical explanation for all opinions. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why.
