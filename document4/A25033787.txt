Entitlement to service connection for morbid obesity is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Obesity is not a disability for VA compensation purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for morbid obesity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1985 to March 1992.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2023 decision.  In February 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board recognizes that in his VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated disagreement with the September 2023 rating decision. However, because he had already filed a VA Form 20-0996 (HLR) as to that rating decision for the issue of service connection for morbid obesity, the VA Form 10182 challenging that rating decision for that issue would constitute concurrent election. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). Accordingly, the Board will construe the Veteran's VA Form 10182 as disagreeing with the February 2024 HLR rating decision, and proceed with adjudication.

Service connection for morbid obesity.

The Veteran has contended that service connection was warranted for morbid obesity on the basis that while he was on active duty in the Marine Corps, he began to experience weight gain and he "continue[s] to currently experience and have been diagnosed with morbid obesity." See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Service connection on a direct basis requires (1) competent and credible evidence confirming the Veteran has the claimed disability or at least has since filing the claim; (2) competent and credible evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or injury; and (3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus or link between the in-service injury or disease and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Obesity is not among those conditions contemplated as disabilities in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Further, VA's Office of General Counsel held in a 2017 precedential opinion that obesity is not a disability or disease subject to service connection on a direct or secondary basis. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017).

Generally, the Board is bound by the General Counsel's opinion as Chief Legal Officer of the Department. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c); see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 429 (1994) ("By statute, the Board is bound to follow the precedent opinions of the VA General Counsel"); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 305 (2020) ("As an initial matter, we note that G.C. precedent opinions are issued by VA's chief legal officer and are binding on the Board.").

In the 2017 opinion, VA's Office of General Counsel held that obesity is not a disability or disease subject to service connection on a direct or secondary basis. The General Counsel considered the definition of a disability subject to service connection under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131 and looked to the disability rating schedule for guidance, noting that 38 U.S.C. § 1155 requires the Secretary to "adopt and apply a schedule of ratings of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries" which must be "based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations." The General Counsel considered whether obesity results in impairment. Although there are more than 700 conditions in the rating schedule, the schedule does not include obesity as a disability. Rather, as noted in the General Counsel opinion, obesity is only part of the criterion for a 30 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7907 for Cushing's syndrome, which further indicates that morbid obesity is a sign or symptom of another disability rather than a disability in and of itself. The General Counsel opinion instructs that although morbid obesity may be considered in certain cases as an intermediate step in secondary service connection, obesity itself is not considered a disease or disability for which direct or secondary service connection may be granted. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017 (Jan. 6, 2017). 

While it is possible that an otherwise binding General Counsel's opinion could be superseded by case law or statute, the Board finds no such inconsistent authority. While mindful of the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018), and the Federal Circuit's discussion in Larson v. McDonough, 10 F.4th 1325 (2021), and finds that these later decisions are not inconsistent with the 2017 General Counsel opinion finding that obesity is not a disability subject to service connection.

In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1363, the Federal Circuit held that the term disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability" in the context of a claim for service connection for a knee condition. In making this determination, the Federal Circuit noted the Secretary's acknowledgements that the rating schedule associated the concept of disability with impairment in earning capacity and that VA regulations invoke functional limitation as the indicator of reduced earning capacity and the barometer of disability. Id. at 1362. The Federal Circuit explained that the purpose of veterans' compensation was to compensate for impairment to a veteran's earning capacity. Id. at 1363. 

The Federal Circuit also found, in Saunders, that "the Veterans Court erred as a matter of law in holding that pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis or identifiable condition, cannot constitute a 'disability' under § 1110, because pain in the absence of a presently diagnosed condition can cause functional impairment." Id. at 1368. In holding that pain causing functional impairment of earning capacity may constitute a disability subject to service connection, the Federal Circuit discussed VA's treatment of pain in other rating and service connection contexts and definitions of impairment. The Federal Circuit noted that VA's disability rating regulations treat pain as a form of functional impairment when assessing disability, which was relevant to the question of whether pain can be a disability. Id. at 1364. The Federal Circuit also noted that 38 U.S.C. § 1117 "specifically recognizes pain as a form of functional loss, specifying that '[m]uscle pain' and '[j]oint pain' can be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness and therefore can constitute a disability even in the absence of a diagnosis." Id. at 1365. The Federal Circuit noted the "broad recognition that pain is a form of functional impairment." Id. at 1365.

The 2017 General Counsel opinion finding that morbid obesity is not a disability subject to service connection is not inconsistent with Saunders. Rather, in determining whether obesity could be considered a disability, the General Counsel similarly looked to the treatment of obesity in VA's disability rating regulations and considered whether obesity results in functional impairment of earning capacity. 

Unlike Saunders, which involved joint pain and 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 contemplating painful motion as productive of disability in terms of rating disabilities, there is no provision in the disability rating criteria for obesity as a standalone impairment. Rather, obesity is not listed in the rating schedule as a disability and does not have consideration for compensation by itself. As explained in the 2017 General Counsel opinion, the only mention of obesity in the rating schedule is as part of the criterion for a 30 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7907, for Cushing's syndrome, which further indicates that obesity is one sign of another disability rather than a disability in and of itself. Moreover, obesity does not result in a rating for Cushing's syndrome by itself, but is rather one of five factors required for a compensable rating. Unlike joint pain, obesity is not contemplated by the rating schedule as a compensable condition. In the 2017 opinion, the General Counsel considered both the omission of obesity from the rating schedule's list of disabilities (despite the fact that "obesity is a well-known and widespread condition") and the treatment of obesity as merely one symptom of many required for a compensable rating for a distinct disease (Cushing's syndrome) in determining that obesity itself is not a disease or disability for service connection purposes. 

In addition, unlike in Saunders, where there was "broad recognition that pain is a form of functional impairment," the General Counsel opinion notes that the only identifiable sign of obesity is its defining characteristic, an excess accumulation of fat in the body as determined by height and weight, which is not necessarily an impairment. The General Counsel explained that morbid obesity is generally described as an excess accumulation of body fat, merely a statistic derived from dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. As noted in the General Counsel opinion, while used as a screening tool in conjunction with other tools such as blood pressure to assess a person's risk for other diseases, as for harm caused by obesity itself, research has not yet found a true causal connection between morbid obesity and morbidity and/or mortality. The General Counsel noted that impairment is not inevitable or even usual in most individuals who meet the criteria for obesity according to medical research, and that many people have no impairment from obesity. After consideration of the medical evidence and the legal guidance, the General Counsel explained that "obesity, per se, does not impair earning capacity." Essentially, there was no functional impairment of earning capacity from the obesity itself. In that regard, the Board finds the General Counsel's opinion to be wholly consistent with the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders. Cf. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1363.

In Larson v. McDonough, 10 F.4th 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit held that the Board's determination of what constitutes a disability for purposes of 38 U.S.C. § 1110 is subject to judicial review because it involves statutory interpretation. The Federal Circuit noted that the question before the court was "narrow" - only whether a Board decision concerning what constitutes a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 necessarily implicates the content of the rating schedule and therefore triggers 38 U.S.C. § 7252(b)'s restriction on the Veteran Court's jurisdiction. Id. at 1328. Under 38 U.S.C. § 7252(b), the "Court may not review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section 1155 of this title or any action of the Secretary in adopting or revising that schedule." In Larson, the Federal Circuit held that the prohibition in 38 U.S.C. § 7252(b) includes direct challenges to the content of the rating schedule. By contrast, reviewing a determination by the Board that a claimed condition does not constitute a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 leaves the rating schedule undisturbed. Id. at 1329. The Federal Circuit noted that it specifically held that the Veterans Court can review what constitutes a disability in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, and that Saunders articulated a definition of "disability" for 38 U.S.C. § 1110 purposes that is distinct from disabilities listed on the rating schedule. Id. at 1329. The Federal Circuit noted that this case involved a claim for service connection under § 1110 and did not seek to invalidate or revise any portion of the rating schedule. Id. at 1329. Accordingly, the Federal Circuit found that Saunders controlled the outcome of the appeal in that the determination that morbid obesity was not a disability under § 1110 was subject to judicial review.

However, in Larson, the Federal Circuit did not make any specific findings regarding whether morbid obesity is a disability subject to service connection under 38 U.S.C. § 1110, nor provide any specific findings regarding what constitutes a disability subject to service connection beyond those laid out in Saunders. Instead, the Federal Circuit merely held that the Board's reasons or bases as to whether a condition constitutes a "disability" at all for purposes of service connection is subject to judicial review (rather than part of the prohibition of judicial review of the rating schedule under 38 U.S.C. § 7252(b)).

The Board finds no conflict in the reasoning employed in the 2017 General Counsel's opinion and the Federal Circuit's holding in Larson. The Federal Circuit in that case merely held the Board's interpretation of what constitutes a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 is subject to judicial review but did not invalidate or otherwise contradict the 2017 General Counsel's opinion that obesity is not a disability within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 1110. As such, the Board finds no basis not to similarly be bound by the precedential opinion here.

In sum, the Board is bound by the 2017 General Counsel's opinion that obesity is not a disability subject to service connection. The subsequent Federal Circuit decisions have been considered, but the Board finds no conflict between those holdings and the General Counsel opinion. Rather, the finding that obesity is not a disability subject to service connection is supported by review of the rating schedule and consideration of whether obesity results in functional impairment of earning capacity. Unlike the knee pain contemplated by Saunders, which was noted to generally have been recognized to result in functional impairment of earning capacity, the Board finds that obesity does not constitute a disability under 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131 as it does not result in functional impairment of earning capacity. Accordingly, as obesity is not a "disability" subject to service connection, the Veteran's claim for service connection for morbid obesity must be denied.
