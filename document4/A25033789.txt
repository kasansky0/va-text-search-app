ORDER

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the remaining amount of $20,884.62 is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Recovery of the overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the remaining amount of $20,884.62 is against equity and good conscience.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for waiver of recovery of an overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the remaining amount of $20,884.62, have been met and a waiver is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1987 to July 1990 and from February 1991 to May 1991.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 decision of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (Committee) at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which waived recovery of $1,501.14 of a $22,385.76 debt and denied waiver of the remainder, $20,884.62.  In its decision, the Committee indicated that the Veteran did not timely request a waiver of recovery of the initial $20,884.62 debt, but did timely request a waiver of the $1,501.14 debt.  Nonetheless, the decision considers the merits of the elements of equity and good conscience.  

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), on which she identified the January 2024 decision and elected the Direct Review Docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Waiver

A September 2020 rating decision granted entitlement to VA compensation benefits.  In a September 2020 letter, the RO notified the Veteran of the decision as well as things which would affect his right to payment.  This included advising the Veteran that his payments would be reduced if he was incarcerated in a federal, state, or local penal institution for more than 60 days for conviction of a felony.  He was advised that he was required to notify VA immediately of a change in any condition affecting his right to continued payments, to include incarceration.  

In a February 2021 letter, the RO again advised the Veteran that his payments would be reduced if he was incarcerated in a federal, state, or local penal institution for more than 60 days for conviction of a felony, and that he was required to notify VA immediately of a change in any condition affecting his right to continued payments, to include incarceration.  

Under pertinent VA law and regulation, any individual who is entitled to compensation or to dependency and indemnity compensation and who is incarcerated in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility for a period in excess of sixty days for conviction of a felony (where, as here, committed after October 7, 1980) shall not be paid such compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation, for the period beginning on the sixty-first day of such incarceration and ending on the day such incarceration ends, in an amount that exceeds (A) in the case of a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 20 percent or more, the rate of compensation payable under section 1114(a) of this title; or (B) in the case of a veteran with a service-connected disability not rated at 20 percent or more or in the case of a surviving spouse, parent, or child, one-half of the rate of compensation payable under section 1114(a) of this title.  38 U.S.C. § 5313(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(a).  

In March 2022, VA received information via a computer match indicating that the Veteran had been confined at a penal institution in July 2021.  Thereafter, also in March 2022, the RO attempted to confirm this information with the penal institution.  In April 2022, the penal institution replied and indicated that the Veteran was confined in that institution following a July 26, 2021, conviction and had been transferred to another penal institution on October 18, 2001, with a prospective maximum release date in July 2023.

The RO subsequently sent notice to the Veteran in April 2022 advising him that VA had received evidence which indicated that he had been incarcerated following conviction of a felony at a penal institution on July 26, 2021.  He was told that VA law, specifically 38 U.S.C. § 5313, required that the payment of VA compensation benefits be reduced to the lesser of the two following amounts after the 61st day of incarceration following conviction of a felony: a. the amount payable for a disability evaluated as 10 percent disabling if the combined disability evaluation is 20 percent or more, or; b. the amount equal to one-half of the rate payable for a disability evaluated as 10 percent disabling if the combined evaluation is 10 percent.  The RO proposed to reduce the Veteran's benefits effective September 25, 2021.  The Veteran was duly advised of his due process rights, including the right to submit additional evidence and request a hearing.  He was advised that he would be continued to be paid at the current rate for 60 days while his case was reviewed.  He was told that in the event the RO implemented the proposed reduction, overpayment of benefits would result which was subject to repayment.   

In June 2022, the RO notified the Veteran that it had reduced his compensation benefits as proposed.  The RO explained that it had reduced his benefits as proposed, effective September 25, 2021, the 61st day of his incarceration at a penal institution following his felony conviction.  He was provided the substance of the VA law and regulation.  He was advised that his full benefits may be resumed upon release from incarceration effective from the date of release, parole, transfer to transitional housing or half-way house, only if VA receives notice within one year of release, otherwise VA may not pay from any date prior to the month the notice is received from an official source.  A table of the exact calculation of amounts payable was provided to the Veteran.

In July 2022, the Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of the amount he owed due to the reduction in his benefits which was $20,884.62.  The letter stated that the Veteran could request a waiver of the recovery of the debt in certain circumstances.  The record contains a copy of that letter which does not notify the Veteran of the time limit for requesting a waiver.  The letter, however, advised the Veteran to "Please see the back of this letter for more information" regarding disputing the validity of the debt or requesting a waiver.     

The Board notes that under applicable criteria, a request for waiver of an indebtedness shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness to the debtor.  The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrates, as a result of error by either the VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, that there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing.  If the debtor does substantiate there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the 180-day period shall be computed from the date of the debtor's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness.  38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b)(2).

On the reverse side of the July 2022 letter, the Veteran may have been informed that he had 180 days to request a waiver of the recovery of this debt.  However, a copy of that information is not of record.  For this reason, the Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds there is insufficient information upon which to find that the Veteran received complete notice of the debt at issue as a result of VA error.  Thus, his request for a waiver, as indicated below, is accepted as timely.  38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b)(2).

In February 2023, the penal institution advised VA that the Veteran would be released on July 11, 2023.  On July 14, 2023, the Veteran requested that his VA compensation benefits be resumed in full.  The RO then requested official notification from the penal institution.  

In July 2023, the penal institution responded that the Veteran's date of confinement following conviction had been July 11, 2021, and that his scheduled release date was July 11, 2023.  

In a September 2023 letter, the RO advised the Veteran that his benefits were resumed in full effective  July 11, 2023.  The Veteran was also notified that in light of the new information regarding his initial incarceration date, the RO proposed to reduce his benefits to the 10 percent rate effective September 10, 2021 as the 61st date following confinement after the conviction.  The Veteran was duly advised of his due process rights, including the right to submit additional evidence and request a hearing but did not respond within 60 days.  

In a November 2023 letter, the RO advised the Veteran that it had taken the proposed action and reduced his compensation to the 10 percent rate effective September 10, 2021 (it was previously noted to be September 25, 2021).  The RO reiterated relevant VA law and regulation.  VA then restored the Veteran to full VA compensation benefits effective July 11, 2023 due to his release.  This action resulted in an increase in the debt.  The DMC notified the Veteran in November 2023 that the increase totaled $1,501.14.  

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a financial status report and requested a waiver of the recovery of the overall debt.  The Veteran indicated that his monthly income from VA benefits and Social Security income totaled $2,110.  He had no other source of income.  His monthly expenses totaled $1,945, consisting of $375 for rent or mortgage, $400 for food, $380 for utilities and heat, $390 for auto insurance, gas, clothes, and cleaning supplies, and $400 in monthly payments on installment debts.  He had about $135 in cash and a car for assets.  The Veteran reported no car payment.  He had no listed debts to creditors but for the $400 installment debt within his monthly debt amount.  He indicated that he lives a very modest life.  

In its decision, the Committee found no fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the Veteran.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding, absent clear and unmistakable evidence.  In cases where fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the Veteran's part with respect to the creation of the overpayment at issue has not been demonstrated, and, therefore, waiver is not precluded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a), the Board must determine whether recovery of the indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience, thereby permitting waiver under 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a).  In making this determination, consideration is given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) fault of debtor (where actions of the debtors contribute to the creation of the debt); (2) balancing of faults (weighing fault of the debtor vs. the fault of VA); (3) undue hardship (whether collection would deprive the debtor or family of basic necessities); (4) defeat the purpose (whether withholding of benefits or recovery would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended); (5) unjust enrichment (failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the debtor); and (6) changing position to one's detriment (reliance on VA benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right or incurrence of a legal obligation).  See 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a). 

As to the principles of equity and good conscience part of the Board's analysis, the record shows the Veteran was at fault in the creation of the debt in failing to timely report his incarceration. VA was required to reduce his benefits to the 10 percent rate from the 61st date of incarceration and did so in a timely fashion upon learning of his incarceration.  Thus, VA bears no fault in the creation of this debt.  

The Board further finds that the Veteran's receipt of additional full funds from VA that he was not lawfully entitled to because he was incarcerated results in unfair enrichment to him.   

As to whether collection of the debt would defeat the purpose of paying the benefits by nullifying the objective for which the benefits were intended, the Board notes that the Committee found that there is hardship because the level of monthly income basically approximates the level of monthly debt, and the Veteran has minimal assets.  There is no clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary.  The Board therefore accepts this favorable finding.  

Having balanced the factors enumerated above, the Board finds that a waiver is warranted in this case.  There is significant financial hardship with regard to repayment and this element of equity and good conscience is being afforded the most weight.  Accordingly, a waiver of the recovery of the debt is warranted.
