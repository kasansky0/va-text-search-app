ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for migraines is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, his migraines began in active service and have continued since that time. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for migraines have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2013 to April 2018.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by the VA Regional Office (RO). 

In the September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that on the September 2023 VA Form 10182, in addition to migraines, the Veteran stated that he was appealing the disability evaluation for posttraumatic stress disorder. However, the Veteran had already appealed that issue to the Board in October 2022, and so it is not before the Board at this time.

Entitlement to service connection for migraines is granted.

The Veteran contends that he experiences migraine headaches which began and have continued since active service. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his migraines are due to his service-connected tinnitus.

Certain chronic diseases (to include migraines as an organic disease of the nervous system) may be presumed to be service connected if manifested as chronic in service, or to a compensable degree within a specified period of time following separation from service (one year for organic disease of the nervous system). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). Alternatively, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) the existence of a chronic disease in service or during an applicable presumption period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 and (ii) present manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) when a chronic disease is not present during service, evidence of continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran was afforded a VA opinion in October 2022. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's migraines were not aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus and that there was not sufficient medical evidence to support a determination of a baseline level of severity for the migraine disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2022. The Va examiner determined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus causes the migraine disability. The Veteran reported to the examiner that his headaches started in 2017 after a fall. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2021 during which he reported that his headaches began after falling down a ladder well in 2016. The VA examiner determined that there was no nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his migraine disability. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2018 during which he reported that his headaches began in 2017.

In a March 2018 dental health questionnaire completed while in service, the Veteran indicated that he experienced migraine headaches.

Here, the Veteran is competent to report the nature and duration of his headache symptoms as he has personal knowledge, derived from his own senses, of what is being attested; "[c]ompetent testimony is thus limited to that which the witness has actually observed, and is within the realm of his personal knowledge." Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994). Although medical evidence is generally necessary for a nexus to service, lay evidence can be sufficient to show continuity of symptoms after service, as a foundation for a nexus opinion, or to link chronic in-service symptoms to the same diagnosed current disability, or as a substitute for a nexus. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Board finds the Veteran's statements that his headaches began during active service and continue to this day to be credible and assigns them probative value.

In making this decision, the Board has considered the negative evidence of record, including the negative nexus opinions of the VA examiners. However, no VA examiner rendered an opinion as to direct service connection nor did any of the examiners address the indication of migraine headaches that appear in service treatment records. After careful consideration of the evidence of record, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection are met. The medical evidence shows a diagnosis of migraines. Furthermore, the Veteran has reported a history of headaches that began in active service and continue to this day. The Veteran is competent to report any history of observable symptoms, and, in this case, the Board finds no reason to doubt the veracity of the Veteran's reported history. As there is a diagnosis of migraines (a chronic disease enumerated under 38 U.S.C. § 1101) and credible, competent evidence of continuity of symptomatology, the current migraine disability is considered to have been incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.309(a).
