ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus onset during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2003 to September 2004.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board; however, the Board's decision is considered a full grant of the matter on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts that his tinnitus had onset during active service. 

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including tinnitus, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Tinnitus is a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. YT v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 195, 196 (1996). Tinnitus is the type of disability that is capable of lay observation. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  

In this case, the Veteran had a high probability of exposure to hazardous noise during service and has consistently reported that his tinnitus began during active service. While a July 2024 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion, they did not refute these findings. The Board has no reason to doubt the Veteran's reports of experiencing tinnitus during service and presently and finds these statements credible. 

As tinnitus, a chronic disease, was present during service and is present currently, and is not clearly attributable to an intercurrent cause, service connection is granted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a); see also Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.
