ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran's representative that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of service connection for depression by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Navy from December 1964 to December 1966.

In the December 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing Review docket.

Service connection for depression. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).

In the present case, the Board received written notification from the Veteran's representative on March 14, 2025, expressing the Veteran's desire to withdraw his appeal. The writing contained the Veteran's name, VA file number, and was signed by the representative.

Thus, there is no allegation of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal; it is dismissed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
