ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran suffered bilateral plantar fasciitis in the line of duty. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2002 to September 2007 and from May 2009 to May 2010, including service in Southwest Asia.  As a result of the Veteran's military service, he received the Combat Action Badge, among other decorations. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the September VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307.  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, a veteran is presumed to be in sound condition, except for defects, infirmities or disorders noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  Such conditions are considered to be pre-existing.  

When a pre-existing disorder is noted on entry, a veteran has the burden of showing that it is at least as likely as not that the disorder increased in severity during service.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).  If a veteran meets that burden and shows that an increase in severity occurred, the burden then shifts to VA to show whether such increase is clearly and unmistakably due to the natural progression of the pre-existing disability rather than due to service.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 235 (2012); C.F.R. § 3.306(a).  Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and following service.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

The Veteran contends that he began to have problems with his feet in 2004 during his first period of active duty due to mounting and dismounting vehicles in Iraq.  See Statement in Support of Claim, August 2010. 

Service treatment records document normal arches during the Veteran's January 2002 enlistment examination.  See Medical Treatment Record- Government Facility, March 2014.  However, service records document a line of duty determination that stated the Veteran had bilateral plantar fasciitis that occurred during operation Iraqi Freedom in the line of duty.  See Military Personnel Record, January 2009.  There is also record of plantar fasciitis due to running which was determined to be in the line of duty in May 2009.  See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility, December 2010.

A fellow soldier recounted witnessing the Veteran limping due to his foot problems while deployed in Iraq.  The soldier recalled seeing the Veteran report to sick call numerous times due to painful fee.  See VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, December 2010.

During the Veteran's reserve service in May 2012, the Veteran was put on a profile due to his chronic and recurrent plantar fasciitis which was determined to be in the line of duty.

In March 2013, the Veteran underwent a VA examination.  The examiner stated that the Veteran's left plantar fasciitis, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to May 2009, was exacerbated by his second period of active duty most likely due to prolonged standing and excessive running or exercise.  However, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's condition was not permanently aggravated by his service.  This examination is afforded little probative value as the Board does not find that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis preexisted service.  This examiner did not consider that the Veteran had a period of service from 2002 to 2007 and only considered the Veteran's period of service from 2009 to 2010.  See VA Examination, March 2013.

In December 2023 a second VA opinion was obtained.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis is at least as likely as not due to his service as his service records indicate that he suffered from plantar fasciitis in service.  See C&P Exam, December 2023.

The evidence clearly demonstrates that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis is due to his military service.  The Veteran had a lengthy period of service on active duty and in the National Guard.  There is a clear determination that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was incurred in the line of duty, and this determination was bolstered by the December 2023 VA examiner.  The evidence clearly establishes that the Veteran injured his feet in the line of duty, and that his symptoms have continued to the present.  Service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis is warranted.
