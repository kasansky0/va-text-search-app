ORDER

The appellant is eligible to direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision for service connection for asthma with sleep apnea; to this extent, the appeal is granted.

The appellant is not eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the on the past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria met and basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status being established; to this extent, the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's October 2022 appointment of the appellant as his attorney, and the associated fee agreement, are valid.

2. In a January 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for asthma with sleep apnea with an evaluation of 30 percent from October 19, 2022, and an evaluation of 100 percent effective November 7, 2023, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested.  In that same decision, the AOJ found SMC based on housebound criteria met from November 7, 2023; and basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status established from November 7, 2023. 

3. The January 2024 rating decision was not the initial decision on the issue of service connection for sleep apnea.  

4. The January 2024 rating decision was the initial decision on the issue of SMC based on housebound criteria met and basic eligibility to DEA being established, and not the result of any appeal of a prior decision. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the January 2024 award of service connection for asthma with sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

2. The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the January 2024 award of SMC based on housebound criteria met and basic eligibility to DEA being established being established, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1997 to July 2001. 

The appellant, Robert J. Levine, is the Veteran's current attorney. 

The case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Summary of the Case (fee decision) and constitutes an initial decision on the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 fee decision on appeal, and a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the NOD if received within 30 days of the notice of the content of the NOD. 38?C.F.R. §§?20.400-20.405.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  

The record reflects both the Veteran and appellant were mailed copies of the AMA Initial and Final Notification Letters dated February 2024 and April 2024. 

Issue: Whether the appellant is eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision.

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

In Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit) held that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision has been under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (b), and thereby invalidating the regulatory provision of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i). 7 F.4th 1110, 1135-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Federal Circuit explained that while § 5104C(b) supplemental claims may have a different effective date and duty to notify than § 5104C(a) supplemental claims, see §§ 5110(a)(3), 5103(a)(3), such distinctions should matter in the context of charging attorneys' fees. Id. at 1139.  The Court expressly rejected the government's argument that a § 5104C(b) supplemental claim filed more than a year after a prior decision is not part of the same "case" as that earlier decision, thereby barring attorneys from charging fees for any work on such claims until the supplemental claim itself is rejected. Id. at 1138.

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

Analysis

In October 2022, the Veteran and the appellant executed a VA Form 21-22a and fee agreement, which provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of any past due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the 20 percent was to be paid directly to the appellant by VA.  The Board finds that the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney, and the associated fee agreement, are valid. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).

In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ denied, among others, denied service connection for sleep apnea.  

In December 2023, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim and an Addendum that requested review of the December 2022 rating decision which denied service connection for sleep apnea. See VA Form 20-0995 and Addendum received December 2023.  

In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for asthma with sleep apnea with an evaluation of 30 percent from October 19, 2022, and an evaluation of 100 percent effective November 7, 2023; granted SMC based on housebound criteria met from November 7, 2023; and found basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status established from November 7, 2023, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested. 

In a January 2024 Summary of the Case (fee decision on appeal), the AOJ denied eligibility to attorney fees, based on the past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision: reasoning that VA never received a qualifying request to review the rating decision.

Here, the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney, and the associated fee agreement, are valid.  Accordingly, this case turns on whether the appellant is eligible to receive fees stemming from the December 2023 supplemental claim seeking, in pertinent part, service connection for sleep apnea. 

By January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for asthma with sleep apnea.  The Board notes the Veteran's disability is evaluated under Diagnostic Code 6602-6847, applicable to bronchial asthma and sleep apnea syndromes (obstructive, central, mixed). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6602-6847.  Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The Board finds it appropriate that in granting service connection the AOJ recharacterized the issue on appeal as a claim for entitlement to service connection for asthma with sleep apnea.  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that when a veteran claims service connection, he is not claiming service connection for a specific diagnosis but for his symptoms regardless of the diagnosis, and the claim encompasses the underlying condition, regardless of diagnosis.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  

To that end, the Board finds the appellant is eligible to fees based on the January 2024 rating decision award of service connection for asthma with sleep apnea.  The previous December 2022 rating decision was the initial decision on the issue.  A December 2023 supplemental claim was submitted pertaining to service connection for sleep apnea.  Thus, the appellant filed a qualifying review of a prior decision pertaining to the issue of sleep apnea, now service-connected as asthma with sleep apnea, and representation took place after issuance of notice of an initial decision, which essentially resulted in the subsequent grant issued in the January 2024 rating decision.  An attorney may charge fees for representation provided after the initial decision on an issue.  Accordingly, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 2024 rating decision and the appeal is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636. 

However, the appellant is not eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees on the award of SMC based on housebound criteria met and basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status, as the January 2024 rating decision is the initial decision on the issues and not the result of any appeal of a prior decision.  The issues had not previously been denied and the January 2024 rating decision was the initial decision as to entitlement to DEA and SMC housebound.  Furthermore, there was no pending increased rating on appeal.  An attorney may not charge fees for representation provided before the initial decision on an issue. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).  The issuance of this initial decision triggered the beginning of the period for which the appellant may receive?fees?for work performed under the?Fee?Agreement.  But the decision itself does not warrant the direct payment of fees to the appellant.  Meaning, under the AMA, attorney?fees?are only warranted for valid representation taking place after the issuance of notice of an initial decision.  

In sum, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the January 2024 award of service connection for asthma with sleep apnea; to this extent, the appeal is granted.  

However, the appellant is not eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the January 2024 award of SMC based on housebound criteria met and basic eligibility to DEA being established; to this extent, the appeal is denied
