ORDER

The character of the appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of VA benefits, to include Chapter 17 VA healthcare benefits; the appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The appellant's misconduct in service, which included repeated periods of misconduct, was willful and persistent. 

2.  The appellant's June 1992 special court-martial sentence of a bad conduct discharge was affirmed and executed.

3.  The evidence does not show compelling circumstances mitigated the appellant's acts of misconduct.   There has been no removal of the bar to VA benefits via an upgrade to the appellant's character of discharge; nor is there evidence showing that the appellant was insane at the time of his offenses.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The character of the appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of VA benefits, to include Chapter 17 VA healthcare benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5303, 1700 et seq.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.12, 3.360.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served on active duty from November 1990 to March 1994; the character of his discharge is the subject of this appeal.   

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 Higher Level Review decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that reviewed a November 2023 administrative decision that found the appellant's discharge from service is dishonorable for VA purposes. 

In the appellant's December 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Notice of Disagreement (NOD), he elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.   

The Board highlights, if evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims in the present appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.   

CHARACTER OF DISCHARGE CLAIM

The appellant, in sum, asserts that his DD-214 is incorrect and that he did not receive a bad conduct discharge.  See e.g., VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim, June 2023; VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, November 2023; HLR - Informal Conference, December 2023; VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, December 2023.  He alleges that he received a general under honorable conditions discharge due to medical conditions. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board disagrees with the appellant in this case.   

1. The character of the appellant's discharge from service

At the outset, the Board highlights that the service department findings (i.e., the Army, Navy, and Air Force) are binding and conclusive upon VA for purposes of establishing an individual's service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12.

In other words, VA does not have authority to alter the findings of the service department.  38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a); Spencer v. West, 13. Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000); Venturella v. Gober, 11 Vet. App. 240, 241 (1997); Cahall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 232, 237 (1994); Duro v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 530, 532 (1992).  

In this claim, the service department characterized the appellant's discharge as a bad conduct discharge.  See DD-214.

Accordingly, the VA has no authority to alter the claimant's discharge classification, as he, in essence, is requesting in this claim.  The claimant's recourse is with the service department.  Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416 (1994).

The appellant essentially seeks "veteran" status for VA purposes for his period of service.   

In this regard, the Board highlights recent amendments updating the regulation governing character of discharge claims, and applying to all cases pending before VA.  See Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,361 (April 26, 2024) (codified at 38?C.F.R. §3.12) (effective June 25, 2024).   

Importantly, if a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the appellant will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.   

In this case, the Board will consider the appellant's claim under the old criteria prior to the June 25, 2024 effective date of the amendment and under both the old and new rating criteria from June 25, 2024.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied, as permitted by law.   

Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand to provide the appellant with notice of the change in the regulation is not required.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided).   

VA benefits are not payable unless the period of service upon which the claim is based was terminated by discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable.  38 U.S.C. § 5303; 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a). 

A discharge or release because of willful and persistent misconduct is considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions.  38?C.F.R. §?3.12(d)(4) (2023); 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(d)(2)(ii) (effective June 25, 2024).  Willful misconduct means an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n).  An act is willful misconduct where it involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or a wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.  Id.  A discharge because of a minor offense will not be considered willful and persistent misconduct if service was otherwise honest, faithful, and meritorious.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(4) (2023).  However, an offense that interferes with or precludes the performance of military duties cannot be characterized as a minor offense.  See Stringham v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 445, 448 (1995). 

Turning to the evidence, the appellant enlisted in the United States Army on November 06, 1990; for a period of four years on active duty.   

During active service, the appellant was charged and sentenced by Summary Court Martial after conviction of multiple violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in July 1991, which included violations of Article 86 (failure to report to his appointed place of duty) in April 1991 and three counts of violation of Article 134 (making/uttering worthless checks by dishonorably failing to maintain funds) in February 1991 and March 1991.  He was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to forfeiture of $500 pay per month for one month and confinement for 30 days.  

The appellant's duty status reports (DA Form 4187) show that he entered confinement on July 3, 1991 and was released on July 29, 1991.

Following the above, the appellant was next charged and sentenced by Special Court Martial convened at Heilbronn, Germany after being convicted of multiple violations of the UCMJ in June 1992, which included violations of Article 128 (assault consummated by battery) on or about August 8, 1991 and Article 134 (indecent assault) on or about October 17, 1991.  He was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to a bad conduct discharge and confinement for four months.    

The appellant's duty status reports (DA Form 4187) show that he entered confinement on January 29, 1992 and was released on May 7, 1992.

Following his four-month confinement due to conviction and sentencing by Special Court Martial on January 29, 1992, the appellant was released from active duty on May 7, 1992, and placed on voluntary excess leave "for the good of the service" for an indefinite period pending final appellate review of his punitive discharge.

On January 28, 1994, the sentence to bad conduct discharge and confinement for four months, adjudged on January 29,1992, as promulgated in Special Court Martial Order Number 13, dated June 10, 1992, was affirmed and the bad conduct discharge executed.

The appellant was then discharged from active military service on March 11, 1994, while on voluntary excess leave, with a bad conduct discharge, due to reasons listed as: Court Martial, Other.    

On review of the record, the Board finds the Appellant's offenses during service constitute willful and persistent misconduct.  

First, the appellant was charged with UCMJ violations in February 1991, March 1991, April 1991, August 1991 and October 1991.  In this regard, the Board finds the appellant's misconduct that led to his discharge was persistent.  

Next, the Board finds that the record reflects deliberate and intentional wrongdoing resulting in serious disruption of performing his duties during service, to include failing to appoint to his appointed place of duty, writing and cashing dishonorable checks, assault and battery, as well as "indecent" assault, leading to his confinement on two separate occasions during service.  

In this regard, while the appellant challenges the character of his discharge, there is no indication that his actual misconduct that led to his discharge did not involve deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or a wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.  In fact, at a minimum, the appellant received initial training on the UCMJ and consequences of his violations during service.  There is no indication at the Court Martial proceedings that he did not understand the nature and consequences of his misconduct.

Finally, the Board notes that the appellant's misconduct leading to his discharge, assault consummated by battery and indecent assault, were not minor offenses, such that the appellant faced a maximum punishment of bad conduct discharge and confinement for six months for the former and dishonorable discharge and confinement for seven years for the latter.  

Taken together the Board finds the appellant's offenses were not minor offenses under the UCMJ.

Here, the Board highlights that any offense interfering with or precluding the performance of military duties cannot be characterized as a minor offense.  See Stringham v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?445, 448 (1995); Cropper v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?450 (1991).   For example, being absent without official leave (AWOL) has been found to constitute willful and persistent misconduct rather than a minor offense.  See e.g., Struck v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?145 (1996); Stringham v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?445, 445 (1995) (four AWOL violations and a failure to obey a lawful order was willful and persistent misconduct); Winter v. Principi, 4?Vet. App.?29, 32 (1993).   

Additionally, under the amended regulation, "minor misconduct" is defined as misconduct for which the maximum sentence imposable pursuant to the Manual for Courts-Martial United States would not include a dishonorable discharge or confinement for longer than one year if tried by general court-martial, which is not the case here.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(d)(2)(ii) (June 25, 2024).  

Moreover, the appellant's in-service misconduct did not consist of a mere minor offense offset by otherwise honest, faithful, and meritorious service of benefit to the Nation.   See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(4) (2023).  As noted, his misconduct is not considered minor and this provision does not apply in this case.

Furthermore, the appellant does not argue nor does the evidence show any reason or compelling circumstances that mitigated the appellant's acts of misconduct.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(e).  This includes the appellant's post-service arguments in his current claim.

The Board has considered the appellant's positive character witness statements that he has submitted in this claim.  However, even if the Board were to consider the appellant's work performance outside of his periods of misconduct as "honorable and faithful" or otherwise at or above average for the entire period, to include his service while in confinement where he received a "letter of good conduct" from an instructor, his so-called "good" behavior at work (and while in confinement for misconduct) does not negate or outweigh the seriousness of the crimes or the lengthy and otherwise serious pattern of misconduct with which the appellant conducted himself during the entirety of his service.  

Considering all the above, the Board does not find the appellant's service, exclusive of the misconduct, can be characterized as meritorious, and of benefit to the Nation.   38?C.F.R. §?3.12(e)(1).

The appellant does not give any reasons for the misconduct and the record does not raise any compelling circumstances to warrant mitigation of the misconduct during service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.12(e)(2).

Finally, considering factors under 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(e)(3), there is no evidence that a valid legal defense would have precluded conviction under the UCMJ.  First, the appellant accepted nonjudicial punishment and had not raised any issues with his legal proceedings or with legal counsel that he elected not to consult with in service.  Second, the appellant acknowledged that he engaged in willful misconduct during service.  Third, the appellant has submitted no evidence that such a valid defense exists to preclude conviction for his multiple offenses.   

As such, based on the analysis of this record in particular, the Board finds the appellant's willful and persistent misconduct is not mitigated by compelling circumstances under 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(e).   

Importantly, the appellant does not argue and there is no evidence showing that the appellant was insane at the time of his offenses.   See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(b); see also Zang v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?246, 254 (1995) (such a determination is not warranted when the record does not reflect a Veteran suffered from insanity due to disease or that he or she did not know or understand the nature or consequences of his or her acts, or that what he or she was doing was wrong); Stringham v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?445, 449 (1995) (the burden is on the appellant to submit competent medical evidence that the Veteran was insane at the time of the offenses).

Lastly, as noted above, there has been no removal of the bar to VA benefits via an upgrade to the appellant's bad conduct discharge by the service department.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(f).

Based on these findings, the Board concludes that the appellant's in-service misconduct that led to his discharge was willful and persistent, and therefore his bad conduct discharge is a bar to the receipt of VA benefits.

Finally, regarding healthcare benefits under Chapter 17 of title 38 U.S.C. for disabilities incurred or aggravated in service.  Here, the Board notes healthcare benefits are not afforded to servicemembers who are subject to a bar to benefits under section 3.12(c) or to servicemembers whose service was terminated by a bad conduct discharge.  38 C.F.R. § 3.360(b).  In this case, the appellant's discharge is listed as due to a bad conduct discharge.  This finding is the service department's characterization of the appellant's service, and it is final and binding on VA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a), (f).  Therefore, the appellant is not eligible for healthcare benefits under Chapter 17 for disabilities incurred in service and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Newman v. McDonough, 35?Vet. App.?310 (2022).
