ORDER

The appeal seeking a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), to include on an extraschedular basis, prior to May 3, 2013, is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

For the period prior to May 3, 2013, the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

For the period prior to May 3, 2013, the criteria for a TDIU were not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.340, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1979 to June 1986 and from January 1991 to June 1991.

In July 2023, the Board issued a decision under the Legacy Appeals System that remanded the claim of entitlement to a TDIU.  In March 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to a TDIU from May 3, 2013, and issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) as to entitlement to a TDIU prior to May 3, 2013.  The SSOC advised the Veteran of his appeal rights, including the option to opt-in to the modernized appeal system (i.e., Appeals Modernization Act (AMA)) within 60 days from the date of notification of that SSOC.  

In response the Veteran timely elected to opt-in to the modernized review system, when he submitted the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a TDIU prior to May 3, 2013.

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1).  A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned on the basis of individual unemployability when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  In such an instance, if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.

The Board must evaluate whether there are circumstances in the Veteran's case, apart from any non-service-connected conditions and advancing age, which would justify a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.19; see Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993); see also Hodges v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 375 (1993); Blackburn v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 395 (1993).  The Veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Prior to May 3, 2013, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities were as follows: right ankle injury (rated at 20 percent), neck disorder (rated at 20 percent), back disorder (rated at 10 percent), left ankle disorder (rated at 10 percent), right knee disorder (rated at 10 percent), and loss of teeth (rated at 0 percent).  Therefore, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more with a combined rating of 70 percent or more, and, therefore, he did not meet the requisite disability ratings to qualify for TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Even though the Veteran did not meet the schedular criteria for consideration of a TDIU for the period prior to May 3, 2013, the Board must still consider whether referral for extraschedular consideration under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) is warranted.  Under the extraschedular provision of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), a Veteran must show that he is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities in order to warrant a referral to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration.

After a thorough review of the record and after considering the effects of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, the Board finds that referral for consideration of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis is not warranted for the period prior to May 3, 2013.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

In that regard, in the Veteran's May 2012 TDIU application, he indicated that he was currently working and earning about $1,800 per month.  In April 2014, the Veteran submitted a new TDIU application, indicating that he became too disabled to work on November 18, 2013, he last worked full time on May 2, 2013, and he worked 40 hours a week in a warehouse from November 2010 to May 2, 2013.  

The claims file also shows that in April 2020, the AOJ attempted to obtain employment information from the warehouse where the Veteran had last worked.  VA made follow-up requests for a VA Form 21-4192, Request for Employment Information, to the former employer in May 2020 and June 2020.  In June 2020, VA advised the Veteran of its unsuccessful attempts to obtain employment information from his former employer.  That same month, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, to advise that his former workplace went out of business in May 2013.  

The Veteran identified the same place of employment in his May 2012 and April 2014 TDIU applications without identifying any other places of employment. Moreover, he indicated he was employed until May 2, 2013.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his service-connected disabilities prior to May 3, 2013.  As indicated, despite the limitations caused by his service-connected disabilities, the record reflects the Veteran was able to continue working full time at a warehouse and stopped working on May 2, 2013.  Furthermore, it is not shown, and the Veteran has not contended, that his work was performed in a protected environment.  See LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111 (2024).  Accordingly, the Board finds that, for the period prior to May 3, 2013, entitlement to a TDIU, to include on an extraschedular basis, is not warranted.
