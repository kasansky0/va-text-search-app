DOCKET NO. 241011-481135
DATE: April 11, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for ureterolithiasis (also claimed as nephrocalcinosis) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for elevated creatine is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active-duty military service from April 1985 to January 2007. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in April 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for ureterolithiasis and entitlement to service connection for elevated creatine, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the one-year time limit for requesting a docket switch expires in less than one month. Because the following issues are being remanded to the AOJ, the Board discerns no prejudice to the Veteran by issuing a decision at this time. 

1-2. Entitlement to service connection for ureterolithiasis (also claimed as nephrocalcinosis) elevated creatine is remanded.

The Veteran is asserting that his diagnosed ureterolithiasis and elevated creatine is related to his service-connected kidney stone disability. See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

With his August 2023 claim form the Veteran submitted medical evidence that showed both ureterolithiasis and elevated creatine. April 2024 VA medical opinions both indicate that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's claimed ureterolithiasis and elevated creatine disorders are related to the service-connected kidney stones. The opinions cite "no pathology to warrant a diagnosis".

The Board finds that the April 2024 negative VA opinions did not consider the August 2023 medical evidence and contradict the August 2023 medical evidence without attempting to reconcile the divergent findings. The Board finds the April 2024 opinions inadequate. 

Unlike in the legacy system, the reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors); and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). 

Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to reconcile the divergent diagnostic evidence from the August 2023 private medical records and the April 2024 VA medical opinion and so that the examiner may expressly consider the August 2023 private medical evidence.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's ureterolithiasis and elevated creatine disorders are at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected kidney stones.

Please cite the August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, the August 2023 DBQ submitted by the Veteran, the April 2024 VA examination reports with medical opinions, and this decision.

Please remind the examiner to reconcile the positive diagnostic findings in the August 2023 private DBQ versus the negative diagnostic findings from the April 2024 VA examination report and opinion.
