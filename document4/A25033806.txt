FINDINGS OF FACT

The Veteran died in December 2024, while the current appeal was pending.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1950 to January 1952. 

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from May 2024 and June 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the May 2024 decision, the RO denied service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus. In the June 2024 decision, the RO granted service connection and an initial 10 percent rating for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder, effective August 7, 2023. On Higher-Level Review of the latter decision in July 2024, the RO increased the rating for other specified trauma and stressor related disorder to 30 percent, effective August 7, 2023. Thereafter, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in November 2024, selecting the hearing review option. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

Dismissal

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in December 2024, while the current appeal was pending. As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

There are, however, provisions in place to allow an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision. This process is called substitution. The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b). To file a request for substitution, you may use VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant," which can be found online here:

https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-0847-ARE.pdf.

The completed form may be submitted electronically via ACCESSVA. The web address for ACCESSVA is https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=dmhs.

Alternatively, you may mail the completed form to:

Department of Veterans Affairs

You may also submit the form directly to your nearest VA Regional Office. To find a VA Regional Office nearest you go to:

Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution. A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title . . .." 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a). There is a helpful factsheet that explains who is eligible for accrued benefits here:
