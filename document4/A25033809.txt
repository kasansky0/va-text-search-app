CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of whether the reduction from a 20 percent rating to a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's back disorder was proper have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1990 to October 1996. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in March 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

As noted, in the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and selected a Telehearing. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The issue of whether the reduction from a 20 percent rating to a 10 percent rating for the Veteran's back disorder was proper.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202, A Notice of Disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary. Per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f), if a Notice of Disagreement is unclear as to the issues being appealed or which review option the Veteran selects, the Board will contact the Veteran to request clarification of the Veteran's intent. Further, a claimant must respond to the request either within 60 days of the request for clarification or within one year of the notice of the adverse action otherwise the "the previous communication from the claimant will not be considered a Notice of Disagreement as to any claim for which clarification was requested. The Board will not consider the claimant to have appealed the decision(s) on any claim(s) as to which clarification was requested and not received." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g).

As noted, in March 2022, the AOJ decreased the Veteran's rating for his back disorder from 20 percent to 10 percent. 

On March 31, 2022, VA received the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran indicated he was electing the Direct Review lane to appeal the issue of the rating reduction for his back disorder and also indicated he requested a Virtual Telehearing. By letter dated April 7, 2022, the Veteran was informed he could only submit one review option and a new Notice of Disagreement was required. On April 16, 2022, the Veteran filed another Notice of Disagreement, again selecting the Direct Review Docket and Virtual Telehearing.

By letter dated January 23, 2025, the Veteran was again informed he could only select one review option, and a new Notice of Disagreement was required. The letter further indicated if a new Notice of Disagreement was not received, the Veteran's appeal would be dismissed. A new Notice of Disagreement was not received within 60 days of the January 2025 letter.

?

A proper Notice of Disagreement is required. If a claimant fails to respond to VA's request for clarification, the Board will not consider the claimant to have appealed the decision on any claim as to which clarification was requested. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(g). As such, the matter is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
