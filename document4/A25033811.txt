ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain results in plantar flexion of 5 degrees and dorsiflexion of 5 degrees during flare ups. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from October 1976 to August 1983. 

This case is being reviewed according to the appellate process set forth under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. The AMA or modernized review system applies to all claims, requests for reopening of finally adjudicated claims, and requests for revision based on clear and unmistakable error for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019, the effective date of the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following a decision issued in January 2022 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which granted entitlement to a 20 percent rating for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain effective from November 5, 2021. 

The Veteran initiated his claim in the Legacy system on November 6, 2013 seeking a compensable rating for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain. A September 2014 rating decision increased his evaluation to 10 percent effective November 6, 2013. 

The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in December 2014, and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in January 2017. The Veteran filed a VA Form 9 in February 2017 and requested a Board hearing. In March 2017, a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) was issued, and the Board remanded the claim so the Veteran could be afforded a hearing. 

In May 2018, the Veteran opted-into the AMA via the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) and chose the Supplemental Claim review option. A RAMP decision was issued in October 2018 which continued the 10 percent rating for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain. 

The Veteran then sought additional review under RAMP in January 2019 and requested a Board hearing. A Board hearing was held in February 2021 and a transcript is included with the file.

The Board remanded the issue in July 2021 for additional development and in January 2022 the RO granted entitlement to a 20 percent rating for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain effective from November 5, 2021. 

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2022 decision. In January 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior January 2022 decision. The HLR decision granted an effective date of November 6, 2013, for the 20 percent evaluation for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in May 2023 and elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Law and Analysis

Disability evaluations (ratings) are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the entire record to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing for pain "on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Left Ankle

The Veteran seeks a rating in excess of 20 percent for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain. The Veteran's disability is evaluated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5271 which addresses limited motion of the ankle. 

The Board acknowledges the rating criteria for the musculoskeletal system was amended effective February 7, 2021. When a regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, including a change in rating criteria, the version most favorable to a veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). The Veteran's avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain is rated under DC 5271. Prior to the amendment, a 10 percent rating was afforded to disabilities with moderate symptoms and a 20 percent rating was afforded to disabilities with marked symptoms. The terms "moderate" and "marked" are not defined. The amended rating criteria maintained the same evaluations for marked and moderate disabilities and provided additional criteria to define such terms. As the evaluations for marked and moderate remain the same, the Board finds there is no prejudice to the Veteran in applying the amended criteria.

Under DC 5271, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for a moderate disability consisting of less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a marked disability consisting of less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.

The Board notes the Veteran's disability is currently assigned the highest possible evaluation defined by the rating schedule during the entire appeal period. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2014 where he reported left ankle tenderness and itching that has remained consistent with the use of a steroid patch. The Veteran's left ankle range of motion measured 15 degrees of plantar flexion and 10 degrees of dorsiflexion each with painful motion. Following repetitive use, the Veteran's plantar flexion and dorsiflexion measurements were the same. He reported flare ups characterized by swelling and tenderness. The examiner noted symptoms of incoordination and impaired ability to execute skilled moves smoothly, painful motion, and swelling of the left ankle. The Veteran had regular strength testing and no ankylosis. He reported regular use of a cane to support walking. 

The Board acknowledges the July 2021 Board decision found the August 2014 examination was insufficient for adjudication as the examiner did not comply with the requirements of Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168 (2016). The Board nevertheless finds the examination provides some insight into the Veteran's overall disability picture during the period on appeal and affords the August 2014 examination some probative weight. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2021 where he reported his disability has worsened and requires the use of an assistive device and the prescription corticosteroid triamcinolone. The Veteran reported daily flare ups lasting one to two hours characterized by light jogging or prolonged standing and walking. Initial range of motion testing showed plantar flexion of 20 degrees and dorsiflexion of 10 degrees with pain on motion. The examiner also indicated pain on weight bearing and active and passive motion. Following repetitive use, the Veteran's range of motion was 15 degrees of plantar flexion and 10 degrees of dorsiflexion. Repeated use over time was estimated at 10 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of dorsiflexion. Finally, the Veteran's estimated range of motion during a flare up was noted to be 5 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of dorsiflexion. The examiner indicated there is no muscle atrophy or ankylosis. The Veteran reported regular use of a brace to support his left ankle. 

The Board affords great probative weight to the November 2021 VA examination as the examiner conducted objective testing to evaluate all signs and symptoms which indicate the severity of the Veteran's disability. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2009).

Here, the Board finds the Veteran is entitled to a 20 percent rating for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain noting his range of motion during flare ups measures 5 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of dorsiflexion which is contemplated by the 20 percent criteria. The Board notes a 20 percent rating is the highest afforded by the rating criteria of DC 5271.

The Board acknowledges that it may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). Here, VA Medical Center (VAMC) treatment records indicate the Veteran was provided triamcinolone to ameliorate a skin irritation. See May 2021 VAMC treatment record. During the February 2021 Board hearing, the Veteran reported the use of steroid cream to alleviate itching of the left ankle and consideration of a Supplemental Claim for an associated skin disability. The Board therefore finds the provisions of Jones do not apply as the medication does not address symptoms associated with the Veteran's musculoskeletal left ankle disability. 

The Board has considered whether referral for an extraschedular rating is appropriate. The determination of whether a claimant is entitled to an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b) is a three-step inquiry. The threshold factor for extraschedular consideration is a finding that the evidence before VA presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate. Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008) (citing Fisher v. Principi, 4 Vet. App. 57, 60 (1993), and Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88, 95 (1996)). Therefore, initially, there must be a comparison between the level of severity and symptomatology of the claimant's service-connected disability with the established criteria found in the rating schedule for that disability...[I]f the criteria reasonably describe the claimant's disability level and symptomatology, then the claimant's disability picture is contemplated by the rating schedule, the assigned schedular evaluation is, therefore, adequate, and no referral is required. Thun, 4 Vet. App at 115.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence does not show such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluation for the Veteran's avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain is inadequate. The Veteran's symptoms are contemplated by the schedular criteria including the functional loss of plantar flexion and dorsiflexion ranges of motion resulting from pain during flare ups. See also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.40, 4.71a. As such, the available schedular criteria for the Veteran's service-connected avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain is adequate, and referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim seeking a rating in excess of 20 percent for avulsion fracture of left ankle, status post left ankle sprain is denied.
