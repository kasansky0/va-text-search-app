ORDER

The appeal for a request of a waiver of indebtedness in the amount of $824.85, for monthly housing allowance benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill), is REMANDED.  

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 2013 to April 2017. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decision addressing an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  

In the December 2022 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA For 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).    

REASONS FOR REMAND

In his December 2022 VA Form 10182, the Veteran challenges an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits.  The Veteran lists an October 13, 2022, decision as the one on appeal.  This decision is not in evidence; the last document associated with the education appeal file is dated July 1, 2022.  

VA received an enrollment certification (VA Form 22-1999) on September 16, 2020, for the Veteran's enrollment at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University - Worldwide Online for the school term running from September 9, 2020 through November 10, 2020, for 3 distance credit hours.  On October 13, 2020, the school notified the AOJ via a Notice of Change in Student Status (VA Form 22-1999b) that the Veteran had been withdrawn by the institution with punitive grades effective October 13, 2020, and the reasons listed as unsatisfactory attendance.  

The record includes letters from VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) issued in April and August 2022, for an overpayment of Chapter 33 benefits in the amount of $824.85.  The record also contains an October 20, 2022, "Decision on Comprise Case" denying a comprise offer seemingly made by the Veteran in the amount of $120.00.   

An overpayment debt is created when VA determines that a beneficiary or payee has received monetary benefits to which he was not entitled. 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.911, 1.962.  In order for the Board to determine that the overpayment was not properly created, such that the debt was not valid, it must be established that the appellant was legally entitled to the benefits in question or, if the appellant was not legally entitled, then it must be shown that VA was solely responsible for the appellant being erroneously paid benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 21.9695(b) (providing that an overpayment of educational assistance paid to an eligible individual constitutes a liability of that individual unless the overpayment results from an administrative error or an error in judgment).   

38 C.F.R. § 21.9725 provides that in order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory progress, conduct, and attendance.  VA will discontinue educational assistance if the individual does not maintain satisfactory attendance.  

Although the present appeal appears to stem from the school's notification of the Veteran's withdrawal due to unsatisfactory progress for the term from September 9, 2020 through November 10, 2020, the record does not contain evidence showing that the Veteran was properly notified of the overpayment, to include explanation of the statutory or regulatory provisions considered to deem the overpayment properly created, and the payment history and accounting relied on by the AOJ to calculate the amount of the overpayment.  

The record does not contain evidence showing that the Veteran requested a waiver of indebtedness and, if so, whether he was provided with an opportunity to submit a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655).  Additionally, while the record contains a "Decision on Comprise Case," there is no evidence showing the terms of the Veteran's offer, to include the date of such offer and the reasons or supporting arguments, if any.  The educational file associated with this appeal contains documents dated only until July 1, 2022.

The Board made all efforts to obtain from the AOJ the outstanding procedural and appellate documents that should be associated with this appeal to no avail.  As of the date of this Remand Decision, no additional evidence has been received in connection with this claim.  Under the governing procedural rules, the "Board may remand for correction of any . . . error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."  The Board finds it is so here and that curing the failure to provide proper notice to the Veteran, a regulatory duty, has a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim.  A remand is proper.  38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).   ?

For the reasons set forth above, the Board finds that the claim should be remanded for proper notice to be provided to the Veteran and for the missing evidence to be made part of the record to cure the AOJ's error.   

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Conduct the search necessary to secure the following documents: 

(a)	 The initial notification of overpayment resulting from the Veteran's withdrawal from the school term from September to November 2020; 

(b)	The payment history for the enrollment period in question and the accounting relied on by the AOJ to calculate the amount of the overpayment; and

(c)	The Veteran's request for a waiver of indebtedness, or compromise offer, to include any accompanying documents (i.e., Financial Status Report or VA Form 5655) or arguments, if applicable. 

Efforts to obtain this evidence may include requesting a copy of these from the Veteran if not found in the Veteran's educational file.  Thereafter, add a copy of each of these documents to the educational claims file and provide proper notice to the Veteran of the same.
