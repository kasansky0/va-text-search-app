FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board decision, the Veteran withdrew the appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1995 to January 1999.

The case is on appeal from a January 2021 rating decision.

In the September 2021 notice of disagreement (NOD) on appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, in a February 2025 statement, the Veteran requested that all pending Board appeals be withdrawn.  Thus, the hearing request is considered withdrawn.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e).

A rating in excess of 50 percent for migraine headaches including migraine variants.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  An appeal may be withdrawn by the claimant or representative at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In a February 2025 correspondence, the Veteran stated that he wants to withdraw all pending appeals before the Board.  He explained that he has been granted 100 percent service connection and no longer wishes to pursue the appeals.

The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal of the appeal is "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant."  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011); see also Acree v O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  In this regard, the Veteran stated, in writing, that he wants to withdraw all pending BVA appeals.  In addition, he explained that he has been granted 100 percent service connection.

Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration with regard to this appeal.  Accordingly, the issue on appeal is dismissed.
