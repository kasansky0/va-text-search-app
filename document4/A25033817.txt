ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 100 percent from April 10, 2017 for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 19, 2010, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to a service-connected disability prior to March 9, 2021 is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 9, 2021 for the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 10, 2017 for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for PTSD for the entire review period currently on appeal.

2. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) first received a claim of service connection for a psychological disorder on August 19, 2010. In February 2011, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying service connection for PTSD. However, new and material evidence was received within one year of the decision. The AOJ never adjudicated whether such evidence was new and material in subsequent decisions. Thus, the claim is not final.

3. The Veteran has had psychological symptoms since at least 2005.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 100 percent from April 10, 2017 for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code (Code) 9411 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of August 19, 2010, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110 (2018, 2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155 (2014, 2018, 2024), 3.156, 3.160, 3.400 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2003 to April 2004, as well as an additional period of active duty for training from June 1980 to September 1980.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2022 rating decision by VA.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of March 2021 and August 2021 decisions. In March 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2021 and August 2021 decisions, as applicable.

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, for the issues related to a TDIU and PTSD, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. For the issues related to SMC at the housebound rate and DEA benefits, the Board may only consider the evidence at the time of the August 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, as applicable, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. However, for the remanded issues herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those issues. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that, at one point, there were two simultaneous claims for an increased rating for PTSD, and thus, there are two simultaneous requests for a TDIU that could be pending before the Board. The earlier claim for an increased rating for PTSD stemmed from the April 10, 2017 claim of service connection, as the Veteran continuously pursued the rating assigned after service connection was granted in an April 2020 rating decision. As pertinent to this discussion, the request for an increased rating for PTSD was denied in a March 2021 rating decision, and the Veteran sought HLR of that decision in February 2022, as discussed above. The AOJ then issued the March 2022 HLR rating decision on appeal. A TDIU has been raised by the record and has attached to the earlier claim for an increased rating for PTSD, pending since April 10, 2017. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

While the earlier claim for an increased rating for PTSD was being continuously pursued, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating and a TDIU on March 9, 2021, see VA Form 21-8940, which was adjudicated by the AOJ in the August 2021 rating decision referenced above. In February 2022, the Veteran sought HLR of that decision, which the AOJ adjudicated in the March 2022 rating decision on appeal.

The request for a TDIU as attached to the earlier pending claim for an increased rating for PTSD is not moot because the Veteran has not been awarded SMC at the housebound rate prior to March 9, 2021. Thus, the TDIU matter before the Board stems from the April 10, 2017 claim for service connection for PTSD and the evidentiary record is limited to the March 2021 rating decision. The Board notes, however, that the matter is limited to whether a TDIU is warranted based on a single service-connected disability, as entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate is the only possible benefit due to the Veteran being in receipt of a 100 percent rating for PTSD during the review period. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008). The Board will adjudicate the matter accordingly.

The matter of entitlement to a TDIU stemming from the March 9, 2021 VA Form 21-8940 is moot because the Veteran is in receipt of a total disability rating and SMC at the housebound rate from the date of that claim. Thus, that matter will not be adjudicated herein.

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 100 percent from April 10, 2017 for PTSD.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

The maximum rating allowed for PTSD pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders is 100 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Code 9411. 

The review period before the Board in the current matter begins on April 10, 2017. The Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating during the entire review period. Because the Veteran may not be assigned a rating in excess of 100 percent, this matter must be denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 10, 2017 for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

The Veteran asserted that an effective date of August 19, 2010 is warranted because an examiner found that the Veteran's psychological disorder was "tethered" to his time in combat and combat experiences. See December 2022 Notice of Disagreement.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

From March 24, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018); 79 Fed. Reg. 57,696 (Sept. 25, 2014).

For decisions issued prior to February 19, 2019, a final claim is one in which the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). A claimant must file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that notice of the determination is mailed to him or her. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. A decision will not become final if new and material evidence is submitted within one year of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

"New" evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decision-makers. "Material" evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), VA must evaluate submissions received during the relevant period and determine whether they contain new evidence relevant to a pending claim. Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2011). A pending claim is not finalized until VA makes the required § 3.156(b) determination. Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014). However, VA does not need to include specific words to fulfill the requirements of § 3.156(b). There may be an implicit finding so long as there is some indication that VA determined whether the submission is new and material evidence and, if so, considered such evidence in evaluating the pending claim. Pickett v. McDonough, 64 F.4th 1342, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Date of Claim

VA first received a claim of service connection for a psychological disorder on August 19, 2010. See VA Form 21-526b. In a February 2011 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for PTSD on the basis that the evidence was insufficient to confirm a link between current symptoms and an in-service stressor. The decision was issued later that month. The Veteran did not appeal the decision. 

New and material evidence was received within one year of the February 2011 rating decision. Specifically, in a September 2011 VA treatment record, the Veteran's treating licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) stated that the Veteran "related episodes while in the military that are most frequently associated with PTSD and he expressed symptoms most frequently associated with that diagnosis." This evidence is new because it post-dates the February 2011 rating decision and it is material because it relates to whether there is a confirmed link between the Veteran's current symptoms and an in-service stressor. Because new and material evidence was received within one year, the claim did not become final.

In December 2011, the Veteran filed a new claim of service connection for a psychological disorder. See VA Form 21-526b. The AOJ denied service connection for PTSD in a March 2013 rating decision, issued later that month. Significantly, the March 2013 rating decision did not list any recently received VA treatment records as part of the evidence considered. As such, the Board finds that the AOJ did not make a determination as to whether the September 2011 VA treatment record was new and material evidence. The Veteran did not appeal the March 2013 rating decision. 

New and material evidence was received within one year of the March 2013 rating decision. Specifically, an October 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's mood disorder, not otherwise specified, was at least as likely as not related to his fear of hostile military or terrorist activity. This evidence is new because it post-dates the March 2013 rating decision. It is also material because it relates to whether there is a confirmed link between the Veteran's current symptoms and an in-service stressor. As a result, the March 2013 rating decision did not become final. 

In September 2013, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a mood disorder. See VA Form 21-526EZ. In December 2014, the AOJ denied service connection for anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified, and depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. The decision was issued later that month. The AOJ discussed that the Veteran had previously claimed service connection for PTSD, but it was addressing "mood disorder separately from PTSD." In light of the AOJ's statement that it was considering this decision as separate from his prior claim, the Board finds that it did not determine whether new and material evidence had been received within one year of the February 2011 and March 2013 rating decisions.

After the December 2014 rating decision was issued, the next claim of service connection for a psychological disorder was received on April 10, 2017, the currently assigned effective date. See VA Form 21-526EZ. Because the prior claim of service connection remained pending ever since the August 19, 2010 claim, the appropriate date of claim for this matter is August 19, 2010.

Date of Entitlement

The Veteran reported that he had psychological symptoms since 2005. See, e.g., January 2011 VA examination. The record supports his assertion. See April 2005 VA treatment records (reflecting anxiety and depression). Thus, the date of entitlement for this matter is no later than 2005.

Here, the date of claim is later than the date of entitlement. As a result, an effective date of August 19, 2010, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to March 9, 2021 on the basis of a single service-connected disability.

As discussed above, because the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for PTSD during the review period for this matter, entitlement to a TDIU is not moot only to the extent that it can be the basis of a 100 percent rating for a disability other than PTSD, such that SMC at the housebound rate may be awarded. Prior to March 9, 2021, the Veteran is service connected for the following other disabilities: a back disability, tinnitus, and a hearing loss disability.

The Board finds that there is a reasonable possibility that the Veteran's service-connected back disability alone prevents him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful occupation. Currently, the Veteran does not meet the schedular requirements to be entitled to a TDIU based on his back disability alone. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Thus, the Board will refer the matter to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration of a TDIU based solely on the Veteran's back disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

The record reflects that the Veteran receives Social Security Administration (SSA) disability benefits. See October 2013 VA PTSD examination. Because the Veteran's SSA records may reasonably contain information relating to the issue on appeal, remand is required to obtain his SSA records. See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 9, 2021 for the grant of SMC at the housebound rate; entitlement to an effective date prior to April 10, 2017 for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits.

These issues are inextricably intertwined with the other remanded issue; accordingly, they must be remanded as well.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ should request directly from the SSA relevant records, including determinations and medical records, regarding any claim for disability benefits.

2. The AOJ should refer this case to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration of a TDIU based solely on the Veteran's back disability prior to March 9, 2021 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).
