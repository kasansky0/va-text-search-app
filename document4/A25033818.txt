DOCKET NO. 210519-160448
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the March 2021 rating decision, which proposed severance of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability, is dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

On March 17, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, submitted a written statement on March 17, 2025, withdrawing his appeal of the March 2021 rating decision that proposed severance of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability.  The March 17, 2025 written statement includes the Veteran's name and file number and explicitly states the Veteran's intent to withdraw his entire appeal, satisfying the requirements for a written withdrawal of the appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  Thus, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
