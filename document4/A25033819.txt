REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army National Guard with several periods of Federal active duty service, most recently from May 2020 to December 2020. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 (bilateral pes planus), February 2024 (bilateral pes planus), and March 2024 (bilateral knees, lumbar spine, psychiatric) rating decisions of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In March 2024, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket when he submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), appealing the above issues. Under the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. No additional evidence was added to the record with the NOD.

The Veteran listed additional issues, i.e. service connection for a right shoulder condition, migraine headaches, tenia pedis, and use of a creative organ, in his March 2024 NOD. However, he had previously appealed these issues in an earlier and separate February 2024 NOD, and so are addressed in the separate Board decision following the February 2024 NOD. Concurrent elections are prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

A claim for a finding of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is not inferred as part of the claims for increased rating, as the Veteran continued to work full-time and had not asserted that he is unable to work due to his service-connected disabilities during the period on review. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

With respect to the claims decided herein, VA has met all statutory and regulatory notice and duty-to-assist provisions. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5100, 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5106, 5107, 5126; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326. Neither the Veteran nor his representative has advanced any procedural arguments in relation to VA's duty to notify and assist. Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

Effective Dates

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have argued as to a specific earlier effective date for any condition. In general, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

If a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an intent to file a claim, the date of claim for effective date purpose is the date the intent to file was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). With regard to supplemental claims, when a claim has been continuously pursued, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

In connection with claims for increased rating, an effective date up to one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim for increase is possible, when the worsening is factually ascertainable during that period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

While the Veteran had previously submitted an intent to file for compensation on November 15, 2015, he did not submit a formal application for benefits within the year. This intent to file therefore expired. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6). On January 3, 2022, the Veteran submitted another intent to file for compensation. He then timely submitted a Fully Developed Claim (VA 21-526EZ) for service connection for a psychiatric condition on November 10, 2022. Prior to these filings, there were no formal or informal claims of record for service connection for any condition. Therefore, the Board finds that the appropriate date for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric condition is January 3, 2022. Thus, an earlier effective date is not warranted for service connection for a psychiatric condition. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The November 2022 claim associated with his January 2022 intent to file included a claim for service connection for bilateral knee disabilities. Prior to these filings, there were no formal or informal claims of record for service connection for any condition. Therefore, the Board finds that the appropriate date for the grant of service connection for limited flexion of left and right knees is January 3, 2022, and an earlier effective date is not warranted for service connection for limited flexion of left and right knees. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The Board notes the right knee was found to be normal and without any limitations prior to March 4, 2024, but it is bound by the favorable finding as to the effective date set by the AOJ in the March 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

As to the separate ratings for left knee instability, left limited extension, and right knee limited extension, March 4, 2024, is the appropriate effective date as it is the first date of evidence of such limitations during the period on review. Prior to March 4, 2024, there is no factually ascertainable functional limitations of the right knee nor instability or limitation of extension of the left knee. The evidence is discussed more below.

The November 10, 2022, claim did not include a claim for bilateral pes planus. The first claim to include bilateral pes planus was filed on July 3, 2023. Prior to this filing, there were no formal or informal claims of record for service connection for bilateral pes planus, and the Veteran had not submitted another intent to file. While the Veteran had previously submitted a claim for service connection for "big toes," the record does not suggest he meant to claim pes planus and medical records show no diagnosis of pes planus, or related symptoms, until March 2023. While this is prior to the formal claim, the "look back" period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) applies only to increased ratings, not service connection. Therefore, the Board finds that the appropriate date for the grant of service connection for bilateral pes planus is July 3, 2023. Thus, an earlier effective date is not warranted for service connection for bilateral pes planus. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function, will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged. Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Psychiatric Disorder

Under the general rating formula for mental disorders, the Veteran's psychiatric disorder is rated at 70 percent throughout the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9410. The Veteran seeks an increased rating.

A 70 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has noted the "symptom-driven nature" of the General Rating Formula and that "a Veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vasquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The Federal Circuit has explained that "symptomatology should be the fact-finder's primary focus when deciding entitlement to a given disability rating." Id. at 117.

The psychiatric symptoms listed in the above rating criteria are not exclusive but are examples of typical symptoms for the listed percentage ratings. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). However, if the evidence shows that a veteran has symptoms or effects that cause occupational or social impairment equivalent to what would be caused by the symptoms listed in the diagnostic code, the appropriate equivalent rating will be assigned. Id. at 443.

In January 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA mental health examination. The Veteran was diagnosed with other specified trauma and stressor related disorder. The examiner opined that Veteran's impairments manifested as occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The Veteran reported that he lived with his wife and kids and had a good relationship with them. He reported having friends and socializing with them but not often. He was currently employed. He felt reported feeling the need to be "on guard" and is    always paranoid about his surroundings. He only sleeps 3 to 4 hours on average per night. He denied suicidal or homicidal ideations. He had no delusions or hallucinations. He reported no previous suicidal ideations or hospitalizations. He reported he was not in treatment for mental health. He reported being sober since February 2022, and had previously drunk excessively. He reported socializing used to be easy, but was now hard because of anxiety, fear of judgment, and lots of racing thoughts with worry about bad things happening. Sometimes, his worries turn into panic during sleep. Throughout most of the day, he feels sad and down, and he's not interested in doing things he used to enjoy. His disrupted sleep makes lack energy and motivation. He reported forgetfulness and spaces out during conversation. He often avoids going to public places due to being on high alert and constant vigilance. He feels this negatively affects his relationship with loved ones. The examiner listed the Veteran's symptoms as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective relationships, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene. Examiner reported his appearance was normal, he was engaged through the assessment, alert, fully oriented, presented on time, had normal affect, and fair eye contact. Veteran reported poor hygiene i.e. taking a shower once per week. 

In February 2024, the Veteran sought mental health treatment at the VA for the first time. He reported that his wife thinks he has anxiety and depression, so he agreed to talk to someone. He wants to improve his relationship to his wife and son. He reported difficulty talking to others, especially about his problems. He declined medication. He was provisionally diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression.

While the Board recognizes that the Veteran has impairment related to his psychiatric disorder, the evidence, including the highly probative VA treatment records, shows that his symptoms did not cause total social and occupational impairment during the period on appeal. The Veteran has denied suicidal ideations and maintains a relationship with his wife and son. He also remained employed during the period on review. Records indicate that the Veteran remained oriented to person, place, and time, and was able to take care of his activities of daily living. He demonstrated no delusions, hallucinations, or grossly inappropriate behavior. Considering the record as a whole, the Board finds a 100 percent rating for total social and occupational impairment is not warranted at any time under appeal. The overall disability picture presented throughout the period on review most closely approximates the level of severity contemplated by the currently assigned 70 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.130, Code 9410.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Bilateral Pes Planus

The Veteran is currently rated under Code 5276, flatfoot (pes planus). Under Code 5276, a 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate bilateral or unilateral flatfoot defined as moderate; weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of the tendo achilles, pain on manipulation and use of the feet. A 30 percent rating is assigned for severe bilateral pes planus, with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), accentuated pain on manipulation and use, indication of swelling on use, and characteristic callosities. A maximum 50 percent evaluation is warranted for pronounced bilateral flatfoot with marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo achilles manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5276.

The Veteran's bilateral pes planus was rated 10 percent disabling prior to November 19, 2023, and is rated 50 percent disabling thereafter. The Veteran seeks increased ratings throughout the period on appeal.

The earliest record of foot pain is March 2023 VA medical records. The Veteran complained his feet hurt after working or standing all day. X-rays were normal, and the Veteran was referred to physical therapy and recommended shoe inserts. No diagnosis was given at the time. There is no other evidence of treatment at the VA for bilateral pes planus.

In November 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA flatfoot (pes planus) examination. The Veteran reported pain was a dull ache that existed all day after working for an hour or so, and sharp pains when he had flareups. He described his current symptoms as ingrown toenails, bruised/painful heels, and pain wearing his work boots. He reported treating with arch supports, rest, and elevation. The examiner diagnosed him with ingrown toenails, bilateral flat foot, and plantar fasciitis. The Veteran described his flareups as occurring daily, lasting the rest of day, and having sharp stabbing pain. Precipitating factors were heavy use/overuse, and alleviating factors were rest and elevation. The functional impact of his conditions was described as difficulty with frequent bending, standing/sitting more than 30 minutes without a break, and lifting more than 30 pounds in an occupational setting. The examiner attributed the following symptoms to pes planus: pain on use of both feet, accentuated on use, pain on manipulation and accentuated on manipulation, and swelling on use. The examiner noted characteristic calluses. Veteran reported he tried arch supports but remains symptomatic. Examination showed decreased longitudinal arch height of both feet on weight bearing, weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, and inward bowing of Achilles' tendon. Examiner also reported some functional loss due to plantar fasciitis, for which the Veteran had not had surgical treatment. Examiner noted pain on physical exam that contributes to functional loss, and less movement than normal, swelling, disturbance of locomotion, interference with standing, fatigue, and lack of endurance also contributed to functional loss. There was also pain on active motion and weight-bearing.

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA flatfoot (pes planus) examination. The Veteran reported his wife told him his arches fell in 2020 while he was in service. He described his current symptoms as flat feet, falling arches with weight bearing, pain with prolonged walking or standing, and burning pain in the morning. He said he had not current treatment, but avoided walking or standing for prolonged periods of time. The Veteran denied flareups. The examiner attributed the following symptoms to pes planus: pain on use of both feet, accentuated on use, and pain on manipulation and accentuated on manipulation. There was no swelling on use or no characteristic calluses. He had regularly used arch supports but remained symptomatic. He had extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of both feet not improved by orthopedic shoes/appliances, and decreased longitudinal arch height on both feet on weight-bearing. Examiner noted pain on physical exam that contributed to functional loss, as well as disturbance of locomotion and interference with standing. Functional loss from pain with prolonged walking and standing, pain with weightbearing. He has pain on active and passive motion and weight-bearing. He reported he was currently employed and lost 0 to 1 week of time in the last year due to bilateral pes planus. 

	Prior to November 19, 2023

Considering the Veteran's overall symptomatology and the resulting impairment stemming therefrom throughout the period on appeal, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the disability picture presented, most closely approximates the level of severity contemplated by the 30 percent rating for bilateral pes planus. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, Code 5276. While the November 2023 VA examination is the only evidence of record obtained from July 3, 2022, to November 19, 2023, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral pes planus with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, and characteristic callosities. Additionally, the Veteran is competent to report his pain. 

During this period, the reported symptoms of pes planus did not rise to the level of a 50 percent rating. Neither the Veteran nor the examiner reported extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet or severe spasm of the tendo achilles on manipulation. Thus, an initial evaluation in excess of 30 percent is not warranted prior to November 19, 2023.

	Since November 19, 2023

In the February 2024 VA examination, bilateral pes planus included the additional symptoms of extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances. This is the first sign of worsening of the Veteran's condition.

The February 2024 rating decision assigned a 50 percent rating for bilateral pes planus effective November 19, 2023, which is the date an intent to file a claim was received by the VA and followed by a claim for service connection for pes planus on January 24, 2024. However, the Veteran had previously been notified that his July 2023 claim for bilateral pes planus had been granted in a December 2023 rating decision that the Veteran timely received. The AOJ appears to have processed the January 2024 service connection claim as a claim for an increased rating, and the February 2024 rating decision assigned a 50 percent rating based on the filing date as opposed to objective evidence of worsening. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the 50 percent rating under Code 5276 is appropriate since November 19, 2023. 50 percent is the highest schedular evaluation for pes planus. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a.

The Board notes that the November 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral plantar fascitis, stating such was a likely progression of pes planus, while the February 2024 examiner did not find plantar fasciitis.   

Entitlement to a separate evaluation for plantar fasciitis has been considered, but given that the criteria currently applied fully consider tenderness of the plantar surfaces and pain with use, such would constitute prohibited pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  VA may not compensate the same symptom and impairment under multiple Codes.  Moreover, the condition is not consistently diagnosed. 

Bilateral Knees

The Veteran is seeking increased evaluation for his left knee and right knee disabilities for the entire period on appeal. Since January 3, 2022, the Veteran's left knee has been rated at 10 percent for limited flexion under Code 5260; and since March 4, 2024, 10 percent for instability under Code 5257 and 10 percent for limited extension under Code 5261. Since January 3, 2022, the Veteran's right knee has been rated at 10 percent for limited flexion under Code 5260; and since March 4, 2024, 0 percent for limited extension under Code 5261. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, 5260, 5261.

A Veteran can receive multiple compensable ratings for the knee as the applicable diagnostic codes contemplate specific symptoms, rather than the disability as a whole. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256-5263. However, while separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury, so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of the symptomatology of the other condition, the evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes would result in pyramiding, which must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, functional loss due to painful motion is to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint. If the limitation of motion is not compensable under the applicable Code, the minimum compensable rating is assigned. Further, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In evaluating any disability based on limitation of motion, VA must consider the actual degree of functional impairment imposed by pain, incoordination, weakness, fatigue, and lack of endurance with repetitive motion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). While pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded. See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011). Additionally, flare-ups must be factored into an examiner's assessment of functional loss. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

For limitation of motion, there are two potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes. Code 5260 assigns evaluations based on limitation of flexion. Limitation to 60 degrees merits a noncompensable, or 0 percent, evaluation. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 45 degrees. Limitation to 30 degrees flexion warrants a 20 percent evaluation, and a 30 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 15 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Code 5261 assigns evaluations based on limitation of extension. Limitation to 5 degrees merits a noncompensable, or 0 percent, evaluation. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 10 degrees. Limitation to 15 degrees extension warrants a 20 percent evaluation. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for limitation to 20 degrees of extension. A 40 percent evaluation is assigned for extension limited to 30 degrees. A 50 percent evaluation is assigned for extension limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

For VA purposes, normal range of knee is from 0 degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Code 5256 is utilized for evaluation of ankylosis or the functional equivalent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. As there is motion of the right and left knees, this Code is not applicable here. 

Code 5257 evaluates disabilities of the knee based on the degree of subluxation and instability of the joint. A 10 percent evaluation is assigned for sprain, incomplete ligament tear or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for either (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g. cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation; or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g. cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation. Additionally, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for patellar instability when the condition is diagnosed and involves the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without a history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provided for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for diagnosed patellar instability involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provided for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. A 30 percent evaluation is assigned for a diagnosed patellofemoral instability condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. Note (1) to Code 5257 for patellar instability, defines the patellofemoral complex as consisting of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. Note (2) specifies that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).

Separate ratings may be assigned for knee disability under Diagnostic Codes 5257 and 5003/5010 where there is x-ray evidence of arthritis in addition to recurrent subluxation or lateral instability. The symptomatology supporting the evaluations does not overlap; limitation of motion and stability are distinct from each other.  See generally VAOPGCPREC 23-97 and VAOPGCREC 9-98. Further, VAOPGCPREC 9-04 provides that where a claimant has both limitation of flexion and limitation of extension of the same leg separate ratings under diagnostic codes 5260 and 5261 are warranted to adequately compensate for functional loss associated with injury to the leg. By extension, evaluations under Code 5257 and either or both Code 5260 and Code 5261 are permissible, as each of the three codes measures different criteria. By contrast, an evaluation under Code 5003 may not be combined with one under Code 5260 or Code 5261; Code 5010 does not specify the plane of limited motion considered, and so evaluation under either of the other limitation of motion Codes forecloses the possibility of multiple evaluations. See generally VAOPGCPREC 23-97 and VAOPGCREC 9-98; 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

There is no evidence of a meniscal injury, so Codes 5258 and 5259 are not applicable. There is no evidence of impairment of the tibia and fibula, so Code 5262 is also not applicable. 

The Veteran was afforded a December 2022 VA knee examination. While the examiner focused the examination on the left knee, right knee observations and range-of-motion (ROM) measurements were taken. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with patellofemoral pain syndrome in left knee. Veteran reported injuring his knee in service, and experiencing knee pain ever since. Veteran denied flareups.  Initial ROM measurements were normal in both knees without evidence of pain. Passive ROM of the left knee revealed flexion limited to 120 degrees due to pain and decreased movement. The examiner noted the right knee was undamaged. The examiner estimated no additional loss of ROM with repeated use over time for the left knee, but also noted pain and weakness contribute to functional loss. The examiner listed interference with standing and sitting and weakened movement as additional factors contributing to disability of the left knee. Instability testing was normal. No other abnormalities were found.

The Board finds the March 2023 VA examination is not adequate only as to ROM estimations for the left knee for flexion as the examiner contradictorily concluded Veteran would have no estimated no additional loss of flexion ROM with repeated use over time for the left knee, but also noted pain and weakness would contribute to functional loss. The subsequent March 2024 VA examination is adequate, and so will be used to determine Veteran's left knee limitation of flexion throughout the period on review. There is no indication the Veteran's extension of either knee was limited at the time of the March 2023 VA examination.

March 2023 VA medical records show the Veteran had bilateral knee x-rays that were within normal limits. The Veteran complained of bilateral chronic knee pain that felt like "bone on bone" and was worse when climbing stairs.

A March 2024 VA knee examination included the opinion that stated the Veteran's right knee problems were related to his left knee disability. He was diagnosed with bilateral knee strain and left patellofemoral pain syndrome. Veteran reported pain from overcompensation. He described current symptoms as sharp pain, tingling, numbness, left knee instability, stiffness, popping, and grinding. He utilized PT, RICE, and knee immobilizer as treatment. He reported flareups in his left knee only. He described the flareups as daily, lasting 2 to 3 hours, intense/sharp pain and swelling, and 10/10 severity. They were precipitated by activity, and alleviated by RICE. Functional impairment of the left knee was described as difficulty with squatting, running, and walking for an extended period of time. The Veteran did not report functional loss in right knee. He reported his left knee pops out. Initial ROM of the right knee was normal. In the left knee, flexion was limited to 100 degrees and extension was limited to 10 degrees. Pain, weakness, limited motion, and functional loss were noted in the left knee. Both knees had evidence of crepitus. The left knee had tenderness to palpation at posterior side. Observed repetitive use was normal on the right side, but the Veteran refused to perform ROM testing on his left knee due to fear of pain. The examiner estimated additional loss of ROM with repeated use over time to equal to 135 degrees flexion and 5 degrees extension in the right knee. In the left knee, examiner estimated flexion would be limited to 95 degrees and 10 degrees extension. Limitations of ROM were from pain in both knees, and fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, and incoordination in the left knee. Flareups in the left knee were estimated to have ROM limited to 90 degrees flexion and 10 degrees extension. Additional factors contributing to disability of left knee were noted as swelling, interference with standing, disturbance of locomotion, and less movement than normal. There was no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability for either knee found. Stability testing produced normal results. The Veteran reported he had a prescription for left knee brace due to recurrent patellar instability without surgical repair. The Veteran used the brace constantly. Bilateral shin splints symptoms were not present, but Veteran had had bilateral shin splints in the past. Veteran reported he worked full time, but had lost 2 to 4 weeks of work time in last 12 months due to knee disabilities. His job required him to climb, kneel, squat, and stand for a long period of time which caused pain.

	Left Knee

Regarding limitation of flexion, the Veteran was assigned a 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion due to his patellofemoral pain syndrome causing limitation of flexion which would otherwise be non-compensable under Code 5260. At its worse, the March 2024 examiner found left flexion would be limited to 90 degrees during flareups. While the Veteran continued to report pain and guarding his movements to prevent pain, there is no evidence that the Veteran's left knee flexion worsened to 45 degrees or less at any time during the appeal period. The is no indication that the Veteran's flareups were happening more frequently or for longer periods of time. The Veteran was able to ambulate to and from appointments, and records indicate the Veteran did not have ankylosis. Thus, the Board finds an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent is not appropriate for limitation of flexion under Code 5260.

Regarding limitations of extension, the Veteran was assigned a 10 percent rating for limitation of extension due to extension being limited to 10 degrees under Code 5261 for the first time at the March 2024 VA examination. There is no indication extension was limited to 15 degrees during the period on review. Thus, an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for limited extension is not appropriate under Code 5261.

Regarding instability, the Veteran was assigned a 10 percent rating due to recurrent patellar instability without surgical repair requiring prescription for brace, as was noted for the first time at the March 2024 VA examination. The records do not indicate any surgical repair or that instability was from an unrepaired or failed repair of a ligament tear. Residual symptoms included pain, in addition to instability. Thus, a higher rating of 20 percent is not warranted.

	Right Knee

As noted above, the Veteran's right knee ROM has been limited, at worst, to 135 degrees of the flexion endpoint and 5 degrees extension. Neither limitation is compensable under Code 5260 or 5261. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The Veteran is assigned a 10 percent rating due to pain producing limited flexion of 135 degrees under Code 5260 during repeated use over time. While the Veteran has reported right knee pain throughout the period on review, there is no indication there was functional loss of the right knee until the March 2024 examination. No other right knee abnormalities or functional loss besides limitation of ROM was found. The Veteran was able to ambulate to and from appointments, and records indicate the Veteran did not have ankylosis or instability. There is no indication flexion was limited to 45 degrees or extension was limited to 15 degrees. Thus, an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for limited flexion or a compensable rating for limited extension is not appropriate.

Finally, the record does not show any additional symptoms, or their severity, that is not already contemplated by the schedular criteria of his disability ratings for left and right knees. Even with consideration of the DeLuca factors, the Veteran is compensated for such throughout the period on appeal. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; the weight of the evidence is persuasively against a higher rating, and the doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Remand is permitted only to correct a pre-decisional error or for any other error in fulfilling a statutory or regulatory duty, the correction of which raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The Board finds pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand in this case.

Prior to the decision on appeal, a VA medical opinion was obtained in December 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's back pain was less likely as not incurred in or caused by service because the Veteran reported in service he had "6 degree scoliotic curve" as a child, which resolved with treatment, although he still had pain. He also reported continued pain that is manageable with stretches. The examiner concluded without further explanation that the Veteran's back pain was a pre-existing condition and not related to service. This opinion is inadequate for several reasons, including because the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, and even if it had been, the opinion uses the wrong standard of proof. Failure to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion is a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error requiring remand to provide an opinion on the etiology of the Veteran's low back disability.

First, the Board notes that to have basic eligibility for veterans benefits based on a period of duty as a member of a state Army National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States, see 10 U.S.C.A. § 12401, or must have performed "full-time duty" under the provisions of 32 U.S.C.A. §§ [315], 502, 503, 504, or 505. See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(21), (22)(C); Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 58 (2007). With specific regard to National Guard service, the presumptions of soundness, aggravation, and service connection for chronic diseases do not apply to claimants, even those with Veteran status from prior periods of service, for claims based on periods of ACDUTRA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (24), 1137; Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010). Here, the Veteran is claiming he injured his back during a period of Federal service from May 2020 to December 2020, which is a time that qualifies for the presumptions of soundness, aggravation, and service connection for chronic diseases.

Second, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that in June 2020, the Veteran's pre-deployment health assessment was normal, and no back issues were noted. September 2020 deployment records show the Veteran complained of back pain, attributing it to a scoliotic curve he had in childhood. His November 2020 post-deployment health assessment reported back pain that kept him up at night. His November 2020 separation examination noted recurrent back pain. March 2023 VA lumbar spine x-rays do not contain symptoms of, or diagnosis of, scoliosis. Furthermore, the December 2023 examiner did not diagnosis the Veteran with scoliosis, despite his finding that the Veteran had an unnamed pre-existing condition based on the Veteran's pronouncement that he had scoliosis as a child. There is no actual diagnosis of scoliosis in the medical records. 

Thus, the Board finds that despite the Veteran's September 2020 statement during treatment that he had scoliosis as a child, no deficiencies or symptoms of the lumbar spine were noted at the time of his entrance examination, or during pre-deployment. He was able to pass his physical and participate in basic training without any problem, and generally denied back pain in his STRs until September 2020. The record contains no clear and unmistakable evidence showing a lumbar spine condition pre-existed service. Thus, the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted, and should be treated as such when obtaining an adequate medical opinion on remand. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA lumbar spine condition; the claims folder must be reviewed in conjunction with the examination.

The examiner must identify all current disabilities of the low back, and for each, must opine as to whether such is at least as likely as not caused or aggravated by service.

A full and complete rationale for all opinions expressed is required, to include discussion of the Veteran's STRs noting complaints following deployment and relevant lay statements regarding onset and continuity of symptoms.
