FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's diastolic blood pressure was not predominantly 100 or more, and he did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure that was predominantly 100 or more.

2. There is no rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable evaluation for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1968 to December 1968 and from December 1968 to November 1971. The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse, and she is a substitute claimant.

This appeal stems from a February 2024 higher-level review decision (tinnitus and hypertension) and a February 2024 rating decision (heart disease and atrial fibrillation). In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, for the issues of hypertension and tinnitus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. For the issues of heart disease and atrial fibrillation, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to a higher disability rating for heart disease and service connection for atrial fibrillation and tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension is denied.

The Appellant appeals the denial of a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension. Hypertension is rated under to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, DC 7101. Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. Id. A 20 percent rating requires either diastolic pressure that is predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure that is predominantly 200 or more. Id. A 40 percent rating requires diastolic pressure that is predominantly 120 or more.

The rating criteria do not define the term "predominantly." Merriam-Webster defines predominantly to mean "for the most part" or "mainly." See "predominantly," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominantly.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died before he could be examined to determine the severity of his hypertension.

The Veteran's treatment records show that on January 3, 2012, his blood pressure was 132/80. On January 10, 2013, his blood pressure was 128/78. It was 138/78 on January 31, 2012. On April 10, 2013, it was 134/80.

The Veteran's blood pressure was 110/80 on March 28, 2017. On September 28, 2017, it was 128/76.

On December 15, 2020, the Veteran's blood pressure was 110/74.

The Veteran's blood pressure was 107/78 on September 28, 2021.

On July 7, 2022, his blood pressure was 122/82. The next day, it was 127/82.

The Veteran's treatment records state that his blood pressure was 112/87 on December 5, 2022.

Although the Board has not listed every blood pressure reading in the record, it has carefully reviewed the record and considered all the blood pressure readings. The Veteran's blood pressure readings do not demonstrate that his diastolic pressure readings were predominantly 100 or more, nor do they demonstrate a history of diastolic pressure readings that were predominantly 100 or more. The overwhelming majority of the readings demonstrate a diastolic pressure of less than 100. Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a compensable rating for hypertension, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The Appellant's VA Form 10812 states that she is appealing the issue of "Service connection for Bilateral Hearing Loss" from a decision dated March 4, 2024.

Claimants initiate an appeal to the Board by filing an NOD on the form that the Secretary prescribes. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a); see 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, the NOD must be filed within one year of the notice of the AOJ decision. Id. at § 7105(b)(1)(A); see Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 267-270 (2024) (en banc) (holding that the timeliness of the filing of a VA Form 10182 is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule). The Board decides questions regarding an NOD's timeliness or adequacy in the first instance. Id. § 7105(b)(1)(C).

The AOJ issued a rating decision in February 2024 that it mailed on March 4, 2024. The February 2024 rating decision adjudicated claims involving the issues of hypertension, tinnitus, glioblastoma, left arm paralysis, left leg paralysis, left facial paralysis, seizures, left knee arthritis, and right knee arthritis. The decision does not deny a claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Board has reviewed the record, and it finds that there are no rating decisions denying entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss in the record.

The Board finds that the Appellant's VA Form 10182 is procedurally defective to the extent that it seeks Board review of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333-334 (2021) (the Board may dismiss appeals under claims-processing rationales). Because the AOJ has never issued a decision denying entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, the Appellant's VA Form 10182 is not timely because it is premature. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 267-270. Because the VA Form 10182 is premature, the Board will dismiss the appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. See Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63, 79 (2014) (dismissing an appeal when the notice of appeal was premature). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for status post coronary artery bypass graft with coronary artery disease (also claimed as myocardial ischemic and congestive heart failure with apical hypokinesis) (heart disease) is remanded.

The Board finds that remand is warranted to correct a predecisional duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Unfortunately, the Veteran died before he could be evaluated to determine the current severity of his service-connected heart disease. The rating criteria provide higher ratings based on evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent or based on METs results. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7107, General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart. When exercising testing cannot be done, the medical examiner can estimate the level of activity expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs). Id. at Note (2). The Board lacks the medical expertise to determine whether the Veteran's treatment records contain sufficient information to determine whether a higher disability rating is warranted. Therefore, the Board will remand the matter to obtain a record review medical opinion on whether the severity of the Veteran's disability can be determined in terms of the rating criteria. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for atrial fibrillation with irregular heartbeat is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

The Board finds that remand is required because toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) examinations are required. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). If a Veteran claims compensation with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a TERA and there is insufficient evidence to establish service connection, the Secretary shall obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). The AOJ favorably determined that the Veteran participated in a TERA. Specifically, he was exposed to herbicide agents. The record contains treatment records containing evidence of atrial fibrillation. The Veteran's August 2022 application for benefits states that he had a current chronic tinnitus disability. Because tinnitus is capable of lay observation, the Board finds that the Veteran's application is competent evidence of a current disability. The evidence is not sufficient to grant service connection for either disability. Therefore, the Board will remand to obtain medical opinions as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's disabilities are due to his TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the Veteran's electronic claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain an opinion regarding the Veteran's status post coronary artery bypass graft with coronary artery disease. The Veteran's electronic claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be accessible to the designated professional for review. The examiner must provide a detailed rationale for any opinion that he or she provides, and the opinion must state that the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's electronic claims file and this remand.

After the examiner reviews the claims file, the examiner must provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria. The examiner must specifically address whether there is evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation documented by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, X-ray, or equivalent. The examiner must also provide an opinion on whether it is possible to estimate the Veteran's level of activity in METs. The examiner must provide an adequate rationale to support any METs estimation or an adequate rationale to support any explanation of why such an estimation is not possible.

2. Send the Veteran's electronic claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain an opinion regarding the Veteran's atrial fibrillation. The Veteran's electronic claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be accessible to the designated professional for review. The examiner must provide a detailed rationale for any opinion that he or she provides, and the opinion must state that the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's electronic claims file and this remand.

After reviewing the claims file, the examiner must respond to the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's atrial fibrillation is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents. The examiner must consider and discuss (1) the total potential exposure through all the Veteran's applicable military deployments and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all findings and opinions, and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.

3. Send the Veteran's electronic claims file to an appropriate medical professional to obtain an opinion regarding the Veteran's tinnitus. The Veteran's electronic claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be accessible to the designated professional for review. The examiner must provide a detailed rationale for any opinion that he or she provides, and the opinion must state that the examiner has reviewed the Veteran's electronic claims file and this remand.

After reviewing the claims file, the examiner must respond to the following:

Is it at least as likely as not (at least approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents. The examiner must consider and discuss (1) the total potential exposure through all the Veteran's applicable military deployments and (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all findings and opinions, and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.
