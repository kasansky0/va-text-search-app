REMANDED

Service connection for prostate cancer.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the United States Marine Corps from February 1982 to February 1985.  His appeal stems from an October 2023 rating decision in which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for prostate cancer.  In November 2023, he submitted a VA Form 20-0996 and requested a Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the October 2023 decision in accordance with the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

However, in a March 2024 HLR rating decision, a Decision Review Officer (DRO) again denied service connection for the Veteran's claim.  In so doing, the DRO considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f).  

Subsequently in April 2024, the Veteran appealed the DRO's HLR rating decision to the Board via a Form 10182 and requested that his appeal be reviewed on the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, in assessing the Veteran's claim, the Board has not considered evidence during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2023 rating decision that was subjected to an HLR.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.801.  Rather, it has only considered the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.     

The Veteran's claim of service connection for prostate cancer is remanded for correction of a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the March 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal.  To this end, under the Sergeant Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), VA is required to consider whether the Veteran's disability was the product of an in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  38 U.S.C. § 1168.  Specifically, VA is required to provide a disability examination and secure a medical nexus opinion when a veteran submits a compensation claim, has evidence of a disability and participation in a TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability, unless the Secretary determines that there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and the TERA at issue.  38 U.S.C. § 1168; see also Pub.L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

Here, the October 2023 and March 2024 HLR decision conceded that the Veteran participated in a TERA, citing his exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  In June 2023 and September 2023, a VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that his prostate cancer was caused by his in-service TERA, to include his exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.  However, the opinions are inadequate for rating purposes.

Specifically, the examiner based the opinions on the lack of an Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) report in the record, offering that as a result, a direct causative link could not be established between the Veteran's prostate cancer and in-service TERA.  As the June 2023 and September 2023 TERA opinions were based on the lack of evidence in the record, they are inadequate for rating purposes.  Therefore, remand is warranted to address the nature and etiology of the Veteran's prostate cancer, to include whether it stems from a TERA or is otherwise related to his active service.  See generally Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (where VA undertakes to obtain an examination or medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or medical opinion is adequate). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of his prostate cancer.  The claims file and a complete copy of this Remand must be made available to the clinician.  All diagnostic testing deemed to be necessary by the clinician should be accomplished.

2. Applying general medical knowledge, the clinician's experience, the clinical records, and the lay statements, the clinician is instructed to provide opinions responsive to the following questions:

3. Is it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's prostate cancer was incurred in service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to specifically include in-service exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune?

4. Is the Veteran's prostate cancer due to the combined synergistic effect of his total potential toxic exposure in service?

5. In rendering these opinions, the clinician must consider and discuss the Veteran's in-service exposures to burn pits and other toxins, to include fine particulate matter, as well as burning oil fields, fumes from tent heaters, paint fumes, and diesel fuel fumes.  The clinician is also instructed to address both toxic exposure events during deployment, to specifically include exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, and any relevant non-deployment toxic exposure events.

6. It would be helpful to the Board if the clinician could explain why the medical evidence is either consistent with or inconsistent with findings that the Veteran's prostate cancer: (a) was incurred in or otherwise related to service; and (b) was due to the combined synergistic effect of his total potential toxic exposure in service.

7. Thorough rationales for all opinions must be provided.
