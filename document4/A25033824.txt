ORDER

The appeal as to entitlement to an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar enthesophy is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On April 2, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal as to entitlement to an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar enthesophy by the appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2008 to August 2018.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. On April 2, 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

1. Entitlement to an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for left knee degenerative arthritis with patellar enthesophy

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant's authorized representative has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

In an April 2, 2025 correspondence, the Veteran's representative stated, "Please accept this letter as formal notification that the above-named claimant wishes to withdraw" the issue of an increased evaluation for the left knee. The Veteran's name and VA file number was noted in the correspondence.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
