FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not appeal the initial rating assigned for bilateral hearing loss in an April 2009 rating decision; no communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of the April 2009 rating decision and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for that disability; and the Veteran did not meet the criteria for entitlement to a 40 percent rating for that disability during the review period prior to August 7, 2023.

2. The Veteran did not perfect an appeal to the Board of the initial rating assigned for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia, in the April 2009 rating decision and no communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of a July 2011 statement of the case as to the issue and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for that disability; however, it was factually ascertainable as of August 30, 2022, that the Veteran had severe IBS with diarrhea and more or less constant abdominal distress such that he met the criteria for entitlement to a 30 percent rating for that disability from that date.

3. The Veteran did not appeal the April 2009 rating decision's grant of noncompensable initial ratings for tenosynovitis of both long fingers; no communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of the April 2009 rating decision and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for that disability; and it is not factually ascertainable that he met the criteria for 10 percent ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers and bilateral long fingers or for a compensable rating for tenosynovitis of the bilateral ring fingers and bilateral little fingers during the review period prior to February 3, 2023.

4. Basic entitlement to service connection for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was severed in a September 2024 rating decision.

5. No communication was received from the Veteran prior to February 3, 2022, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis.

6. No communication was received from the Veteran prior to August 10, 2022, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis.

8. No communication was received from the Veteran prior to February 3, 2023, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

9. No communication was received from the Veteran prior to February 3, 2023, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.

10. Throughout the review period, the Veteran was in receipt of 10 percent ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers and the bilateral long fingers, which is the maximum schedular rating available for those disabilities, and all manifestations of the disabilities were adequately considered under his schedular ratings.

11. Throughout the review period, the Veteran was in receipt of noncompensable ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral ring fingers and the bilateral little fingers, which is the maximum schedular rating available for those disability, and all manifestations of the disabilities were adequately considered under his schedular ratings.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from September 1980 to November 2008.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of July 2023, August 2023, and September 2023 decisions.  In May 2023, the regional office (RO) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023, August 2023, and September 2023 decisions.

In his May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023, August 2023, and September 2023 RO decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, as applicable to the issues decided in each of those decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the applicable decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

For the issues denied herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted but that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the issue(s) considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

For the issues remanded herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those issues.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran's May 2024 VA Form 10182 for this appeal also listed issues pertaining to effective dates assigned for the service-connected radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, lumbar spine disability, and right ankle disability.  However, the July 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and is the applicable decision for those issues, did not establish any effective dates with regard to those disabilities.  Therefore, those attempted appeals are not proper, and the Board will take no further action as to them.

In a brief submitted along with the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran's representative argues that there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the April 2009 rating decision's failure to grant a separate rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy and compensable ratings for the service-connected bilateral hand disabilities.  The claim for a finding of CUE in the earlier decision is separate and distinct from earlier effective date issues on appeal.  The RO has not adjudicated the CUE claim.  Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that issue.  The Veteran may resubmit the claim to the RO or notify the RO that the issue is still pending.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with regard to the duty to notify or duty to assist as they pertain to the issues denied in this decision.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The analysis in this decision focuses on the most relevant evidence and on what the evidence shows or does not show with respect to the issues denied in this decision.  The Veteran should not assume that evidence that is not explicitly discussed in the decision has been overlooked.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (noting that the law requires only that reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the claimant be addressed).

Earlier Effective Dates

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 7, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 7, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss.  He has not presented any particular argument as to why he believes an earlier effective date is warranted, nor has he identified an earlier effective date that he believes is more appropriate.

The August 2023 rating decision granted a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss effective February 3, 2023.  The May 2024 HLR decision found that there was CUE in the assignment of February 3, 2023, as the effective date for the increased rating and that an effective date of August 7, 2023, should be assigned.  The Veteran's appeal of the May 2024 HLR decision necessarily includes the issue of whether the finding of CUE as to the effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss was proper.  The Board will address that issue below.

The effective date for the award of service connection is either the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

The effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, an increased rating may be awarded up to one year prior to receipt of the claim if the evidence shows an increase in disability was factually ascertainable during that period.  38 C.F.R. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  For this purpose, the evidence must show that the increase in disability was sufficient to warrant a higher rating under the rating criteria.  Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1992).  Thus, determining the proper date for an increased rating requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating and (2) a review of all the evidence of record for the one year prior to the date of the claim to determine when an increase in disability was "factually ascertainable" in terms of meeting or approximating the criteria for a higher rating.  See id. at 521.

Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined as a "formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit."  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014).  An informal claim included "[a]ny communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits..."  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014).  Claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, must be submitted on the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The Board will apply the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, to all correspondence received from the Veteran prior to that date.

The Veteran submitted an original claim for entitlement to service connection for, among other things, hearing loss in October 2008.  In the April 2009 rating decision, the RO granted service connection and a noncompensable initial rating for left ear hearing loss, but denied service connection for right ear hearing loss.  The letter informing the Veteran of the April 2009 rating decision was enclosed with a VA Form 4107 that explained his right to appeal the decision.

In April 2010, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement as to the April 2009 rating decision.  However, that notice of disagreement does not express dissatisfaction or disagreement with the initial rating assigned for the service-connected left ear hearing loss or with the denial of service connection for right ear hearing loss in the April 2009 rating decision.  Therefore, the submission may not be considered a notice of disagreement as to the April 2009 rating decision in that regard.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.201 (2010).

In addition, no evidence was received during the one-year period following issuance of the April 2009 rating decision that may be considered new and material as to the initial rating assigned for left ear hearing or as to the claim for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.

Accordingly, the Veteran did not submit a timely notice of disagreement as to the initial rating assigned for left ear hearing loss in the April 2009 rating decision or as to that decision's denial of service connection for right ear hearing loss, and new and material evidence as to those issues was not received within the one-year appeal period following issuance of the April 2009 rating decision.  As such, the Veteran did not complete a timely appeal of the April 2009 rating decision as to those issues, and the decision is final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 19.20, 19.21, 19.52, 20.1103.  The original October 2008 claim therefore cannot serve as a basis for an earlier effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss.

No communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of the April 2009 rating decision and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for that bilateral hearing loss.  Therefore, the earliest effective date available of the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss is February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim.  As such, the Board will determine whether the criteria for a 40 percent rating were met during the period from February 3, 2022, to August 6, 2023.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," in all claims for increased ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 519 (2007).

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

As discussed above, for a higher rating to be granted during the one-year period prior to the claim, it must be factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during that period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  In this case, there is no evidence that dates during the one-year prior to the February 3, 2023, intent to file that documents the severity of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss.  Therefore, it is not factually ascertainable that the criteria for a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss were met at any time during that one-year period.  As such, an effective date prior to February 3, 2023, must be denied.

Regarding the period from February 3, 2023, to August 6, 2023, at a March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran's Maryland CNC word list speech recognition scores and puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	Word

RIGHT	25	15	30	45	28.75	100%

LEFT	20	20	50	65	38.75	98%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level I in the left ear.  Entering those numeric designations into 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, results in a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown in either ear.  As such, the March 2023 VA examination does not show that the criteria for a rating of 40 percent were met.

At a May 2023 VA examination, the Veteran's Maryland CNC word list speech recognition scores and puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	Word

RIGHT	30	25	40	50	36.25	96%

LEFT	25	30	60	70	46.25	86%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level II in the left ear.  Entering those numeric designations into 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, results in a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown in either ear.  As such, the May 2023 VA examination also does not show that the criteria for a rating of 40 percent were met.  Therefore, the relevant evidence does not show that the criteria for a rating of 40 percent for bilateral hearing loss were met during the period from February 3, 2023, to August 6, 2023.

Next, the Board will address the RO's finding in the May 2024 HLR decision that there was CUE in the August 2023 rating decision's assignment of February 3, 2023, as the effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss.  RO decisions may be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of error; it is the kind of error of fact or law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  See, e.g., Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310 (1992).

As discussed above, the relevant evidence establishes that the criteria for entitlement to a 40 percent rating were clearly and unmistakably not met prior to August 7, 2023.  Specifically, the only relevant evidence dating prior to August 7, 2023, is the March 2023 VA examination and the May 2023 VA examination.  It is undebatable that both of those VA examinations reflect a noncompensable level of hearing impairment under Table VI, Table VII, and Diagnostic Code 6100, and do not show that the criteria for a 40 percent rating for hearing loss were met.

At a further VA examination conducted on August 7, 2023, the Veteran's Maryland CNC word list speech recognition scores and puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	HERTZ

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	Word

RIGHT	35	35	45	55	42.5	52%

LEFT	35	35	65	75	52.5	44%

Applying the results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level VI in the right ear and Level VIII in the left ear.  Entering those numeric designations into 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, results in a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown in either ear.  As such, the August 7, 2023, VA examination is the earliest dated evidence showing that the criteria for a 40 percent rating were met.

It is undebatable that the relevant evidence shows that the criteria for a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6100 were not met prior to August 7, 2023, and that those criteria were met from August 7, 2023.  Thus, the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that entitlement to a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss did not arise until August 7, 2023.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  As such, the RO's finding in the May 2024 HLR decision that there was CUE in the August 2023 rating decision's assignment of February 3, 2023, as the effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss was proper.

In summary, the RO's finding in the May 2024 HLR decision that there was CUE in the August 2023 rating decision's assignment of February 3, 2023, as the effective date for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss was proper.  Furthermore, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 7, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a 30 percent rating for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia.  In the brief submitted along with the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the representative argues that the effective date should be no later than August 10, 2022, which is the effective date for the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, also known as the PACT Act.

The Veteran's October 2008 claim also included a claim for entitlement to service connection for "chronic reflux esophagitis (GERD)" and IBS.  In the April 2009 rating decision, the RO granted service connection and an initial rating of 10 percent for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia.  The Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement as to the 10 percent initial rating in April 2010.  In July 2011, the RO issued a statement of the case as to the appeal.  The Veteran did not submit a timely substantive appeal following issuance of that statement of the case.  As such, he did not complete a timely appeal to the Board of the April 2009 rating decision's assignment of a 10 percent initial rating for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.22, 19.52, 20.1103.  Therefore, the Veteran's October 2008 original claim for service connection may not serve as the basis for an earlier effective date for the award of a 30 percent rating for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia.

No communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of the July 2011 statement of the case and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia.  Therefore, the earliest effective date available for the award of a 30 percent rating for that disability is February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim.

As discussed above, for a higher rating to be granted during the one-year period prior to the claim, it must be factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during that period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The Veteran's IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia, is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346-7319.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  In this case, the use of Diagnostic Code 7346-7319 to rate the Veteran's service-connected IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia, reflects that the disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 7346 for hiatal hernia with reference to Diagnostic Code 7319 for irritable bowel syndrome.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

Under Diagnostic Code 7319 as in effect during the relevant period, a 30 percent rating was warranted for severe IBS with diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress.

Under Diagnostic Code 7346 as in effect during the relevant period, a 30 percent rating was warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

Turning to the relevant evidence for consideration, an August 30, 2022, VA treatment note indicates that the Veteran reported a worsening in his IBS symptoms over the prior year with more bowel movements during the day, more urgency, diarrhea, loose stools, and partially digested food in his stools.  In December 2022, he again reported a worsening in his IBS symptoms over the prior year with three loose bowel movements per day, flatulence, and cramping.  The Board finds that this evidence shows that it was factually ascertainable as of August 30, 2022, that the Veteran had severe IBS with diarrhea and more or less constant abdominal distress such that a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7319 was warranted as of that date.  Although the Veteran reported that his IBS symptoms had worsened at some point prior to August 30, 2022, his reports in that regard are vague and do not provide sufficient evidence that it was factually ascertainable from a specific date between February 3, 2022, and August 29, 2022, that the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7319 and/or Diagnostic Code 7346 were met.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to August 30, 2022, for the award of a 30 percent rating may not be granted.

Regarding the representative's assertion that an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, is warranted based on the passage of PACT Act, the Veteran's higher rating of 30 percent for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia, was not granted based on any provision in the PACT Act.  Therefore, there is no basis in the law for awarding an earlier effective date based on the passage of the PACT Act.

In summary, the criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 30, 2022, for the award of a 30 percent rating for IBS, hiatal hernia with esophageal spasticity and dyspepsia, have been met.  Therefore, an earlier effective date of August 30, 2022, is granted.  However, to the extent that the Veteran seeks an effective date prior to August 30, 2022, the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate 10 percent rating for tenosynovitis, left hand index finger

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate 10 percent rating for tenosynovitis, left hand long finger

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate 10 percent rating for tenosynovitis, right hand index finger

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate 10 percent rating for tenosynovitis, right hand long finger

7. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate noncompensable rating for tenosynovitis, left hand ring finger

8. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate noncompensable rating for tenosynovitis, left hand little finger

9. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate noncompensable rating for tenosynovitis, right hand ring finger

10. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of a separate noncompensable rating for tenosynovitis, right hand little finger

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of separate ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers.  As discussed in the introduction, the representative has argued that there was CUE in the April 2009 rating decision's failure to assign separate ratings.  However, the claim seeking revision of the April 2009 rating decision based on CUE is not for consideration at this time.  Neither the Veteran nor the representative has otherwise presented any particular argument as to why an earlier effective date is warranted or identified an earlier effective date that they believe is more appropriate.

The Veteran's October 2008 claim included a claim for entitlement to service connection for "tenosynovitis, bilateral (trigger fingers)".  In the April 2009 rating decision, the RO granted service connection and a noncompensable initial rating for "tenosynovitis of both long fingers (claimed as trigger fingers)".  The Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement as to the noncompensable initial rating in April 2010.  The July 2011 statement of the case continued the denial of a compensable initial rating for the disability.  The Veteran did not submit a timely substantive appeal following issuance of that statement of the case.  As such, he did not complete a timely appeal to the Board of the April 2009 rating decision's assignment of a noncompensable initial rating for tenosynovitis of the fingers.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.22, 19.52, 20.1103.  Therefore, the Veteran's October 2008 original claim for service connection may not serve as the basis for an earlier effective date for the award of separate ratings for the service-connected tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers.

No communication was received from the Veteran between issuance of the July 2011 statement of the case and receipt of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for an increased rating for tenosynovitis of the fingers.  Therefore, the earliest effective date available of the award of separate ratings for those disabilities is February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim.

As discussed above, for a higher rating to be granted during the one-year period prior to the claim, it must be factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during that period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  In this case, there is no evidence that dates during the one-year prior to the February 3, 2023, intent to file that documents the severity of the Veteran's tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers.  Therefore, it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in that disability occurred during that one-year period.  As such, the current effective date of February 3, 2023, is the earliest available date.

To the extent that the Veteran and his representative assert that the Veteran is entitled to effective dates based on his original October 2008 claim for service connection, the Board reiterates that the Veteran did not perfect an appeal to the Board of the April 2009 rating decision, which decided the Veteran's original claim for service connection.  As such, the October 2008 claim may not serve as a basis for earlier effective dates.

Furthermore, there is no basis in VA law for a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date for matters addressed in a final decision.  Rather, when a decision is final, only a request for a revision premised on CUE may result in the assignment of an earlier effective date based on the earlier claim.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).  Consequently, the Board concludes that any attempt to overcome the finality of the April 2009 rating decision by raising a freestanding claim for entitlement to earlier effective dates in conjunction with the current appeal must fail.  The Board's finding in this regard does not prejudice any future adjudication of the issue of CUE in the April 2009 rating decision.

In summary, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of separate ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeals is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeals.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeals must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

11. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  In the brief submitted along with the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the representative argues that the effective date should be no later than August 10, 2022, which is the effective date for the PACT Act.

In the May 2024 HLR decision, the RO explained that severance of service connection for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was proposed because the August 2023 rating decision contained CUE in establishing service connection for that disability.  The RO effectuated the proposed severance of service connection for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the September 2024 rating decision.

A retroactive increase or additional benefit will not be awarded after basic entitlement has been terminated, such as by severance of service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  Therefore, because service connection has been severed for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for that disability must be denied as a matter of law.

12. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis

13. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for chronic sinusitis

14. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for migraine headaches

15. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy

16. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 3, 2023, for the award of service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome

The Veteran seeks entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, migraine headaches, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.  As discussed above, the representative has argued that there was CUE in the April 2009 rating decision's failure to grant a separate rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy.  However, the claim seeking revision of the April 2009 rating decision based on CUE is not for consideration at this time.  Neither the Veteran nor the representative has otherwise presented any particular argument as to why earlier effective dates are warranted or identified earlier effective dates that they believe are more appropriate.

The Board finds that the earliest communication received from the Veteran that could reasonably be construed as a request for a determination of entitlement to, or that evidences a belief in entitlement to, service connection for rhinitis, sinusitis, headaches, right lower extremity radiculopathy, or left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome was received in February 2023 within one year of the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim for compensation.  Therefore, the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim serves as the basis for the effective date of the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, migraine headaches, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.

Specifically, the Veteran's October 2008 formal claim sought benefits for multiple disabilities, but did not seek benefits for a sinus disability, headaches, a neurological disability affecting the right lower extremity, or a left knee disability.  An October 2017 formal claim sought benefits for only for "cancer - thyroid".  Those formal claims were exclusive to the disabilities listed, and nothing in the claims or associated statements from the Veteran may reasonably be interpreted as a request for entitlement to, or a belief in entitlement to, service connection for a sinus disability such as allergic rhinitis or chronic sinusitis, for headaches, for a neurological disability of the right lower extremity such as radiculopathy, or for a left knee disability.  In addition, none of the Veteran's communications with VA prior to March 24, 2015, mention a sinus disability, headaches, a neurological disability affecting the right lower extremity, or a left knee disability in such a way that may be interpreted as an informal claim for service connection for those disabilities.

On February 3, 2023, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim.  On February 20, 2023, VA received the Veteran's formal claim for entitlement to service connection for a headache condition and for a bilateral knee condition, and entitlement to a higher rating for his service-connected back condition.  On February 22, 2023, VA received the Veteran's formal claim for entitlement to service connection for "allergic rhinitis and sinusitis".  Because those two formal claims were received within one year of the February 2023 intent to file a claim, the complete claims are to be considered as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

The RO established effective dates prior to February 3, 2023, for the awards of service connection for chronic sinusitis and for allergic rhinitis.  It assigned the effective date of August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for chronic sinusitis in the July 2023 rating decision based on the effective date for the PACT Act and the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 relating changes in law.  It explained in the May 2024 HLR decision that an even earlier effective date could not be assigned under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 relating to claims based on exposure to fine particulate matter and 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 because the evidence does not show that the disability manifested within 10 years of the Veteran's separation from active service.  It assigned the effective date of February 3, 2022, for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis in the May 2024 HLR decision based on the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114 and 3.320, explaining that the record does show that the disability manifested within 10 years of the Veteran's separation from active service.  The Veteran has not presented any arguments as to why even earlier effective dates may be warranted, and the Board finds no basis in the record for awarding even earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

To the extent that the Veteran and his representative assert that the Veteran is entitled to effective dates based on his October 2008 claims for service connection, as discussed above, those claims were denied in the final April 2009 rating decision and may not serve as a basis for earlier effective dates.  Also as discussed above, there is no basis in VA law for a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date for matters addressed in a final decision.  Rather, when a decision is final, only a request for a revision premised on CUE may result in the assignment of an earlier effective date based on the earlier claim.  See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. 296.  Consequently, the Board concludes that any attempt to overcome the finality of the April 2009 rating decision by raising a freestanding claim for entitlement to earlier effective dates in conjunction with the current appeal must fail.  The Board's finding in this regard does not prejudice any future adjudication of the issue of CUE in the April 2009 rating decision.

In summary, no communication was received from the Veteran prior to February 3, 2022, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis.  No communication was received from the Veteran prior to August 10, 2022, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis.  No communication was received from the Veteran prior to February 3, 2023, that may reasonably be interpreted as a claim for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, for right lower extremity radiculopathy, or for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.  Therefore, the criteria for entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, migraine headaches, right lower extremity radiculopathy, and left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome have not been met.  The evidence for and against the appeals for earlier effective dates is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeals.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeals must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Increased Ratings

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tenosynovitis, left hand index finger

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tenosynovitis, left hand long finger

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tenosynovitis, right hand index finger

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tenosynovitis, right hand long finger

5. Entitlement to a compensable rating for tenosynovitis, left hand ring finger

6. Entitlement to a compensable rating for tenosynovitis, left hand little finger

7. Entitlement to a compensable rating for tenosynovitis, right hand ring finger

8. Entitlement to a compensable rating for tenosynovitis, right hand little finger

The Veteran seeks an increased ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers.  The applicable review period is from February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes higher ratings are warranted.

The Veteran's tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers and long fingers is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5024-5229.  His tenosynovitis of the bilateral ring fingers and little fingers is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5024-5230.  The use of Diagnostic Codes 5024-5229 and 5024-5230 to rate the Veteran's service-connected tenosynovitis of the fingers reflects that the disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 5024 for tenosynovitis, tendinitis, tendinosis, or tendinopathy with reference to Diagnostic Code 5229 for limitation of motion of the index or long finger and Diagnostic Code 5230 for limitation of motion of the right or little finger.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

Diagnostic Code 5024 states that tenosynovitis is to be rated as degenerative arthritis based on limitation of motion of the affected parts.

Under Diagnostic Code 5229, a maximum rating of 10 percent is warranted for limitation of motion of the index or long finger with a gap of one inch (2.5 cm.) or more between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible, or; with extension limited by more than 30 degrees.

Under Diagnostic Code 5230, a maximum noncompensable rating is warranted for any limitation of motion of the ring or little finger.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Turning to the evidence for consideration, there is no evidence that dates during the one-year prior to the February 3, 2023, intent to file a claim that documents the severity of the Veteran's tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers.  Therefore, it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in those disabilities occurred during that one-year period, and ratings cannot be assigned during that period.

The medical treatment records and VA examinations show that the service-connected tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers has manifested in pain and/or limited motion in those fingers.  The Veteran has already been awarded the highest available schedular ratings for limitation of motion for each of his fingers, and those ratings contemplate all manifestations of the service-connected disabilities.  Therefore, there is no basis for awarding higher ratings for the service-connected tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers under Diagnostic Codes 5229 and 5230.

Specifically, the Veteran was afforded a VA hand and finger conditions examination in May 2023.  At that examination, the Veteran reported that he has recurrent catching in flexion of the fingers on both hands that he has treated with steroid injections.  He denied flare-ups in his symptoms.  On examination, the Veteran had painful, but normal range of motion in the right-hand and left-hand fingers both on initial testing and on repeated-use testing.  The Veteran did not have ankylosis in any of his finger joints.  The examiner opined that the Veteran would not have additional loss of motion in the fingers on repeated use over time.  As the Veteran has already been awarded the highest available schedular rating for limitation of motion for each of his fingers, and those ratings contemplate all manifestations of the service-connected disabilities, the May 2023 VA examination provides no basis for awarding higher ratings for the service-connected tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers under Diagnostic Codes 5229 and 5230.

The Board further finds that higher ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5216 through 5227 for ankylosis of the fingers is not warranted.  Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, surgical procedure."  Lewis v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 259 (1992) (citing Saunders Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing, and Allied Health at 68 (4th ed. 1987)).  An ankylosed joint is more commonly referred to as "frozen." See, e.g., Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 286 (32d ed.2012).  In this case, the record does not show that the Veteran's tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers manifested in actual ankylosis or that any finger could be considered frozen, immobile, or otherwise limited to an extent comparable to ankylosis.  Rather, the evidence shows that the Veteran maintained some level of mobility in the fingers throughout the review period, to include during periods of acute increased severity, such as on repeated use over time.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the ratings for the service-connected tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017).

In summary, the criteria for entitlement to higher ratings for tenosynovitis of the bilateral index fingers, long fingers, ring fingers, and little fingers have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the claims is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the claims.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

9. Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for chronic sinusitis

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for chronic sinusitis.  The applicable review period is from August 10, 2022, the effective date for the award of service connection for that disability, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a compensable initial rating is warranted.  The Board notes that the Veteran already has a separate 30 percent rating for his allergic rhinitis.  

The Veteran's chronic sinusitis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6512, which pertains to frontal chronic sinusitis, and the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis.  Under the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis, a noncompensable rating is warranted when sinusitis is detected by X-ray only.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when there are one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or; three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when there are three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or; more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or; when there is near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries.

A note following the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis defines an incapacitating episode of sinusitis as one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician.

The Veteran's medical treatment records for consideration show that in late August 2022 he reported a little congestion following having COVID a month prior, but that he was improving.  In February 2023, a CT of the sinuses showed no findings of sinusitis.  In March 2023, he reported a history of issues with nasal congestion for years.  On examination, he had boggy turbinates on the left, but good nasal airways bilaterally and no purulence.  The medical treatment records do not show that the Veteran required bed rest and treatment by a physician for his chronic sinusitis during the review period.  They also do not show that the Veteran reported or exhibited headaches, pain, or purulent discharge or crusting due to his chronic sinusitis during the review period.  As such, they do not show that the criteria for a compensable rating were met.

At a May 2023 VA sinusitis/rhinitis examination, the Veteran reported symptoms of nasal congestion, postnasal drip, and sinus tenderness and pain.  The examiner found that the Veteran had current sinusitis findings, signs, or symptoms of headaches and tenderness affecting the sinus with non-incapacitating episodes twice over the prior 12 months.  The examiner further indicated that the Veteran did not have incapacitating episodes of sinusitis in the prior 12 months and did not have a history of radical surgery or repeated sinus-related surgical procedures.  Thus, the VA examination shows that the Veteran had two non-incapacitating episodes of sinusitis over a one-year period, which does not meet the requirement for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6512 of at least three non-incapacitating episodes over a one-year period. As such, the May 2023 VA examination also does not show that the criteria for a compensable rating were met.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the rating for the service-connected chronic sinusitis, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, during the review period, the Veteran's chronic sinusitis did not manifest in incapacitating episodes requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment or in at least three non-incapacitating episodes per year.  The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to a compensable initial rating for chronic sinusitis have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

10. Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for migraine headaches

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for migraine headaches.  The applicable review period is from February 3, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection for that disability, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a compensable initial rating is warranted.

The Veteran's migraine headaches are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100, which pertains to migraines.  Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.   A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's headaches have been manifested by characteristic prostrating attacks less frequent than averaging one in 2 months over several months.

The medical treatment records do show that the Veteran complained of or sought treatment for his migraine headaches during the review period.  At a May 2023 VA headaches examination, the Veteran reported he has recurrent headache pain to the frontal sinus area when he has sinus symptoms.  He did not report any non-headache symptoms associated with his headaches, such as nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light or sound.  He indicated that his headaches typically last less than one day.  The examiner concluded that the records show that the Veteran does not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headache pain.  The Board affords that assessment probative value because it is consistent with the other evidence for consideration.  There is no indication in the evidence for consideration that the Veteran's headache pain caused extreme exhaustion or powerlessness at any time during the review period.

The Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, he has not described prostrating attacks.  Rather, he has described head pain with no related non-headache symptoms that last less than one day.  He has not described any accompanying powerlessness and exhaustion that would, for example, require him to lie down through part or all of the headache.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the initial rating for the service-connected migraine headaches, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, during the review period, the Veteran's migraine headaches were not manifested by characteristic prostrating attacks.  The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to a compensable initial rating for migraine headaches have not been met at any time during the review period.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

11. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.  The applicable review period is from February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a higher rating is warranted.

The Veteran's mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242, which pertains to degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome, and under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Formula). 

Under the General Formula, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 45 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

For VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching.  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Note 5 under Diagnostic Code 5242.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.  The Veteran's medical treatment records show that he reported low back pain that increased with walking.  However, they do not include range-of-motion measurements or other descriptions of the Veteran's mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine pertinent to the rating criteria during the review period.

At a May 2023 VA back conditions examination, the Veteran reported that that he had low back pain with prolonged sitting, standing, and walking, and when going from sitting to standing, bending over, lifting, carrying, squatting, ling supine, and going from supine to sitting.  He denied flare-ups in his low back symptoms.  On examination, he had 75 degrees of forward flexion and a combined range of motion of 210 degrees.  He did not have additional loss of motion following repetitive-use testing.  The examiner did not perform passive range-of-motion testing because such testing could not safely be performed without risking further injury to the Veteran.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran would have the same range of motion following repeated use over time or during flare-ups.  In addition, the Veteran did not have muscle atrophy, guarding, or muscle spasm.  The Veteran did have localized tenderness of the thoracolumbar spine, but it did not result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.  Such manifestations do not meet the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5242.  The Veteran did not have forward flexion of 60 degrees or less, a combined range of motion of 120 degrees or less, or muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  

There are no findings in the record to suggest that the Veteran's service-connected mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine manifested in ankylosis or that his spine was immobile, "frozen", or otherwise lacking in motion such that it manifested in the functional equivalent of ankylosis during that period.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities and the lay and medical evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with his service-connected mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the rating for the service-connected mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, during the review period, the Veteran's mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine did not manifest in ankylosis or its functional equivalent or in forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for mild degenerative changes of the lumbar spine have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the claim is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the claim.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

12. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.  The applicable review period is from February 3, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection for that disability, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a higher rating is warranted.

The Veteran's left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, which pertains to limitation of flexion of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees.

Also relevant to the Veteran's case is 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, which pertains to limitation of extension of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted for extension limited to 5 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 10 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 15 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 20 degrees.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 30 degrees.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 45 degrees.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher initial rating for the Veteran's service-connected left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome.  The Veteran's medical treatment records do not show any treatment for left knee symptoms during the review period, nor do they include any range-of-motion measurements for the left knee obtained during the review period.

At a May 2023 VA knee and lower leg conditions examination, the Veteran reported knee pain with walking, kneeling, and squatting.  He denied flare-ups in his left knee symptoms and denied a history of instability, recurrent subluxation, or frequent effusion of the left knee.  On initial testing, he had left knee flexion to 130 degrees and extension to 0 degrees.  He did not have additional loss of motion on repetitive-use testing.  He had full strength in both knees and no muscle atrophy.  He also had no joint instability on testing.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran would not have additional loss of function on repeated use over time or during flare-ups.  Such findings do not meet the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5260, or for a separate compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5261.  They do not indicate that the Veteran had left knee flexion limited to 45 degrees or less or extension limited to 10 degrees or greater.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the rating for the service-connected left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, during the review period, the Veteran's left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome manifested in painful motion that was not compensable under the relevant criteria for rating based on loss of motion.  The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

13. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ankle healed fracture with degenerative disease and chronic pain

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for right ankle healed fracture with degenerative disease and chronic pain.  The applicable review period is from February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a higher rating is warranted.

The Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, which pertains to limitation of motion of the ankle.  Under Diagnostic Code 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion).  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability.  The medical treatment records show that the Veteran had normal range of motion and strength without tenderness or swelling in the upper and lower extremities in November 2022.  A February 2023 VA treatment note states that the Veteran had decreased range of motion in the right ankle, but does not include specific range-of-motion measurements.  At a March 2023 VA podiatry consultation, the Veteran had pain-free range of motion of the right ankle with dorsiflexion to 10 degrees.  Such findings do not reflect marked limitation in the right ankle such that a higher rating was warranted under Diagnostic Code 5271.

At a May 2023 VA ankle conditions examination, the Veteran reported he had right ankle pain with walking and prolonged standing.  He denied flare-ups in his right ankle symptoms.  On examination, the Veteran had right ankle plantar flexion to 45 degrees and dorsiflexion to 20 degrees with pain on dorsiflexion.  He did not have additional loss of motion following repetitive-use testing.  He also had no ankylosis.  The examiner opined that the Veteran would not have additional loss of motion in the right ankle on repeated use over time or during flare-ups.  Thus, the Veteran did not have right ankle dorsiflexion limited to 5 degrees or less or plantar flexion limited to 10 degrees or less, nor did he have ankylosis in the right ankle at the time of the May 2023 VA examination.  In addition, he was able to achieve motion in the right ankle such that the ankle could not be considered "frozen", immobile, or otherwise limited to an extent comparable to ankylosis.  Accordingly, the May 2023 VA examination does not show that the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected right ankle disability were met under Diagnostic Code 5271.

The Board has considered whether any other diagnostic codes related to disabilities of the ankle would provide for a higher disability rating.  However, those other diagnostic codes are not applicable as there is no evidence of record indicating that the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability involves ankylosis of the subastragalar or tarsal joint, malunion of the os calcis or astragalus, or an astragalectomy.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5272, 5273, and 5274.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the rating for the service-connected right ankle disability, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, during the review period, the Veteran did not have marked limited motion of the right ankle.  The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ankle healed fracture with degenerative disease and chronic pain have not been met.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the claim is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the claim.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

14. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy

15. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for Guillain-Barre syndrome and numbness of left side of body, left lower extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks a higher initial rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy and a higher rating for Guillain-Barre syndrome and numbness of left side of body, left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The applicable review period for the right lower extremity is from February 3, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection for that disability, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The applicable review period for the Guillain-Barre syndrome and numbness of left side of body, left lower extremity radiculopathy, is from February 3, 2023, one year prior to receipt of the intent to file a claim, through July 13, 2023, the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subjected to higher-level review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Veteran has not presented any particular arguments as to why he believes a higher rating is warranted.

The Veteran's service-connected right and left lower extremity radiculopathy are currently rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520, which pertains to the paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  Under Diagnostic Code 8520, mild incomplete paralysis warrants a 10 percent rating.  Moderate incomplete paralysis warrants a 20 percent rating.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis warrants a 40 percent rating.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy warrants a 60 percent rating.  Complete paralysis, where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement is possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of knee is weakened or (very rarely) lost, warrants an 80 percent rating.

The sciatic nerve controls the functioning of the buttock, leg, knee, and muscles below the knee to the toes.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1257 (32d ed. 2012).

The words "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe", and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.  In addition, the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered but is not dispositive of the issue.  Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Although VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) is not binding on the Board, the standards provided in the M21-1 are relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims.  The Board must consider and address the relevant standards provided in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 17-18 (2021) (citing Healy v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312 (2021) and Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018)).  The M21-1 includes helpful descriptors of the different levels of severity set forth in the Schedule's ratings for diseases of the peripheral nerve.  In the absence of more clear definitions in the regulations, the Board will use the M21-1's descriptors as guidance in rating the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy L4-5, L5-S1.

The M21-1 provides that "mild" is the default evaluation assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment.  In general, the rater should look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.  A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

"Moderate" is the maximum evaluation available for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment and is characterized by symptoms described by the claimant and medically graded as significantly disabling and involving a larger area in the nerve distribution.  Other sign or symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

"Moderately severe" is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.  It is characterized by motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected.  In addition, atrophy may be present.

"Severe" is characterized by motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen in severe long-standing neuropathy cases.  Although severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than those for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs or symptoms that resemble some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.  Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

Turning to the relevant evidence for consideration, the medical treatment records show that the Veteran reported low back pain that radiates to his lower extremities.  However, they do not include descriptions of that pain, and they do not show that the Veteran had other symptoms, signs, or manifestations of his bilateral lower extremities radiculopathy, such as loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, or loss of sensation.

At a May 2023 VA peripheral nerves conditions examination, the Veteran reported that he had decreased sensation and motor function in his left lower extremity and fatiguing of the leg muscles with prolonged loading.  He also reported that he experienced mild intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness in the left lower extremity, but did not report any such symptoms in the right lower extremity.  On examination, he had 4 out of 5 strength in left ankle dorsiflexion, but otherwise had full 5 out of 5 strength in the bilateral lower extremities.  He had normal reflexes and no muscle atrophy in the lower extremities.  He had decreased sensation in the left lower leg/ankle and left/foot/toes, but otherwise had normal sensation in the lower extremities.  The examiner found that the Veteran's right sciatic nerve was normal, and that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic and femoral nerves.

Thus, the record shows that during the review period the Veteran reported or demonstrated pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness due to his service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve.  He also had some reduced strength in the left lower extremity at the May 2023 VA examination.  He also had decreased-but not absent-sensation in the left lower extremity at the May 2023 VA examination.  There is no indication in the record that the Veteran had any atrophy or trophic changes associated with his bilateral radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve.  Such findings are not inconsistent with and are generally supportive of the May 2023 VA examiner's assessment that, overall, the Veteran had no worse than mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerves.  In addition, the Veteran reported at the August 2023 VA examination that his symptoms were mild.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran had the sort of sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area and minimal motor abnormalities that are consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.  He did not have the significant sensory changes and motor changes of a lower degree consistent with the moderate level of severity.  As such, the Board finds that the medical treatment records and the May 2023 VA examination indicate that the Veteran's service-connected right and left lower extremity lower extremity radiculopathy resulted in no worse than mild incomplete paralysis, which warrants a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8520.

The May 2023 VA examination shows that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the left femoral nerve.  Because the femoral nerve is part of a nerve branch separate from the sciatic nerve branch, separate ratings may be awarded based on impairment of the sciatic nerve and the femoral nerve of the same lower extremity without improper pyramiding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1257 (32d ed. 2012).  Accordingly, the record supports the award of a separate 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8526 for mild incomplete paralysis of the left femoral nerve from February 3, 2023, the date that the Veteran's notice of intent to file a claim was received.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with regard to the ratings for the service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy, nor have any other such issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Yancy, 27 Vet. App. at 495; Doucette, 38 Vet. App. at 369-70.

In summary, the criteria for entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the femoral nerve have been met from February 3, 2023.  However, the Board therefore finds that the criteria for higher ratings for the service-connected radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities affecting the sciatic nerve have not been met.  Thus, to the extent that the Veteran seeks ratings in addition to or higher than those assigned herein and those assigned previously, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeals is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeals.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and, to that extent, the appeals must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

16. Entitlement to SMC based on housebound status prior to February 3, 2023

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for SMC based on housebound status prior to February 3, 2023.  The issue is part of the appeals for higher ratings and therefore has the same review period as those appeals.  Namely, the review period is from February 3, 2022, one year prior to receipt of the notice of intent to file a claim, through February 2, 2023, the day prior to the current effective date for the award of SMC based on housebound status.  In the brief submitted along with the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, the representative argues that the effective date should be no later than August 10, 2022, which is the effective date for the PACT Act.

Entitlement to SMC based on housebound status will be granted when a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and, (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  A veteran is permanently housebound when he is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his dwelling and the immediate premises.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

In this case, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent during the review period.  Furthermore, the Veteran does not contend, and the record does not show, that he was permanently housebound by reason of his service-connected disabilities at any time during the review period.  The Veteran's medical treatment records show that he had some difficulty with mobility and other functional impairment due to his service-connected disabilities; however, they show that he was able to travel outside of his home on a regular basis.

In summary, the Veteran did not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent during the review period and he is not considered to have been actually housebound.  Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence for and against the appeal is not in approximate balance, but rather weighs against the appeal.  Because there is not an approximate balance in the weight of the evidence, the doctrine of reasonable doubt is not for application, and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for malignant neoplasm of the thyroid is remanded.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypothyroidism is remanded.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for scar post anterior neck, surgery - thyroidectomy is remanded.

4. Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for malignant neoplasm of the thyroid is remanded.

5. Entitlement to a compensable initial rating for hypothyroidism is remanded.

6. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for scar post anterior neck, surgery - thyroidectomy, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for the award of service connection for malignant neoplasm of the thyroid and its related hypothyroidism and post-surgical scar.  He also seeks entitlement to higher initial ratings for those disabilities.  He submitted his original claim for entitlement to service connection for thyroid cancer in August 2017.  The RO denied that claim in an October 2017 rating decision.  In November 2017, the Veteran asked that the claim be reconsidered.  In January 2018, the RO issued a rating decision reconsidering-and again denying-the claim.  In January 2019, the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement as to the January 2018 rating decision.  The RO issued a statement of the case as to the issue on November 14, 2019.  The November 2019 statement of the case informed the Veteran that, to continue an appeal to the Board, he must submit a substantive appeal within 60 days from the date of the statement of the case or within the remainder, if any, of the one-year period from the date of the letter notifying him of the January 2018 rating decision.  On January 9, 2020, within 60 days of issuance of the November 2019 statement of the case, VA received from the Veteran a request for an extension of time for filing a substantive appeal, which sought an additional 30 days.  The Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS), which VA uses to track and control claims and appeals under the legacy system, indicates that the Veteran's appeal was closed in late January 2020 due to failure to respond to the November 2019 statement of the case.  The Veteran submitted a substantive appeal in February 2020.  There is no indication in the record that the RO considered the January 2020 request for an extension of time to file a substantive appeal or otherwise determined that the February 2020 substantive appeal was untimely.

An extension of the 60-day period for filing a substantive appeal may be granted for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be made prior to expiration of the time limit for filing the substantive appeal.  A denial of a request for extension may be appealed to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 19.53.

The appeals for earlier effective dates and increased initial ratings for the service-connected malignant neoplasm of the thyroid and its related hypothyroidism and post-surgical scar cannot be decided until the RO makes a decision as to the Veteran's January 2020 request for an extension of time for filing a substantive appeal, which was received in writing prior to the expiration of the time limit for filing a substantive appeal, and/or as to the timeliness of the February 2020 substantive appeal.  Therefore, the Board concludes that the issues must be remanded pending resolution of those issues.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (the Board may remand for correction of an error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Determine whether there is good cause to grant the Veteran's January 2020 request for an extension of time for filing a substantive appeal and, if necessary, whether the February 2020 substantive appeal was timely.
