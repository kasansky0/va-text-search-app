ORDER

Readjudication of service connection for hearing loss is not warranted.

FINDING OF FACT

Some of the evidence that became available following the February 2020 rating decision denying service connection for hearing loss is new, but it is not relevant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating service connection for hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 5104B, 5108, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.303, 3.2501, 20.203, 20.1103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1974 to August 1977.  This matter originated with an April 2024 rating decision which found there was no new and relevant evidence to warrant readjudication of his previously denied claim of service connection for hearing loss.  In timely appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), the Veteran requested the direct review docket.  

Given the procedural history of this matter, only the evidence of record as of the date notice of the rating decision was issued is for consideration by the Board herein.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.301.  Any evidence submitted thereafter cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like consideration of any such evidence, he may file a supplemental claim (following included instructions) and resubmit or identify it.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Readjudication

A prior decision will be readjudicated based on all the evidence of record if new and relevant evidenced is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5108(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501.  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  Relevant evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  Id.; 38 U.S.C. § 101(35).  In determining whether there is new and relevant evidence, reasonably identified VA treatment records and any evidence received after VA issued notice of the prior decision and while the evidentiary record was closed must be considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Hearing Loss

The Veteran's initial claim of service connection for hearing loss was denied in a February 2020 rating decision.  Two findings favorable to him were made therein.  First, he was found to have hearing loss as a current diagnosis.  Second, acoustic trauma during service was conceded based on his military occupational specialty of electrical power production specialist.  Relying on a VA medical opinion, however, it was determined that his hearing loss was not linked to his in-service acoustic trauma.  A nexus between them was not established, in other words.  The Veteran did not appeal within the one-year period he had to do so.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  He also did not seek higher-level review or submit a supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104B, 5108.  As such, the rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement with respect to the February 2020 rating decision.  He additionally submitted a statement, a few pages of VA treatment records, and some private treatment records.  More VA treatment records also were procured on his behalf.  Yet in late February 2024, he was informed his appeal would not be docketed because it was untimely.  Responding to this information, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in March 2024.  His same statement as before also was submitted along with it.  VA treatment records further once again were procured on his behalf.  After the April 2024 rating decision, more were added to the claims file.  Those dated during the period under consideration, to the extent they are not duplicates of those previously added, are deemed constructively received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii).

The aforementioned submitted and procured VA treatment records, collectively, are dated from 2017 to January 2024.  Only those from 2017 into December 2019 are listed among the evidence considered in the February 2020 rating decision.  It follows that those dated during this earlier window were part of the record previously and are duplicates, while those dated thereafter were not part of the record previously and are new.  Both the private treatment records and the statement also are new, since they also were not previously part of the record available for consideration when the February 2020 rating decision was issued.  However, none of this new evidence is relevant.  The private treatment records indeed concern the Veteran's skin problems.  They do not concern his hearing loss at all.

Next, the Veteran's statement contains his recollection that his separation examination during service was fast and not very thorough.  This recollection is presumed credible for purposes of reopening.  Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1992).  The statement continues with the Veteran's assessment that service treatment records seem to show his hearing improved during service and his declaration that this is nearly impossible.  It concludes with his belief that his high frequency hearing loss is consistent with his in-service acoustic trauma on the flight line.  As such, the statement presents argument about the weight to assign to service treatment records followed by a mere assertion that service connection is warranted.  It does not tend to prove or disprove the sole matter at issue, whether a link exists between his hearing loss and his in-service acoustic trauma.  

Whether such a link exists must be addressed in some manner for new evidence to qualify as relevant here.  The VA treatment records document the Veteran's hearing loss and his treatment for it.  This does not tend to prove or disprove a link between his hearing loss and his in-service acoustic trauma.  A November 2023 record also notes this trauma, but it is undisputed and thus not at issue.  The record finally includes the Veteran's recount that the start of his problems was 40 years prior.  This timing, which equates to about six years after service, does not tend to prove a link between his hearing loss and his in-service acoustic trauma.  Yet it alone also does not tend to disprove such a link, as service connection may be warranted regardless of when onset occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In considering whether readjudication is warranted, requiring that there be new and relevant evidence is a low bar.  It nevertheless is still a bar.  The evidence here, as set forth above, is new, but it is not relevant.  Nothing over and above that previously available has been submitted or procured with respect to a link between the Veteran's hearing loss and his in-service acoustic trauma, in other words.  The criteria for readjudication, in conclusion, have not been met.  Readjudication of service connection for hearing loss accordingly is not warranted.
