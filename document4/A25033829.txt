FINDING OF FACT

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. On March 19, 2025, the appellant submitted a written withdrawal that included her name, file number, and a statement that the appeal was withdrawn. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
