DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck was at least as likely as not the result of his conceded in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from May 1968 to June 1971, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.  He died in February 2021.  The appellant is his surviving spouse; she has been substituted for the Veteran to process the claims that were pending at the time of his death to completion.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2020 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2021, the appellant submitted a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested appellate review of the November 2020 rating decision via the Board's hearing docket.

In light of the full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal, it is being adjudicated in accordance with the Board's "One Touch" program.  The appellant appeared at a hearing before the undersigned in April 2025.  A transcript of the hearing will be obtained and associated with the claims file at a later date.

In accordance with the provisions of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board's review in this case is limited to evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in the decision on appeal, as well as evidence submitted by the Veteran and/or appellant, or his/her authorized representative, at the April 2025 hearing or within ninety days of the hearing; however, since a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal is warranted, the Board finds it unnecessary to delay adjudication of this appeal for the full ninety day evidence-submission window.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

Analysis

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding evidence is not in approximate balance, or nearly equal, when the evidence "persuasively favors one side or the other").

The record establishes the Veteran had the claimed tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck prior to his death.  The current disability element of the claim is not in dispute.  The claimed disability has been asserted to have resulted from the Veteran's presumed in-service exposure to herbicide agents in the Republic of Vietnam.  The November 2020 rating decision on appeal includes favorable findings regarding both the current disability and in-service incurrence elements of the claim on appeal.  The only issue that remains is the nexus element.

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted an opinion from one of his treating oncologist at the Veterans Health Administration that indicates the claimed tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck is at least as likely as not the result of his conceded herbicide agent exposure in light of his documented treatment history and cited research regarding the link between herbicide agents and the development of certain types of cancers.  Similarly, a November 2020 VA examiner also provided a favorable nexus opinion regarding the claim after reviewing the Veteran's claims file.  It appears the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim based solely on the fact that VA has not established a presumption of service connection for the claimed cancer despite the fact two experts provided favorable nexus opinions.  There is no reason to doubt the validity of the opinions that have been provided in this case; the Board finds them persuasive regarding the unestablished nexus element.

The Board notes the inapplicability of a presumptive provision does not foreclose the possibility of service connection on a direct basis, which appears warranted in this case.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-1044 (Fed.Cir.1994).  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant, the Board finds service connection for tongue cancer with involvement of the lymph nodes of the neck is warranted.  See Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014) ("By requiring only an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence' the Nation, 'in recognition of our debt to our veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding . . . benefits.").
