ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a thyroid condition is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left thigh/femur condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a gastrointestinal condition is remanded.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIN

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1985 to November 1992.

An initial rating decision was issued in January 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the January 2023 rating decision. In January 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision, which found that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In May 2024, the AOJ issued the Supplemental Claim decision on appeal.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for left thigh/femur condition and gastrointestinal condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board further notes that in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed additional issues that were decided by the AOJ in 2021 and 2016. The issue decided in 2021, an increased rating claim for back condition, was already pending before the Board in another AMA appeal (Docket No. 220610-248991) when he submitted the June 2024 VA Form 10182, and was decided by the Board in October 2024. The issue decided in 2016, an increased rating for left knee strain with instability, stems from unappealed rating action issued beyond the one-year period for appeal. As such, those issues are not addressed in this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, including psychosis, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). Generally, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). 

For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic." 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). When the disease identity is established, there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity. Id. Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. Id. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim. Id. Continuity of symptomatology is only applicable to those diseases recognized as chronic for VA purposes. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309.

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective indications of qualifying chronic disability, to include an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or at any time thereafter, and which by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1). Section 405 of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022), eliminated the manifestation period and the degree to which a qualifying chronic disability must manifest to be presumed as due to service in the Persian Gulf as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. The PACT Act is a liberalizing law which, in relevant part, provides for presumptive service connection for covered veterans. 38 U.S.C. § 1120(b).

A MUCMI is defined by a cluster of signs of symptoms, such as CFS, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases). 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(2)(B), 1118; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B)(1)-(3).

Under the PACT Act, a covered veteran is any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active service while assigned to a duty station in, including airspace above in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, or United Arab Emirates; or any veteran who, on or after September 11, 2001, performed active service while assigned to a duty station in, including airspace above in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Uzbekistan, or any other country determined relevant by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 1119.

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); see also Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992). Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he/she files his/her claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3rd 1391 (2021).

1. Thyroid

In the October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran noted he was seeking service connection for "Gulf War Unexplained Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness." He noted he was exposed to "slight radiation" while guarding the Pershing nuclear missile storage area, and that he had "mild exposure" to VX and GB chemicals while moving VX and GB artillery rounds during Operation Golden Python in 1990 in Germany. He stated he had thyroid, left thigh/femur, and gastrointestinal problems in 1993 due to such exposures.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current thyroid disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a thyroid disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Board initially notes that although the Veteran characterized his disability as a "Gulf War Unexplained Chronic Multi-Symptom Illness," he is not a Persian Gulf War veteran. His military personnel records show that he was stationed in Germany from March 1986 to March 1988, and from April 1989 to April 1992; they do not reveal any service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. The Veteran served during the Persian Gulf War, but he is not a Persian Gulf War veteran under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).

Turning to the records, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for any complaints of or treatment for a thyroid condition. His November 1992 separation Report of Medical Examination (RME) noted that his endocrine system was normal; he denied any thyroid trouble in the November 1992 separation Report of Medical History.

After service, his treatment records do not reveal a thyroid condition. Notably, an April 2002 VA record noted that the Veteran had no history of a thyroid disease; physical examination of the neck found no thyromegaly. A March 2013 VA record noted that he has not had thyromegaly, hyperthyroidism, or hypothyroidism; another March 2013 VA record noted that his thyroid test was within normal range. A December 2018 VA record noted that de did not have any thyromegaly. An August 2023 VA record noted there was no thyroid enlargement. A December 2013 VA record noted there was no thyromegaly.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran's claims file during or recent to the pendency of the claim does not reveal a diagnosis of a thyroid disability.

While the Veteran believes he has a current thyroid disability, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex as it requires medical training and knowledge, which he has not shown to possess. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

VA has not provided an examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his claimed thyroid disability. However, one was not required at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal per McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). McLendon provides that in disability compensation (service connection) claims, VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. The standards of McLendon were not met in this case, as there is no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability.

In addition, the Board is cognizant of the holding in Saunders, namely, that pain itself can constitute a disability. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Here, similarly to Saunders, the Veteran has demonstrated that any symptoms result in an impairment of earning capacity or other functional impairment. As such, Saunders is applicable to the case currently before the Board. 

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). There is no doubt to be resolved in this case. Entitlement to service connection for a thyroid condition is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Left Thigh/Femur Condition

In the October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran noted, "In 1993 (Gulf War Registry and bone scan revealed a malignant tumor left thigh)." He stated he had radiation exposure from securing nuclear missile storage area, and VX and GB exposure from moving VX and GB artillery rounds during Operation Golden Python. He did not specify the current left thigh/femur disability that he was seeking service connection for.

The AOJ found that the Veteran was diagnosed with benign small enchondroma, left distal femur, in April 2002. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Although the Veteran claims he was diagnosed with malignant tumor in left femur in 1993, the evidence of record does not reveal such diagnosis. A July 1997 VA record there was a small moderately intense abnormality in the distal left femur; it did not address any malignant tumor. An April 2002 VA x-ray report noted benign small enchondroma in the left distal femur. An October 2002 VA x-ray report noted that the enchondroma was shrinking in size, and that there was no sign of malignancy. A March 2013 VA record noted past history of enchondroma of the left femur, which was resolving. The claims file recent to the filing of the claim does not reveal further complaints of or treatment for the left femur enchondroma.

The Veteran's claims file indicates that he may be some other left femur diagnosis. A November 2018 VA CT of left lower extremity noted synovial herniation pits at the left femoral head/neck junction. A November 2018 VA bone densitometry noted normal total bone mineral density within the bilateral hips with decreased bilateral femoral neck bone mineral density, suggestive of osteopenia. An October 2022 VA record noted his recent illnesses included "osteopenia femurs." In a May 2023 VA record, his local history included "osteopenia."

Thus, it appears the Veteran had osteopenia in his left femur, and possibly synovial herniation pits in his left femoral head, during the pendency of the claim. As such, the first Shedden element is met.

The Board notes that it has taken an expansive view of the claim and evidence pursuant to Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), and recharacterized it accordingly as a claim for left thigh/femur condition.

Service connection for a disability due to radiation exposure can be demonstrated in one of three ways. First, 21 types of cancer are presumptively service-connected when the claimant is a "radiation-exposed veteran" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 1112(c) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(d). Second, 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b) provides a list of "radiogenic diseases" that are eligible for service connection provided that certain conditions are met. If a claim is based on a disease other than one specifically listed, VA must nevertheless consider the claim under these provisions if the claimant has cited or submitted competent scientific or medical evidence that the claimed condition is a radiogenic disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.311. Third, a direct service connection can be established. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The record does not reveal that the Veteran is a "radiation-exposed veteran" within the meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(d). Further, the left femur diagnosis noted above are not "radiogenic diseases" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311(b), and the Veteran has not cited or submitted competent scientific or medical evidence that his claimed condition is a radiogenic disease. As such, service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311 is unavailable, and referral to the Under Secretary for Benefits is not warranted. However, the Veteran still can be service-connected on a direct basis.

The record shows that an April 2024 letter from Army Dosimetry Center noted that there is no evidence that the Veteran was exposed to ionizing radiation in service. A May 2024 VA TERA memorandum noted that the Veteran did not participate in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). However, a review of the claims file indicates that the Veteran did participate in duties that placed him near nuclear missiles and VX and GB weapons.

A September 1989 Initial Nuclear Surety Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) Check-List noted that the Veteran had Secret or higher clearance, and that he has filed appropriate forms.

A DA Form 638-1 noted the Veteran's achievements from April 1989 to November 1990. It noted that he completed Tour of Duty at Waldheide Storage Area Camp Redleg, protecting Pershing II missile systems; he completed Tour of Duty at Miesau Army Depot, protecting U.S. Army Chemical Munitions Retrograde; and that he Participated in 4-9 FA Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) mission exercises and physical security inspections.

An August 1990 certificate from 56th Field Artillery Command commended the Veteran for meritorious service as an infantryman and a member of task force 4-9 FA. It noted that his motivation, personal sacrifice, and professionalism contributed greatly to task force 4-9's critical mission of nuclear security.

An October 1990 record shows the Veteran participated in Operation Steel Box - Europe Chemical Weapons Retrograde, and that his performance in guarding U.S. Chemical Munitions Retrograde contributed directly to the success of that mission.

An October 1990 Department of the Army letter noted the this letter is being accorded to the Veteran in recognition of the high standards he has been forced to meet while serving in the 2nd Infantry Battalion, 56th Field Artillery Command (Pershing). It noted that "It should be noted that while serving in this command you were entrusted with the task of safeguarding Nuclear and Chemical weapons" and participated in "critical mission of nuclear security."

A certificate from 59th Ordnance Brigade noted that the Veteran participated in Operation Golden Python or Steel Box from June 1990 to September 1990 at chemical weapons retrograde in the Federal Republic of Germany. He was commended for secure removal of 155-millimeter and 8-inch VX and GB artillery rounds from the Federal Republic of Germany.

A service treatment record that was associated with the claims file on October 26, 1993 shows a photograph of the Veteran's unit, and a handwritten page with the following:

"Operation Golden Python" Chemical Weapons Retrograde June 1990-September 1990[.] Removal of leaky 155mm 8 inch VX and GB Artillery Rounds from Federal Republic of Germany[.] Co. C 2/4 Inf.

In the October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran noted that during Operation Golden Python, "a container was dropped a cleanup crew came to clean up the mess."

Given the foregoing, resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the Veteran was exposed to radiation during active service. The evidence indicates that he participated in security of nuclear missiles since around April 1989 to November 1990, and that he was "entrusted with the task of safeguarding Nuclear and Chemical weapons." While the Veteran's service treatment records and military personnel records does not clearly indicate his exposure to radiation, the records above demonstrate that his duties concerned security of nuclear weapons sinc around September 1989. Accordingly, although the extent to which the Veteran was exposed to radiation is not known, the Board finds credible the evidence showing that the Veteran was in close proximity to nuclear weapons and was exposed to some level of radiation for about a year and a half from September 1989 to November 1992.

The Board also resolves all reasonable doubt in his favor and finds that he was exposed to VX and GB chemicals in service. The DA Form 638-1 noted he completed Tour of Duty at Miesau Army Depot, Protecting U.S. Army Chemical Munitions Retrograde. The certificate from 59th Ordnance Brigade noted that he participated in Operation Golden Python from June 1990 to September 1990 at chemical weapons retrograde in the Federal Republic of Germany, and was commended for secure removal of 155-millimeter and 8-inch VX and GB artillery rounds. The October 1993 record noted that he participated in the removal of "leaky 155mm 8 inch VX and GB Artillery Rounds." A simple internet search shows that in Operation Steel Box, about 100,000 sarin and VX filled chemical munitions were moved from West Germany to Johnston Atoll for destruction. See End of United States Development of Chemical Warfare (1980-Present), https://www.denix.osd.mil/rcwmprogram/history/ (accessed April 9, 2025). The Veteran also noted in the Form 21-526EZ that during Operation Golden Python, a container was dropped and a cleanup crew came to clean up the mess. Considering his participation in the removal of 100,000 VX and GB artillery rounds, some of which were leaky," resolving any reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that he was exposed VX and GB in service.

The evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal indicates that the Veteran had a left femur disability and in-service exposure to radiation and VX and GB chemicals, and he has asserted that his left thigh/femur condition is related to such exposures. There was insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. Thus, a VA examination was warranted at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 79. The AOJ's failure to provide a VA examination constituted pre-decisional duty to assist error. On remand, a VA examination should be provided to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left thigh/femur disability. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

2. Gastrointestinal Condition

The Veteran stated that due to his exposure to radiation from guarding nuclear missiles and VX and GB from moving artillery rounds, he had gastrointestinal problems in 1993; he did not specify the current gastrointestinal disability he was seeking service connection for. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of esophagitis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

A review of the claims file shows that the Veteran had additional gastrointestinal disorders during the pendency of the claim. Notably, an August 2023 VA record shows the Veteran has gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); a December 2023 VA record shows the Veteran has pancreatitis and common bile duct (CBD) stricture. The Board has taken an expansive view of the claim and evidence pursuant to Clemons, and recharacterized the claim as service connection for gastrointestinal condition.

As discussed above, the evidence indicates that the Veteran was exposed to some level of radiation and VX and GB chemicals in service. The diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders are not radiogenic diseases, and referral to the Under Secretary for Benefits is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.311.

However, given the Veteran's gastrointestinal disorders, in-service exposure to radiation and VX and GB chemicals, his assertion that his gastrointestinal condition is related to such exposure, and insufficient competent medical opinion to adjudicate the claim, a VA examination was warranted at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 79. Failure to provide a VA examination constituted a pre-decisional duty to assist error that warrants a remand. Accordingly, a VA examination has to be provided to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's current gastrointestinal disorders.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule VA examinations to determine the nature and likely etiology of the Veteran's left thigh/femur and gastrointestinal conditions. The examiner should review the claims file, including this Remand, prior to responding to the following:

(a)	Identify the Veteran's left thigh/femur and gastrointestinal disorders present during the pendency of the appeal (since around October 2022).

(b)	The examiner should opine whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left thigh/femur disability and gastrointestinal disability are related to service, to include in-service exposure to nuclear radiation and VX and GB chemicals.

In providing a response to the above question, the examiner is asked to consider and address the Veteran's exposure to:

(1)	radiation from nuclear missiles while guarding them for about a year and a half; and

(2)	VX and GB chemicals while participating in secure removal of 100,000 VX and GB artillery rounds, some of which were "leaky," during Operation Golden Python (a.k.a. Operation Steel Box)

The examiner is reminded that an opinion addressing direct service connection is required. A rationale that finds that the disability is not presumptive as per regulations will not be found adequate.

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed. If an opinion cannot be offered without resort to mere speculation, the examiner must indicate why this is the case and what additional evidence, if any, would allow for a more definitive opinion.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
