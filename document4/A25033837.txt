FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for conjunctivitis on October 20, 2020.

2. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for a mental condition on November 5, 2020.

3. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for a skin condition on October 20, 2020.  

4. The conjunctivitis disability is active.  However, it does not result in corrected distance visual acuity of at least 20/70 in one eye and 20/50 in the other eye, a visual field defect, impairment of muscle function, disfigurement under Diagnostic Code 7800, or at least three incapacitating episodes that required treatment for conjunctivitis within a twelve-month period.  

5. The PTSD disability was manifested as occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas for the period prior to April 26, 2023.  Total social and occupational impairment was not shown.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2007 to September 2011.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2023, December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The claim for service connection for a back disability was denied in an April 2022 rating decision and the claim for service connection for PTSD was denied in a September 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) challenging those decisions in December 2022.  The HLR was adjudicated by the February 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of April 14, 2022 with respect to the back disability and as of September 6, 2022 with respect to PTSD-the respective dates of the rating decisions adjudicated by the February 2023 HLR rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after April 14, 2022 with respect to the back disability and after September 6, 2022 with respect to PTSD, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The claim for conjunctivitis was adjudicated in a December 2023 rating decision.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option in the Notice of Disagreement, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as to conjunctivitis as of December 13, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after December 13, 2023 with respect to conjunctivitis, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The claims for eczema and urticaria were adjudicated in a January 2024 rating decision.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option in the Notice of Disagreement, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as to eczema and urticaria as of January 27, 2024-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Earlier Effective Dates 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Additionally, if a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an intent to file a claim, the date of claim for effective date purpose is the date the intent to file was received, except for supplemental claims under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).

As noted by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Calhoun v. McDonough, a continuously pursued claim under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeal system is not final, thus allowing for an effective date of an award as early as the date of the first claim in a continuously pursued claim. Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024).  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h), if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing any available review option within 1 year of the issuance of a prior decision, the effective date of any award is to be fixed in accordance with (1) the date of receipt of the initial claim, or (2) the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, as the effective date for the award of service connection. 

The Veteran challenges the effective dates for service connection for conjunctivitis, PTSD and the skin conditions.  See February 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  As explained herein, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is warranted for the conjunctivitis claim but denies the claims for earlier effective dates for PTSD and the skin conditions.

Conjunctivitis  

VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for conjunctivitis on October 20, 2020.  The claim was denied in a February 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) challenging the February 2021 rating decision in February 2021, resulting in an April 2021 rating decision that continued the denial.  In August 2021, within a year of the April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, seeking service connection for conjunctivitis.  The RO continued the denial in a September 2022 rating decision.  In February 2023, the Veteran submitted an HLR request challenging the September 2022 denial.  The RO determined that a duty to assist error had occurred and ordered a VA examination for the Veteran's conjunctivitis claim.  The April 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with conjunctivitis in 2007 and opined that the condition was a result of her toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  The RO thereafter granted service connection for conjunctivitis in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal and assigned August 10, 2022 as the effective date.  

The record reflects that the Veteran developed conjunctivitis prior to the October 20, 2020 claim for compensation and that she continuously pursued that claim until it was granted in the December 2023 rating decision.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that October 20, 2020 is the appropriate effective date for service connection for conjunctivitis and the claim is granted to that extent.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(b)(2), 3.2500(h).  

PTSD

Although the Veteran challenged the effective date for service connection as part of the Notice of Disagreement, the record reflects that November 5, 2020 is the appropriate date.  VA received the Veteran's claim for a mental condition on that date and the Veteran continuously prosecuted the claim until it was granted in the September 2022 rating decision.  The record does not reflect receipt of an intent to file within a year of the November 5, 2020 claim.  Rather, the most recent intent to file was submitted in September 2019, more than a year prior to the November 5, 2020 claim.  Also, an initial claim for service connection on a VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit from a prior rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).   The Board thus concludes that November 5, 2020 is the appropriate effective date for service connection for PTSD, and the claim is denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(b)(2), 3.2500(h).  

Eczema and Urticaria

Although service connection for eczema and urticaria was initially assigned as of August 10, 2022, the January 2024 rating decision on appeal determined that clear and unmistakable error had occurred in the assignment of the effective date.  The RO assigned October 20, 2020 as the effective date for service connection for eczema and urticaria.  That is the date VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) for a skin condition.  The record does not reflect receipt of an intent to file within a year of the October 20, 2020 claim.  Rather, the most recent intent to file was submitted in September 2019, more than a year prior to the October 20, 2020 claim.  Also, an initial claim for service connection on a VA Form 21-526EZ cannot establish continuous pursuit from a prior rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).   The Board thus concludes that October 20, 2020 is the appropriate effective date for service connection for eczema and urticaria and the claim is denied.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(b)(2), 3.2500(h).  

Increased Ratings

Generally, disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation, as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question of which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  Id.  Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Where the appellant has expressed dissatisfaction with the assignment of a rating, separate, or "staged," ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.   Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Conjunctivitis

The Veteran has an initial 10 percent rating for conjunctivitis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6018.  Under that code, an "active" disease process is rated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye (i.e., by visual impairment or by incapacitating episodes), with a minimum rating of 10 percent assigned.  For an "inactive" disease process, evaluate based on residuals, such as visual impairment and disfigurement (DC 7800).  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate on the basis of either visual impairment due to a particular condition or incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.  An incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes, such as systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents, intravitreal or periocular injections, laser treatments, or other surgical interventions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79 at Notes 1 and 2.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for evidence of documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least three but less than five treatments for an eye condition during the past twelve months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Visual impairment, which is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function.  38 C.F.R. § 4.75(a).  Under Diagnostic Code 6066 for visual acuity, a 20 percent rating is warranted when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40; or when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2023.  The corrected distance visual acuity of both eyes was reported as 20/20.  The Veteran did not have anatomical loss of an eye, scarring, disfigurement or diplopia.  No visual field defect was found.  The examiner noted that the conjunctivitis was active with no incapacitating episodes attributable to any eye condition over the past 12 months.  

Based on review of the competent evidence of record, the Veteran had active conjunctivitis throughout the claim period with corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes and no evidence of incapacitating episodes or disfigurement related to the disability.  Accordingly, the 10 percent minimum rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6018 is appropriate and there is no basis for a higher rating under Codes 6000 or 7800.  

To the extent the Veteran asserts her disability warrants a higher rating, the Board recognizes the Veteran is competent and credible to describe the observable symptoms of the disability.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the record does not reflect that she is competent to state that the disability warrants a higher rating because such an opinion requires medical expertise and knowledge that she has not been shown to possess.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

PTSD

The Veteran has an initial 70 percent rating for PTSD, staged to 100 percent effective April 26, 2023 pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  The assignment of the 100 percent disability rating occurred in an April 2024 rating decision and the Board, as a subsequent adjudicator, is bound by this finding in the absence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As the assignment of the 100 percent rating represents the maximum rating available under Diagnostic Code 9411, the staged rating represents a full grant of benefits for the period from April 26, 2023.  The availability of a rating in excess of 70 percent prior to April 26, 2023 remains before the Board.  

The General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, Diagnostic Code 9411, provides a 70 percent rating for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as:  gross impairment in thought process or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance or minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  See id.  

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations for PTSD in January 2021 and January 2022.  Both examiners indicated that the PTSD was productive of reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran reported at both examinations that she had healthy relationships with her parents and siblings, that she got along with her spouse but that she had did not have close friends because of her trust issues and inability to get close to people.  The Veteran reported a spotty employment record due to anxiety, noting that she had left employment with a retail store due to anxiety attacks and had to leave her current job at a medical center at times due to panic attacks.  The January 2021 examiner listed the Veteran's symptoms as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting. The January 2022 examiner listed the same symptoms, with the addition of flattened affect.  

The examiners generally described the Veteran as well-groomed and appropriately dressed, cooperative, anxious and tearful at times.  The Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.  The examiners reported that the Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres, that her insight and judgment appeared intact and that there was no evidence of perceptual disturbances, paranoia or delusional thinking.

Although the Veteran was also afforded a VA examination for PTSD in April 2023, that evidence is not within the evidentiary window and will not be considered on this appeal.  

VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran was treated for symptoms of depression and anxiety.  The Veteran engaged the crisis hotline in January 2021 requesting mental health services, indicating that she struggled with mild depression in the past and needed someone to talk to.  During the January 2021 initial assessment, the Veteran endorsed moderately severe symptoms of depression and severe symptoms of anxiety.  During a January 2022 mental health encounter, the Veteran endorsed symptoms related to intrusions, avoidance, alterations in cognitions and mood, isolation, instability and hypervigilance.  The treatment provider reported that the Veteran was cooperative and coherent with logical thought processes, self-aware insight and judgment.  The Veteran denied suicidal ideation.  

The Veteran reported in a December 2020 statement that she had difficulty forming close relationships with others and was overprotective.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the PTSD symptoms were productive of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas during the period on appeal but did not rise to the level of total occupation and social impairment.  The Veteran was employed, described healthy relationships with her family of origin and an "ok" relationship with her spouse.  The examiners and treatment providers generally described the Veteran as cooperative and appropriately groomed with no evidence of delusions.  Although the Veteran's symptoms interfered with her employment and relationships, there is insufficient evidence that they caused total occupational or social impairment. The record also demonstrates that during the period on appeal, the Veteran did not display symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, a persistent danger to herself or others, or disorientation to time or place.  Rather, the Veteran was noted to have intact though processes with judgment and insight within normal limits and she regularly denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.  The Board thus finds that the record is not indicative of total occupational and social impairment during the period prior to April 26, 2023 so as to warrant the assignment of a 100 percent rating.  Accordingly, the claim for an increased rating is denied.  

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Lastly, to the extent that the Veteran's claim for PTSD raises the issue of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), that issue is the subject of a separate appeal pending at the Board and will be addressed on the merits in a later Board decision.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The claims for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for eczema and an initial compensable disability rating for urticaria are remanded.

The Veteran is assigned an initial 10 percent rating for eczema and an initial noncompensable rating for urticaria.  Following review of the competent medical and lay evidence of record, the Board concludes that the VA examinations on which the ratings are based are inadequate, requiring remand.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate).  Specifically, the November 2020 and April 2023 VA examinations for skin contain apparent contradictions and do not adequately account for the treatment undergone by the Veteran.  

The November 2020 examiner described the location of the urticaria condition as "generalized all of the body" and the location of eczema on the bilateral upper arms.  The examiner also reported that there were no visible characteristic lesions of urticaria at the time of the examination, and reported no total body area or exposed area was affected.  The eczema condition was described as different phases of healing rashes, dryness, bumps, fissures, peeling or redness on the bilateral upper arms.  Eczema was noted to affect 5 to 20 percent of the total body area.  The examiner also reported, however, that the combined total body area affected by the conditions was 20 to 40 percent and that the combined total exposed area affected by the conditions was none.  The examiner did not explain the apparent contradiction regarding the total body area affected by the conditions.  

The April 2023 VA examiner reported that the eczema affected 5 to 20 percent of the total body area but did not address the area affected by urticaria.  The examiner reported that the combined percentage of the multiple skin conditions found affecting the total body was 5 percent.  The April 2023 examiner also reported that the conditions were treated with topical medication.  VA treatment records, however, reflect that the Veteran was also treated with phototherapy in May 2021, July 2021 and September 2021.  

The Board concludes that the contradictory responses of the VA examiners regarding the total body area affected by the conditions and the failure to recognize the phototherapy treatment renders the November 2020 and April 2023 VA examinations inadequate for rating purposes.  Accurate reports of the percentage of the total body areas affected and the treatment for the Veteran's skin conditions are required for assigment of the appropriate rating under the General Skin Formula.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  The failure to obtain adequate VA examinations is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand.  

Service connection for a thoracolumbar spine condition is remanded.

The Board is bound by the finding in the February 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a disability based on the diagnosed condition of lumbosacral strain.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  VA treatment records document the Veteran's complaint of and treatment for low back pain.  Although a VA examiner offered a negative direct service nexus opinion, the Veteran contends that the back condition is related to the service-connected PTSD.  See December 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  The Veteran refers to VA treatment notes documenting a possible relationship between the back condition and her mental health symptoms.  Physical therapy notes in April and June 2021 noted chronic low back pain with neural tension and prior medical history significant for anxiety and depression.  An April 2021 x-ray documented no acute findings or significant degenerative changes.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the failure to obtain an opinion considering whether the back disability is secondarily related to PTSD constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination addressing the nature and severity of the eczema and urticaria disabilities.  The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner and all necessary tests should be performed, and the results reported.  All symptomatology should be reported.  

The examiner should specifically address the evidence of phototherapy treatment.  

The examiner should also specifically address the combined total area and exposed areas affected by the conditions separately and in combination.  

2. Obtain a VA medical opinion addressing the nature and etiology of the back disability.  The Veteran's claims file, including a copy of this remand, should be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. If the examiner determines that a physical examination is warranted, one should be scheduled.  Following review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, if any, the examiner should address:  

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal) that the back disability was proximately caused by the service-connected PTSD disability.  

(b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the back disability was aggravated (worsened beyond natural progression) by the service-connected PTSD disability.   In proffering the opinion on aggravation, the examiner must address whether the was any incremental increase, even transient.  Aggravation does not require permanency.

The examiner should consider and address the physical therapy notes from April and June 2021 addressing the Veteran's back pain and mental health symptoms.  

In rendering these opinions, the reviewing clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report her symptoms and history.  Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  

The reviewing clinician is not to improperly discount the Veteran's lay statements or mistakenly rely on an absence of medical evidence in the record to support his or her conclusions.  

All findings and conclusions should be supported with a complete rationale based on consideration of the medical and lay evidence of records.  If it is not possible to provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the reason that is so should be explained, indicating whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided or whether the inability to provide an opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge in general or of the examiner.  If the inability to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation is due to a deficiency in the record (additional facts required), the RO should develop the claim to the extent necessary to cure any such deficiency.  If the inability to provide an opinion is due to the examiner's lack of requisite knowledge or training, the RO should obtain an opinion from a medical professional who has the knowledge and training needed to render such an opinion.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
