DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

An effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder (hereinafter, PTSD) is denied.

An effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected PTSD is denied.

An effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. It is not factually ascertainable that PTSD increased in severity so as to warrant the assignment of a higher rating prior to June 4, 2021.

2. It is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran became unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due solely to his service-connected PTSD prior to June 4, 2021.

3. Prior to June 4, 2021, the Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling, to include on the basis of individual unemployability; nor is he shown to have been permanently housebound as a result of his service-connected disabilities during that time.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a TDIU due to service-connected PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.3, 4.16.

3. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1980 to September 2003.  His decorations include the Southwest Asia Service Medal and the Kuwait Liberation Medal.

This matter arises from a January 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. Following a further decision on Higher-Level Review in November 2022, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in November 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).  

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 AOJ rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claims.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than June 4, 2021, for the award of a 70 percent evaluation for PTSD.  Specifically, the Veteran, through his representative, has asserted that he should have been assigned an effective date of July 1, 2018.  See November 2023 Attorney Brief.

Relevant law provides that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.400(b)(2).  The effective date for an increased rating will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in the legacy system on July 1, 2018.  See July 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In November 2018, the AOJ denied the claim.  In March 2019, the Veteran filed a legacy NOD (VA Form 21-0958), and the AOJ issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in April 2020.

On April 28, 2020, VA received the Veteran's initial VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review), electing to withdraw his legacy appeal and opt into the modernized review system under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Subsequent correspondence noted that the Veteran's legacy appeal was, in fact, withdrawn.  See May 2020 Correspondence.

In September 2020, a rating decision was issued that denied service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder (claimed as PTSD).  In December 2020, VA received VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) seeking service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  Following additional development, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD in a May 2021 rating decision and assigned a 50 percent rating therefor, effective April 20, 2021.

The Veteran submitted an additional VA Form 20-0996 in May 2021.  He also filed a VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability) in June 2021.  In a rating decision dated in August 2021, the AOJ adjudicated the May 2021 request for Higher-Level Review and granted an effective date of July 1, 2018, for the award of service connection and a 50 percent rating for PTSD.

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0995.  In a January 2022 rating decision, the AOJ increased the rating for the Veteran's PTSD to 70 percent, effective June 4, 2021, the date of receipt of his VA Form 21-8940.  The AOJ also awarded a TDIU due to his combined service-connected disabilities, effective July 1, 2018.

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0996 requesting review of the January 2022 rating decision.  In a Higher-Level Review decision dated in November 2022, the AOJ denied an earlier effective date for the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD.  The AOJ also awarded a TDIU based solely on the Veteran's PTSD, as well as SMC at the housebound rate, effective June 4, 2021.  Thereafter, as noted above, the Veteran appealed the effective dates to the Board.

The Veteran's PTSD is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. That diagnostic code utilizes the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Codes 9201-9440.  Under the General Rating Formula, a 70 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech that is intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

Turning to the medical evidence, an April 2019 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran presented with improved chronic mood symptoms.  He was not a danger to himself and did not desire other services.  A November 2019 review of systems noted that the Veteran denied depression, anxiety, memory loss, suicidal/homicidal ideation, and hallucinations.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2020.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decreased work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms that were controlled by medication.  The examiner indicated that current symptoms included anxiety.  On behavioral observation, the Veteran was oriented to person, place, date, and situation; he was cooperative with fair hygiene; his recent and remote memory was intact; his psychomotor functioning was within normal limits; his thought content was appropriate; there was no evidence of delusional thinking, and he did not appear to be responding to internal stimuli; and he denied suicidal ideation.

An April 2020 treatment record notes that the Veteran answered questions appropriately and was emotionally labile.  He had no identified psychosocial safety precautions at that time.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in April 2021.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  The examiner indicated that current symptoms included depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; flattened affect; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation or mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  On mental status examination, the Veteran denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, perceptual disturbances, hallucinations, and delusions.

In October 2021, a VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  The examiner indicated that current symptoms included depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occurred weekly or less often; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss; circumstantial, circumlocutory or stereotyped speech; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; disturbances of motivation or mood; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work and a work-like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; impaired impulse control; and neglect of personal appearance.  

Following review of the evidence, the Board must find that the Veteran did not meet or more nearly approximate the criteria for a rating in excess of 50 percent for his service-connected PTSD prior to June 4, 2021; that is, he did not exhibit symptomatology reflective of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.  

As noted, a VA examination conducted in March 2020 found that the Veteran's disability was manifested by symptoms of anxiety.  Mental status examination reflected that he was alert and oriented; no psychomotor activity was present; and he denied delusional thinking.  Similarly, a VA examination in April 2021 noted that his thought content was coherent and linear; he denied hallucinations and delusions; and he denied suicidal or homicidal ideation.  The Board also notes that VA treatment records, outlined above, reflect that the Veteran was not a danger to himself, showed improved symptoms, and denied depression, anxiety, memory loss, suicidal/homicidal ideation, and hallucinations.  Nothing in these records documents occupational and social impairment to the extent necessary for a 70 percent rating.  To the contrary, the evidence of record first shows an increase in severity of the Veteran's PTSD at the time of the October 2021 VA examination.  That said, the Board will not disturb the more favorable June 4, 2021, effective date assigned by the AOJ.

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD prior to June 4, 2021.  As such, the benefit-of-the doubt doctrine is inapplicable.  The appeal of this issue must be denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of a TDIU due to service-connected PTSD

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 4, 2021, for the award of SMC at the housebound rate

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than June 4, 2021, for the award of a TDIU due to a single service-connected disability.  Specifically, the Veteran, through his representative, has asserted that he should have been assigned an effective date of July 1, 2018, for a TDIU based on PTSD alone, as well as for SMC at the housebound rate.  See November 2023 Attorney Brief.

By way of background, the Veteran filed a formal claim for a TDIU on June 4, 2021.  In a January 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted a TDIU, noting that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to a combination of his service-connected disabilities.  Subsequently, a November 2022 rating decision found that a TDIU was warranted based solely on the Veteran's PTSD for the period beginning June 4, 2021, and that he was entitled to SMC at the housebound rate from that date as well.  At present, the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU based on a single disability and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), both effective June 4, 2021.

A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation.  As such, the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to TDIU claims.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).  Generally, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  The effective date "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

An exception to that rule applies only under circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of the claim for increased compensation.  If an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of receipt of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2).

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  A total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  A total disability may or may not be permanent.  Total ratings will not be assigned, generally, for temporary exacerbations or acute infectious diseases except where specifically prescribed by the schedule.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a).

A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, where it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation as a result of a service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more or as a result of two or more disabilities, providing at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.16(a).

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU, effective from July 1, 2018 (the entire period on appeal), based on the combined effect of all of his service-connected disabilities.  For the appeal period prior to June 4, 2021, the Veteran was service connected for PTSD, evaluated as 50 percent disabling from July 1, 2018; gastroesophageal reflux disease, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from October 1, 2003; sinusitis, evaluated as 0 (zero) percent disabling from October 1, 2003, and 10 percent disabling from July 1, 2018; lumbosacral strain, evaluated as 0 percent disabling from October 1, 2003, and 20 percent disabling from July 1, 2018; allergic rhinitis, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from October 1, 2003, and 30 percent disabling from July 1, 2018; and an appendectomy scar and right hand scar, each evaluated at 0 percent from October 1, 2003.  His combined rating is 80 percent from July 1, 2018.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled.  Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994).  Thus, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is generally no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for a TDIU moot where a 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

That said, an award of a 100 percent schedular rating does not always render the issue of entitlement to a TDIU moot.  VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities entitle him to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) (at the "housebound rate").  Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  Specifically, SMC may be warranted if, in part, a Veteran has a 100 percent disability rating for a "single disability," and a TDIU based on a single disability may satisfy that requirement.  See Bradley, 22Vet. App.at 292 (analyzing 38 U.S.C.§ 1114(s)); Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991).

In addressing the merits of the claim, the Board notes that unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances."  Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 452. Therefore, in adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must take into account the individual Veteran's education, training, and work history.  Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering Veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering Veteran's eighth grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering Veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019), the Court provided a list of potentially relevant factors to be considered in determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  Pertinent to the Veteran's PTSD, the Court indicated that a decision on TDIU should address whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Factors that may be relevant include, but are not limited to, limitations, if any, concerning memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity.

On his TDIU application, the Veteran reported that his service-connected disabilities prevented him from following a substantially gainful occupation.  He reported completing high school and that he last worked full-time in 2011 as a technician.

As noted above, a March 2020 examiner indicated that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decreased work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or by symptoms that were controlled by medication.  At that time, the examiner noted that the Veteran had not worked since 2011, but had obtained an associate degree in 2017.  The examiner indicated that his then-current symptoms included anxiety.

During an April 2021 examination, the Veteran reported that he retired in 2011.  He stated that he had some difficulty getting along with others at work due to witnessing a lot of safety concerns, and challenges communicating with his supervisors.  However, he reported having a friendship with another servicemember at work.  The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  The examiner indicated that current symptoms included depressed mood; anxiety; chronic sleep impairment; flattened affect; impaired judgment; disturbances of motivation or mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  

VA treatment records prior to June 4, 2021, reflect that the Veteran responded to questions appropriately, was emotionally labile, and denied depression, anxiety, memory loss, suicidal/homicidal ideation, and hallucinations.  See VA treatment records dated April 2019, November 2019, and April 2020.  Further, the records do not reflect that the Veteran was receiving any mental health treatment.  Id.

Following review, the Board finds that the available evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's PTSD independently rendered him unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment prior to June 4, 2021.  As noted previously, evidence from that period shows, among other things, that the Veteran was cooperative; had normal judgment; was appropriately groomed; had an appropriate mood and affect; was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation; denied anxiety, memory loss, suicidal/homicidal ideation, and hallucinations; and was not receiving any mental health treatment.

In fact, as noted previously, it was not until the October 2021 VA examination that a worsening of the Veteran's PTSD was demonstrated.  At that time, his PTSD was found to manifest with occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.  The examiner indicated that symptoms at that time included, among other things, depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occurred weekly or less often; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss; disturbances of motivation or mood; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work and a work-like setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; impaired impulse control; and neglect of personal appearance.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board must conclude that the appropriate effective date for the award of a TDIU is no earlier than June 4, 2021.  The evidence simply does not demonstrate that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran became unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due solely to his PTSD alone prior to June 4, 2021.  The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the appeal of this issue must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), additional compensation is available for a veteran who is in receipt of a 100 percent rating and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more; or, is permanently housebound due to service-connected disabilities.  The requirement of being permanently housebound is met when the Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises, or if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

In this case, the Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling, to include on the basis of a TDIU, prior to June 4, 2021.  Rather, his combined rating prior to that date was 20 percent from October 1, 2003, and 80 percent from July 1, 2018.  Moreover, he has not contended, nor does the record otherwise reflect, that he was permanently housebound due to his service-connected disabilities prior to that date.  The appeal of this issue must also be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
