REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to a service-connected mental disorder, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1961 to March 1964.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  On October 31, 2024, the Veteran's attorney withdrew the hearing request.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As a preliminary matter, the Board observes that the Veteran's attorney has submitted numerous Privacy Act requests, most recently received in April 2025, pertaining to VA's decision regarding the Veteran's competency.  In addition, the Veteran's attorney requested evidence/decisions pertaining to VA's decision concerning the Veteran's competency.  See also May 2024 decision (addressing incompetency, and finding the Veteran competent).  In February 2025 correspondence, the Board provided a copy of all updated documents to the Veteran's attorney, which should have encompassed the May 2024 decision.  The Veteran's attorney was advised to contact the VA Office of General Counsel if the February 2025 response was considered to be a denial of any part of the Privacy Act request.

In addition, the Privacy Act request(s) discussed above included a request to revise a March 13, 2024, rating decision to the extent that it did not separately enumerate matters addressed within the decision.  The Veteran's attorney should contact the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) for further information regarding this request.  Finally, the Board acknowledges the request from the Veteran's attorney for the curriculum vitae (C.V.) of the examiner that conducted the July 2024 VA sleep apnea examination.  This request has been submitted to the VBA for processing.  

Sleep Apnea

As it pertains to this appeal, the Veteran submitted a claim to readjudicate service connection for sleep apnea in August 2020.  See August 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran indicated that his sleep apnea was secondary to his mental disorder.  See July 6, 2023, rating decision (granting service connection for schizophrenia); see generally Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136 (2024).  In August 2020 correspondence, the Veteran was advised to submit his claim to readjudicate service connection for sleep apnea on the proper form, which he submitted on August 24, 2020.  See August 2020 VA Form 20-0995.

Direct service connection for sleep apnea was denied in a September 2020 rating decision, which the Veteran appealed to the Board.  See June 2021 VA Form 10182.  A February 2022 Board decision denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.  The Veteran appealed that part of the February 2022 Board decision that denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In March 2023, the Court granted the Veteran's and the Secretary's joint motion for partial remand (JMPR), vacating and remanding that part of the February 2022 Board decision that denied entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea.

In June 2023, the Board remanded the Veteran's service connection claim for obstructive sleep apnea to obtain a new VA opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea.  On July 24, 2023, the Veteran was afforded a new VA examination.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service, to include in-service exposure to asbestos.  The Veteran timely appealed the August 2023 notice of decision in which the service connection claim for sleep apnea was denied.  The Veteran's attorney submitted evidence within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the Board hearing request, which pertains generally to an association between obstructive sleep apnea and schizophrenia.

As noted above, the Veteran raised the theory of entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to his mental disorder prior to the August 2023 notice of the decision on appeal.  Additionally, as noted above, the Veteran was granted service connection for schizophrenia prior to issuing the August 2023 notice of the decision on appeal.  In this case, the medical opinions obtained by VA failed to address the Veteran's assertion that his sleep apnea is related to his mental disorder.  The Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain a new VA medical opinion to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (once VA undertakes providing a claimant with a medical examination, it has a duty to ensure the examination is adequate).         

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a medical opinion addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea.  If an opinion cannot be provided without a VA examination, the Veteran should be schedule for a new examination. Following a review of the record, and if necessary, a new VA examination, the examiner is asked to respond to the following:

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is caused by or otherwise due to his service-connected schizophrenia.

(b)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is aggravated by his service-connected schizophrenia.

A complete medical rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.
