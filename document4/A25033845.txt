REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1967 to June 1970.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in March 2022.  The Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  In June 2022, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. ยง 20.302(a).  

In December 2022, the Board issued a decision which found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder, but denied the claim on the merits.  The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an August 2024 Memorandum Decision, the Court vacated the Board's December 2022 decision and remanded the matter to the Board for additional consideration consistent with its decision.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder

The Board cannot make a fully-informed decision on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder because no VA examiner has opined whether the Veteran's diagnosed low back pain is related to his active duty service.  Parenthetically, the Board notes that the AOJ's March 2022 rating decision provided a favorable finding of a current diagnosis, citing private medical treatment records which provide a diagnosis of low back pain.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. ยง 3.104(c).

Because there is evidence of a current low back disorder which the Veteran reports had their onset during service in 1968, remand for a VA examination to determine the etiology of the low back disability is warranted.  The AOJ's failure to obtain a VA examination constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error warranting remand.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-83 (2006).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Veteran with a VA examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the etiology of his low back disorder.  The Veteran's claims file, all electronic records, and a copy of this remand must be reviewed by the examiner, and the examiner must state that this evidence was reviewed in the examination report.  All pertinent symptomatology and findings must be reported in detail.  All indicated tests and studies must be accomplished.

Based upon a complete review of the evidence of record, the VA examiner must state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's low back disorder was incurred in or caused by his active duty service.

A complete rationale for all opinions must be provided.  The examiner must consider and discuss all pertinent evidence in the claims file, to include the Veteran's lay statements.  Also, the examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptomatology.
