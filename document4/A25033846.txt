REMANDED

Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a cardiac disability, previously adjudicated as coronary artery disease, status-post stent placement, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from August 1980 to October 1984.

Procedural History

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received his VA Form 10182, whichever date is later, unless the Veteran has requested to waive that right. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (June 21, 2024).  Although the Veteran has not requested to waive this right, the Board finds the Veteran is not prejudiced as a remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal and a remand is not considered a final appealable decision of the issue on appeal. Cooper v. McDonough, 38 Vet. App. 1 (2024). 

Representative

In August 2017, the Veteran appointed Kathryn P. Murphy, Esq., to represent him in the claims process.  However, in March 2024, the Veteran notified the AOJ that Ms. Murphy had informed him that she would not represent him in his claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  He consented to this limitation, requesting to proceed pro se with his claim.  Therefore, the Board grants this request, and it recognizes the Veteran will proceed accordingly.  The Board will not notify Ms. Murphy of this decision.  

Background Law 

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ??38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

Governing law and regulation provides that a veteran may be awarded compensation for additional disability, not the result of his willful misconduct, if the disability was caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished the Veteran under any law administered by VA, either by a VA employee or in a VA facility as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 1701(3)(A), and the proximate cause of the disability was (1) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or (2) an event not reasonably foreseeable. 38 U.S.C. § 1151; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c), (d)(1), (d)(2).

Remand

On July 29, 2023, the Veteran had a myocardial infarction and sought treatment at Alliance Health Durant (AHD), a hospital in Durant, Oklahoma.  AHD admitted him.  

On July 31, 2023, AHD discharged him.

On August 9, 2023, the Veteran sought treatment at the Oklahoma City VAMC.  The VAMC admitted him.  Records from that hospitalization state the Veteran was "admitted on August 9, 2023 for unresolved chest pain despite taking 1 SL NTG tab.  Pt recently had a stented placed in his LAD for an acute MI, he started having CP on the day prior to admission that resolved with 0.5mg NTG.  Pt's Cardiologist recommended an additional PCI, but the patient wanted to come to VA OKC.  Cardiology service notified in advance patient admitted, heparin drip started.  Pt underwent a LHC on 8/10/2023 and had a PCI placed in the left circumflex artery.  Pt was started on Aspirin 81MG daily, Clopidogrel 75mg 1 tablet daily, Ezetimibe 10mg daily, Famotidine 20mg daily, Losartan 50mg daily, Metoprolol tartrate 20mg bid, Pantoprazole 20mg daily, and Alirocumab sq every 2 weeks.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was discharged home in stable condition.  He will f/u with Cardiology as scheduled."  In sum, the VA records noted: "Left heart catheterization, placement of PCI in the left circumflex, successful."

On August 11, 2023, the Oklahoma City VAMC discharged him.  

On August 13, 2023, the Veteran sought treatment at AHD.  AHD admitted him.  AHD treatment records note the Veteran "underwent angioplasty of the left circumflex artery at the Veterans Administration last week and previous angioplasty with LAD in our hospital, came in with chest pressure, pain, appears to be more musculoskeletal and noncardiac.  Cardiac enzymes were minimally positive, which is possibly coming down from the previous enzyme elevation.  He has severe PTSD from recent procedure and such. symptomatically, he is better.  We did consult with psych and mental health.  He is medically stable.  He denies any suicidal ideation.  He is on good medical regimen including aggressive treatment.  His major concern was recurrent cough, which is persistent, which appears to be more allergic bronchitis rather than cardiac asthma.  His reflux symptoms are stable."   

On August 15, 2023, AHD discharged him.

On November 16, 2023, the Veteran sought treatment at AHD.  AHD admitted him.   AHD treatment records note AHD admitted him "with acute onset of chest pressure, pain, underwent coronary angiogram, which shows high-grade stenosis of obtuse marginal 1, which has large vessel.  Has significant anginal symptoms.  He also has a diagonal artery, which has significant disease.  The patient continued to have recurrent chest pressure, pain.  The patient will benefit from EECP, maximize medical treatment, continue rest of his medication.  Follow up next week in the office to adjust medications accordingly.  He understands clearly and being discharged home with close followup next week in the office."  

On November 17, 2023, AHD discharged him.

On November 21, 2023, the Veteran claimed compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  In his claim, he stated: "On Aug 10 of this year a physician with the OKC VA placed a stent purposely and intentionally across an active artery! That action caused tissue to grow across the opening of that artery! Nov 16 I suffered a heart attack where the intentional and deliberate action was discovered!  The Cardiologist could merely poke wire through the tissue!" 

In March 2024, the AOJ obtained an opinion.  The clinician summarized the Veteran's contention as "the Veteran alleges that the cardiac stent placement he received at the VAMC in August 2023 caused blockage of the stent, resulting in a heart attack in November 2023."  However, the clinician did not answer all questions necessary to adjudicating this claim, most notably whether the Veteran had additional disability resulting from his August 2023 treatment.  Because the AOJ did not obtain an addendum opinion, it erred in assisting the Veteran in prosecuting his claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  Therefore, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) for an addendum opinion.  Because the treatment records indicate the August 2023 procedure was "extremely complex," the AOJ should, if possible, attempt to obtain this opinion from a clinician specializing in cardiology.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum medical opinion, preferably from a clinician specializing in cardiology.  The clinician must review the claims file including this Remand.  The clinician should address the following:

a)	Compare the states of the Veteran's cardiac health before his admission and after his discharge from the Oklahoma City VAMC in August 2023.  Does the Veteran have additional cardiac disability after his treatment at the Oklahoma City VAMC from August 9 to August 11, 2023?  If yes, expressly identify the additional cardiac disability.  If no, explain why not.

b)	If yes, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the treatment he received at the Oklahoma City VAMC from August 9, 2023 to August 11, 2023 caused the additional cardiac disability?  If yes, why?  If no, why not?

c)	Then, for any additional cardiac disability identified that is found due to or the result of the treatment he received at the Oklahoma City VAMC from August 9, 2023 to August 11, 2023, please opine on the propriety of the VA treatment.  Is there any indication of carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA?  If yes, why?  If no, why not?

In providing this opinion, the clinician must consider and address the Veteran's statements in support of his claim, to specifically include his statements in his November 2023 claim, e.g., his contention the VA's placement of his stent hindered his future cardiac treatment.  

d)	If the additional disability was caused by VA treatment, but that treatment is found to not have involved any fault on VA's part, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's additional disability was due to an event not reasonably foreseeable (i.e., one that a reasonable health care provider would not have considered to be an ordinary risk of the treatment provided)?  If yes, why?  If no, why not?

The clinician should provide a complete rationale for each opinion.
