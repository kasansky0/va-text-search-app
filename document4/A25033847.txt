ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is moot; and as such, the appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In April 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for tinnitus; assigned a 10 percent rating for that disability; and effectuated the award as of October 27, 2016.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Service connection for tinnitus has been granted and no allegation of error of fact or law remains.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from April 1968 to April 1972.  

In September 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket.  In a January 6, 2025, written statement, the Veteran withdrew his hearing request. 

Dismissal 

The instant appeal was initiated by the Veteran's September 2021 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking service connection for tinnitus which was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on September 8, 2021.  In April 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for tinnitus based upon development directed by a Board Legacy Remand of the issue of service connection for bilateral hearing loss; assigned a 10 percent rating for that disability; and effectuated the award as of October 27, 2016.  

Generally, a subsequent Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision cannot divest the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) of jurisdiction over a prior appeal.  See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136-48 (2024); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 204 (2021); see also Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 214, 221 (2016).  However, the Board finds that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's favorable April 2022 action has been granted all benefits sought in the instant appeal and assigned an effective date earlier than that would arise from an allowance of this Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeal.  No allegation of fact or law remains.  Therefore, the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.
