ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his current lumbar spine disability was aggravated during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1987 to October 1989, from July 1995 to January 1996, and from June 2011 to July 2012. He also had additional periods of service U.S. Army Reserve, the U.S. Navy Reserve, and the U.S. Air National Guard. The Board is grateful for the Veteran's honorable service to our Nation!

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 higher-level review rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability. In July 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.

As the Veteran chose the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is granted. 

The Veteran maintains entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability. For the reasons that follow, and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.

Service connection can be granted for a veteran in any period of ACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty and any period of INACDUTRA during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident which occurred during such training. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6.

Veteran status must be established as a condition of eligibility for service-connection. Bowers v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 201, 206 (2013) (observing that it is "axiomatic that, to receive VA disability compensation benefits, an appellant must first establish veteran status"). To establish veteran status based on a period of ACDUTRA, a claimant's disability must relate to a disease or injury that was incurred or aggravated during the period of ACDUTRA. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(a), (d); Harris v. West, 13 Vet. App. 509, 511 (2000).

Unless and until veteran status is established for any period of ACDUTRA, the presumptions of soundness and presumptions of service connection accorded to certain diseases under the statute and pertinent regulations do not apply. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1153; Bowers, 26 Vet. App. at 206-07.

With respect to a claim for aggravation of a preexisting disorder during ACDUTRA, the presumption of aggravation also does not apply. See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 48 (2010). As service connection based on a period of ACDUTRA requires the presence of a disease or injury during service, service connection may only be established by direct evidence both that a worsening of the disorder occurred during the period of ACDUTRA and that the worsening was caused by the period of ACDUTRA. Id. Any increase in severity must also be permanent. Recurrence or temporary flare-ups of symptoms do not constitute an increase in severity. Davis v. Principi, 273 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran has a current lumbar spine disability. Medical treatment records from the Veteran's August 2021 period of ACDUTRA document his complaints of low back pain due to strenuous exercise and reflect a diagnosis of lumbar strain, and following radiological testing, degenerative changes at the L4-5. 

While the evidence shows that the Veteran's initial injury was sustained outside of the course of his military service, when he jumped off a second story balcony, the Veteran maintains that there was an in-service injury or event during ACDUTRA service in August 2021 that resulted in the permanent worsening of his preexisting injury. The record reflects that the Veteran's participation in strenuous exercise, walking, sprinting, and "in and outs" results in 10/10 lower back pain so severe that the Veteran left training to obtain private treatment, where he was prescribed Toradol, a strong nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, to be taken as needed, and was referred to physical therapy. Moreover, more recent VA treatment records show that the Veteran's low back pain complaints have continued to persist, suggesting that the August 2021 aggravation was permanent rather than a temporary or transient flare.

In light of the foregoing and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the evidence weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, was permanently aggravated during his August 2021 ACDUTRA service. Thus, the claim is granted.
