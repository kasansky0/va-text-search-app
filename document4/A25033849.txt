CONCLUSION OF LAW

The overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits in the amount of $1,190 for housing allowance was validly created.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3311, 3322, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.956, 1.962, 21.4136, 21.9695.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from August 2018 to July 2019.

The administrative decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in April 2021.  In a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) filed in August 2022, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option for this appeal; however, he submitted additional evidence at that time, which the Board is not permitted to review.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  In January 2025, the Board notified the Veteran that the additional evidence cannot be considered in conjunction with this appeal and informed the Veteran how to request a docket change to allow for the submission of the evidence.  The Veteran has not responded to this clarification letter, so the Board will proceed on the originally selected docket.  Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence in the record at the time of the April 2021 AOJ decision.  

Further, the Board notes there are some irregularities with the procedure in this appeal.  To contest the April 2021 administrative decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in August 2021; however, he failed to identify the date of the decision he was appealing.  In May 2022, the Board notified the Veteran of this error and informed him he could cure it by responding with a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days.  The Veteran filed the new VA Form 10182 in August 2022, after the 60 days had expired.  However, in January 2023, the Board accepted this filing and docketed the Veteran's appeal, and informed him the case had been docketed.  Therefore, the Board finds the claims-processing rule regarding timeliness of the clarifying VA Form 10182 is waived, and will proceed on the merits of this appeal.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal).

Whether an overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits in the calculated amount of $1,190 for housing allowance was validly created

VA generally is required to recover erroneous VA payments or overpayments of benefits.  See Edwards v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 57, 59 (2008); 38 U.S.C. § 5314(a) (generally requiring VA to deduct from future benefit payments a debt arising from a person's participation in a VA benefits program); 38 C.F.R. § 1.912a(a); 38 U.S.C. § 5316 (authorizing VA to recover benefits-related debt by bringing suit if the person fails to appropriately respond to reasonable administrative efforts to collect the debt).

When the Secretary finds that an overpayment has been made to a veteran or other eligible person, the amount of the overpayment shall constitute a liability of the veteran or eligible person to the United States.  38 U.S.C. § 3685; Mountford v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 443, 450, n.6 (2011).  An overpayment is created when VA determines that a beneficiary or payee has received monetary benefits to which he is not entitled, and may arise from virtually any VA benefits program, including a program of educational assistance benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.962, 1.956(a).

The issue of whether the underlying debt is valid is a threshold determination that must be made prior to a decision on a request for waiver of indebtedness.  See Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430 (1991).  A debtor may dispute the amount or existence of a debt, which is a right that may be exercised separately from a request for waiver or at the same time.  See 38 C.F.R. § 1.911(c)(1); see also VAOPGCPREC 6-98.  

For a determination that an overpayment was not properly created such that the debt is not valid, it must be established that the claimant was either legally entitled to the benefits in question or, if the claimant was not legally entitled, then it must be shown that VA was solely responsible for the claimant being erroneously paid benefits.  

VA will not pay Chapter 33 education benefits for a course from which a student withdraws or receives a non-punitive grade unless the student withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty or mitigating circumstances are demonstrated.  38 C.F.R. §§ 21.4135, 21.4136, 21.7135.  Mitigating circumstances means circumstances beyond the individual's control that prevent him from continuously pursuing a program of education.  38 C.F.R. § 21.9505.  

Relevant regulatory provisions state that "in the first instance of a withdrawal from a course or courses for which the eligible individual received educational assistance, VA will consider mitigating circumstances to exist with respect to the withdrawal of a course or courses totaling no more than six semester hours or the equivalent."  38 C.F.R. § 21.9635(b).  The regulations further provide that "[i]f mitigating circumstances are considered to exist in accordance with this paragraph, VA will terminate or reduce educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the withdrawal occurred."  Id.

In this case, the Veteran served in the Army from August 2018 to July 2019, and is eligible for the receipt of Chapter 33 education benefits.  

In April 2021, the Veteran's educational institution notified VA that he withdrew from six semester hours during the January 2021 to May 2021 term, after the drop period, with non-punitive grades being assigned.  The institution reported that the Veteran withdrew as of January 30, 2021.

The record further indicates that the AOJ excused the Veteran's withdrawal, as it was the first time he withdrew while using Chapter 33 benefits.  In the April 2021 notice letter on appeal, the AOJ informed the Veteran that VA would pay educational assistance benefits for the month during which the withdrawal occurred.  Because VA had already paid tuition benefits and housing allowance benefits through March 13, 2021, an overpayment was created representing the amount of these benefits paid after January 31, 2021.

In his August 2022 appeal, the Veteran asserted that he withdrew from the course due to extended illness.

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the overpayment of $1,190 for housing allowance was validly created.

Specifically, the Board finds the record is clear that the Veteran was not legally entitled to the housing allowance benefits for the months of February 2021 and March 2021.  Typically, VA will pay no Chapter 33 education benefits for courses from which a veteran withdrew; however, in this case, VA applied the mitigating circumstances exception as it was the Veteran's first such withdrawal.  Under that exception, VA was permitted to, and did, pay benefits for the period of time during which the Veteran was enrolled in the course.  In this case, that period of time was solely during the month of January 2021; therefore, the housing allowance benefits that had been paid for February 2021 and March 2021 were a benefit the Veteran was not legally entitled to keep. 

Finally, the Board finds there is no evidence of any administrative error by VA in the payment of the Veteran's Chapter 33 education benefits.  The AOJ notified the Veteran of the change in his education benefits due to his withdrawal the same month as the educational institution informed VA of the withdrawal.  The housing allowance payment had already been disbursed when VA received notice of the Veteran's withdrawal.  Therefore, the Board finds the overpayment is not the result of sole administrative error by VA.  

For these reasons, the Board finds the overpayment of $1,190 for housing allowance is valid.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a waiver of an overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits in the amount of $1,190 for housing allowance is remanded.

An overpayment of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits becomes a liability to the individual that was paid the benefits unless the liability was waived by a regional office Committee on Waivers and Compromises, or the overpayment results from an administrative error or an error in judgment.  38 C.F.R. § 21.9695(b); see 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.957, 1.962 (waiver of overpayments).

In this case, the April 2021 decision on appeal did not address whether a waiver of overpayment was warranted, so that issue is not properly before the Board at present; however, the Board finds it is part and parcel of the Veteran's appeal, as he has contested the overpayment generally.  Therefore, a remand is necessary for consideration of the Veteran's case by a Committee on Waivers and Compromises.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After completing necessary notice to the Veteran, and any additional development action deemed warranted, the appropriate Committee on Waivers and Compromises should readjudicate the claim of whether a waiver of recovery of the $1,190 overpayment for housing allowance is warranted.
