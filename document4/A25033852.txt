DOCKET NO. 211123-492273
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

As the appellant's request for waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under Chapter 35, United States Code, was not timely filed, the appeal must be denied.

FINDING OF FACT

1. On October 19, 2019, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Debt Management Center (DMC) mailed correspondence to the appellant, notifying her that a debt resulting from overpayment of DEA benefits had been created; the notice informed the appellant of her right to dispute the debt and to request a waiver.

2. On October 23, 2019, the DMC mailed a second notice to the appellant, notifying her of an increase in her overpayment debt; this notice specifically informed the appellant that any waiver request must be received within 180 days.

3. The Veteran's request for waiver of recovery of the overpayment of DEA benefits was dated May 28, 2021, and was indicated to have been received on June 3, 2021, more than 180 days after the October 2019 debt notification letters were sent.

4. The appellant has not demonstrated that as a result of an error by either VA or the postal authorities, or due to the other circumstances beyond the appellant's control, there was a delay in the receipt of notification of indebtedness.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

A timely request for a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of DEA benefits was not received.  38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from June 2010 to August 2014, including combat service for which he received, among other decorations, the Purple Heart.  The appellant is the Veteran's spouse.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Debt Management Center's (DMC's) that the appellant's request for a waiver of recovery of indebtedness in the amount of $856.80, for an overpayment of DEA benefits, was untimely. 

On November 23,2021, the appellant filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which she elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Timeliness of Waiver Request

At the time of the decision on appeal, a request for waiver of indebtedness must have been made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness, for notices issued on or after April 1, 1983.  38 C.F.R. § 1.963.  (Parenthetically, the Board note on December 29, 2022, Congress enacted the "Joseph Maxwell Cleland and Robert Joseph Dole Memorial Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2022", which amended 38 U.S.C. § 5302 to extend the window to request a waiver from 180 days to 1 year, effective December 29, 2024.  See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, P.L. 117-328, Section 254; 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a)(1).  As the effective date of this amendment postdates the decision on appeal, the amended criteria are not applicable to the current appeal.)  The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrated to the Chairperson of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC) that, as a result of an error by either VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing (including forwarding).  Id.  If the requester does substantiate that there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the Chairperson shall direct that the 180-day period be computed from the date of the requester's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness.  Id. 

A review of the record shows that in July 2019, the appellant was notified that she was eligible for DEA benefits.  The appellant then enrolled in an undergraduate program of education at Fayetteville Technical Community College beginning in August 2019.  Specifically, the appellant was enrolled in 6 resident and 3 distance credit hours for the term running from August 19 through December 14, 2019.  On September 9, 2019, the appellant withdrew from classes and non-punitive grades were assigned.  Since the appellant withdrew from classes, VA terminated her DEA benefits, which action created an overpayment and resulting debt in the total amount of $856.80.

In letters from the DMC dated in October 2019, the appellant was notified that she had been overpaid VA education benefits (DEA benefits) in the amounts of $676.90 and 179.90; the total overpayment of benefits was $856.80.  Regarding the appellant's rights, the October 19, 2019, letter informed the appellant that she had "the right to dispute the debt and the right to request a waiver."  This debt notification letter then stated: "Please see the back of this letter for more information about how to do that."  The Board acknowledges that the record does not contain a copy of the back of the October 19, 2019, letter.  The back of the DMC letters, however, are known to notify debtors of their burden for requesting a waiver, to include that they must submit the request in writing within 180 days with an explanation of any responsibility he/she had in causing the debt or why he/she was not responsible for it.  To the extent that the back of the letter did not contain this information, the Board points out that the second debt notification letter, dated October 23, 2019, specifically informed the appellant that if she could not pay her debt, she could request a waiver "within 180 days of the date of this letter."  Thus, the Board finds that the appellant was appropriately advised of the timeframe within which to request a waiver.

The record then contains the appellant's request for waiver, dated May 28, 2021, which the AOJ has said was received on June 3, 2021.  In that request, the appellant stated that she received a letter on May 10, 2021, informing her a debt resulting from the overpayment of DEA benefits.  Notably, the record does not contain any letters dated in May 2021 regarding her overpayment debt.  To the extent the appellant is alleging that the October 2019 DMC letters were not received until May 2021, the Board notes that the October 2019 notices were mailed to the appellant at her then-current address of record and were not returned as undeliverable.  The appellant has not provided any evidence to suggest that there was a delay in her receipt of the October 2019 notifications of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing, to include an envelope showing that the debt notification letters had been forwarded to a new address or containing a later postmark.  The appellant's statement that she did not receive notification of her debt until May 2021 is also contradicted by the statement in her VA Form 10182 that she had filed a request for waiver within 180-days of the October 2019 DMC notification letters, as this statement would suggest that she received notification of the debt and her right to request a waiver prior to May 2021.  As such, the Board cannot rely on the appellant's statement in her May 2021 waiver request to find that there was a delay in the receipt of the October 2019 notices of indebtedness.

Accordingly, there is no basis upon which the Board can conclude that the appellant did not timely receive the October 2019 DMC letters such that the 180-day window in which to file a request for waiver may be extended in this case.  As the Veteran's request for waiver was not received within the 180-day window from the DMC's October 2019 notices of indebtedness, it was not timely filed.  The Board is thus constrained from considering the merits of the appellant's waiver request and the appeal must be denied.

In finding that the appellant's waiver request was not timely filed, the Board also acknowledges the argument made in VA Form 10182, that her "first initial appeal was sent before the 180 day time limit."  Unfortunately, however, the record does not contain any request for waiver dated prior to May 2021.  Although the appellant has alleged that VA may have lost her initial waiver request, the appellant has produced no evidence to show that she made an initial request for waiver within the 180-day time limit.  Indeed, her May 2021 waiver request does not reference any earlier filed request for waiver, which the Board would expect to see in that correspondence had an earlier request been filed.  Further, her May 2021 waiver request states that she had received notice of her debt that same month, which statement is contradictory to her having filed an earlier request for waiver.  As such, the Board finds the argument raised in her VA Form 10182 to be without merit, as her statements are contradicted by her own earlier assertions that she had only received notification of her debt in May 2021.
