DOCKET NO. 211110-196855
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder, claimed as a mental health condition, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in relative equipoise that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder began in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to May 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the November 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

Service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder

The Veteran seeks service connection for a mental health condition, which he contends is related his period of active service. Specifically, he testified that he was always nervous and his symptoms became worse when he went to the flight line with all the noise.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service treatment records show the Veteran complained of nervousness. He had psychiatry consultations in 1970 and 1972, but no psychiatric illnesses were found. 

VA treatment records document that the Veteran had complaints of anxiety in 2003 due to multiple stressors. He was diagnosed with unspecified anxiety disorder under the DSM-5 criteria in October 2019.

The Veteran submitted a private psychological evaluation in February 2025 where his diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder under the DSM-5 criteria was corroborated. The provider conducted a thorough psychological evaluation and reviewed the Veteran's file. He noted stressors from being on the flight deck while stationed in Thailand. He opined that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder is at least as likely as not due to the stressors during service.

Based on the foregoing, the only competent and credible evidence of record concerning a nexus is the February 2025 private medical opinion, which establishes that his unspecified anxiety disorder is due to service, and thus the Veteran's appeal is granted.
