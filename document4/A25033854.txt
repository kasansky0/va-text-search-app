REMANDED

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to May 10, 2019, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active-duty service from September 2005 to March 2015.

The Board notes that a hearing was held in August 2023 before a Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of that hearing is of record.

In October 2023, the Board denied the Veteran entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 10, 2019, for the award of service connection for PSTD. Thereafter, the Veteran appealed the denial to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), and in May 2024 the parties agreed to a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) for reasons as detailed at greater length below. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to May 10, 2019, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

Per the May 2024 JMR, the Board erred by having relied upon an inadequate medical examination in denying the claim, as neither the June nor August 2019 VA examiners ever addressed the onset date as to the Veteran's ultimate diagnosis of PTSD in their reports. Thus, the Board finds that a remand is in order to acquire an addendum medical opinion to address the aforesaid deficiencies in the record prior to the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. ยง 19.9(a).  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Acquire an addendum medical opinion on remand assessing the onset date of the Veteran's PTSD. Upon review of the record, to include this remand, as well as indicated below, the VA examiner is requested to opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of PTSD at the time of his June 29, 2015, VA Form 21-526EZ filing. 

The VA examiner should address the evidence of record indicating that the Veteran may have been suffering PTSD well before it was ultimately diagnosed in June of 2019. See, e.g. document titled "Appellate Brief (VSO IHP; Post remand Brief; Attorney Brief)," receipt dated December 6, 2024.

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.
