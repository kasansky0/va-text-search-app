ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.385. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1971 to August 1973 and from May 1981 to July 1981.   

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In an August 2023 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the August 2023 rating decision.  

In February 2024, the RO issued the HLR decision on appeal, again denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

In June 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2010); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Gutierrez v. Principi, 19 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999)).  

The absence of any one element will result in the denial of service connection.  Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006).

Whether service connection is claimed on direct, presumptive, or any other basis, a necessary element for establishing such a claim is the existence of a current disability.  Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997).  The presence of a disability at the time of filing of a claim or during its pendency warrants a finding that the current disability requirement has been met, even if the disability resolves prior to the Board's adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1395 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that if the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss he contends is due to service.

The Board has reviewed the Veteran's records and finds the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.

The determination of whether a veteran has a disability based on hearing loss is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  For the purposes of applying the law administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by Favorable Findings of Fact by the RO.  Here, the RO found that the following favorable findings: 

"	The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. 

"	A nexus, or link, has been established between your claimed issue and an in-service event or injury. 

"	Participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded.

As to a current disability, the records do not show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. 

On the authorized audiological evaluation in August 2023, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	35	20	15	10	30

LEFT	25	30	20	20	30

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and of 94 in the left ear.

There are also no medical treatment records indicating that the Veteran has been treated for a hearing problem during the period on appeal.  

The Veteran's representative argues that the RO erred in denying service-connection based on a singular exam when a favorable in-service event and nexus were already established.  See July 2024 Appellate Brief.  Again, disability based on hearing loss is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The Board notes that the Veteran's audiological evaluation in August 2023 did not show evidence that he met the criteria for established hearing loss for VA purposed and there are no other audiological tests in the record to support that the VA examination findings were incorrect.  

Additionally, citing Harris v. Derwinski, the Veteran's representative argues that there is evidence of entitlement for hearing loss through his "inextricably intertwined tinnitus disability" which was not considered by the VA examiner in August 2023.  Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991); see July 2024 Appellate Brief.  Despite both disabilities being related to the ear/hearing, hearing loss and tinnitus are distinctly different conditions.  Both conditions were evaluated during the August 2023 VA examination and the RO granted service-connection for tinnitus.  However, the representative's argument that the conditions are "inextricably intertwined" is misguided.  In Harris, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that where a decision on one issue would have a 'significant impact' upon another and that impact in turn could render any appellate review on the other claim meaningless and a waste of judicial resources, the two claims are inextricably intertwined.  The idea that conditions are inextricably intertwined relates to adjudicating issues/claims and does not infer that if one condition is granted, the other should be as well.

Therefore, because the Veteran has not been shown to have a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

In reaching the above conclusions the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the claim that doctrine is not applicable in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.
