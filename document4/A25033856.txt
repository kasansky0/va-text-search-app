ORDER

Service connection for a right ankle disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's right ankle disability clearly and unmistakably preexisted his active-duty service and was not permanently worsened beyond its natural progression by such service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

 The criteria for service connection for a right ankle disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1980 to September 1990. He died in June 2024. The Appellant is his surviving spouse, who has been substituted for the Veteran as the claimant. See March 2025 notification letter.

Prior to the Veteran's death, a November 2018 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for right ankle sprain. The Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement in May 2019 and a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in February 2020.

In March 2020, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0996, requesting to opt-in to the modernized review system, requesting higher-level review pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Accordingly, an August 2020 higher level review rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for right ankle sprain. 

Thereafter, the Veteran timely appealed the rating decision to the Board and selected the Direct Review docket under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). See August 2020 VA Form 10182. This claim was still pending at the time of the Veteran's death. As noted above, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) substituted the Appellant as the Veteran's claimant in this matter after she made a request for such in January 2025.

In light of the request for Direct Review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2020 SOC. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the February 2020 SOC, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection for Right Ankle

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service--the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

A veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Only such conditions as are recorded on a veteran's examination report are to be considered as "noted." 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

To be "noted" within the meaning of the presumption of soundness statute, the condition must be recorded in the entrance examination report. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1132; Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994). History of pre-service existence of a disease does not constitute a notation of such condition. Id. at 240. However, the disease need not be symptomatic at the time of the evaluation, so long as a diagnosis is provided. See Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529, 530 (1996).

When a preexisting condition is not noted on a veteran's entrance examination, the burden is on the government to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that the veteran's disability was both pre-existing and not aggravated by service. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). As further explained in Horn v. Shinseki: 

Once the presumption of soundness applies, the burden of proof remains with the Secretary on both the preexistence and the aggravation prong; it never shifts back to the claimant. In particular, even when there is clear and unmistakable evidence of preexistence, the claimant need not produce any evidence of aggravation in order to prevail under the aggravation prong of the presumption of soundness... the burden is not on the claimant to show that their disability increased in severity; rather, it is on VA to establish by clear and unmistakable evidence that it did not or that any increase was due to the natural progress of the disease. 

Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 235 (2012).

A pre-existing injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated during service when there is an increase in disability during service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progression of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a). Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 402 (1995). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered "aggravation in service" unless the underlying condition itself, as contrasted with mere symptoms, has worsened. See Jensen v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 304, 306-7 (1993). Accordingly, "a lasting worsening of the condition" - that is, a worsening that existed not only at the time of separation but one that still exists currently is required. See Routen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 183, 189 n. 2 (1997).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection for right ankle pain in March 2018. See VA Form 21-526EZ. He generally maintained, and the Appellant now maintains, that a right ankle disability was incurred in or aggravated by active-duty service. No specific argument has been submitted in this regard.

In a May 1980 letter, Dr. IM stated that the Veteran: 

Has been under my care since Feb. 28, 1979 for a fracture of the medial malleolus of the right ankle. On March 2, 1979 he underwent surgery involving open reduction and internal screw fixation of the fractured medial malleolus.

The [Veteran] was admitted to hospital on March 13, 1980 for removal of screw, right ankle and this was performed on March 17, 1980. 

[The Veteran] has had very good results from the surgery and his ankle is healing properly. It is my opinion that he is physically fit for basic training as a member of the armed forces.

Dr. IM enclosed copies of the March 1979 hospital report which notes the Veteran underwent surgery after injuring his right ankle when slipping on ice and the March 1980 operation record which shows the screw removal.

An April 1980 enlistment Report of Medical History shows the Veteran reported undergoing operations for a screw insertion and then removal in the right ankle, with no sequelae. An April 1980 enlistment Report of Medical Examination includes the May 1980 attachment which notes the Veteran's history of right ankle fracture with screw fixation in 1979 and screw removal in 1980. X-ray studies showed a right residual deformity of the tip of the right medial malleolus and examination showed a well-healed scar. Range of motion was "good" and without pain. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's right ankle disability clearly and unmistakably existed prior to such service. The remaining question on appeal is whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrating that the preexisting right ankle disability was not aggravated by the Veteran's active-duty service.

Service treatment records (STRs) show that in January 1980 the Veteran was placed on temporary profile for one month for status post-fracture to right ankle. He was to avoid prolonged standing, walking, or aerobics. In October 1980 he was again placed on temporary profile twice, this time for a total of three weeks, for pain secondary to old right ankle fracture. At the end of this time, he reported his ankle was feeling better. The Veteran was placed on temporary physical profile for three months beginning in January 1983 because of his right ankle. He was to avoid prolonged standing, walking, and aerobics. In February 1987 the Veteran was treated for a painful right ankle after jumping off of a five-foot-high ledge at work. The assessment was a right ankle sprain. He was placed on physical profile from February 4, 1987, to March 1, 1987, for ankle strain. He was on crutches and restricted from aerobics, running, and prolonged standing. There is no subsequent treatment for a right ankle condition shown in service. A musculoskeletal examination during a psychiatric admission in August 1990 was normal.

Following service, VA treatment records show the Veteran was seen by Dr. IM in August 2003. The Veteran complained of a painful right elbow. However, he also told Dr. IM that he was the one who had operated on his right ankle fracture in 1979, and later removed the screw. Dr. IM noted, "He is pleased to tell me that he has had no problems with the ankle ever since, which is gratifying."

In June 2018, a VA Ankle Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) notes the Veteran's history of right ankle fracture prior to service. The Veteran reported that his ankle began to hurt again during the last couple of years of his service after sustaining a sprain. Since service, he had experienced soreness and weakness with flare-ups of pain and swelling with increased activity but had not sought treatment. On examination, right ankle range of motion was normal. No pain was noted. There was tenderness to palpation, which the examiner stated was 1/10 in severity. Muscle strength was full. There was no ankle instability. Diagnosis was right ankle strain. The examiner noted the Veteran was limited in prolonged standing and ambulation.

In a September 2018 VA Medical Opinion DBQ, the VA examiner noted the claims file had been reviewed and that it showed the Veteran was seen with right ankle complaints in service. The examiner opined that the Veteran's right ankle disability, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that the Veteran had a history for a right ankle fracture with surgical repair prior to joining service as noted at enlistment; he received a waiver to enlist. The examiner further explained that STRs reflected an evaluation for ankle strain in February 1987 that was managed conservatively. Currently, "exam revealed full ROM [range of motion] and minimal tenderness to palpation consistent with a current tendonitis. Tendonitis is a common ailment of overuse for active individuals as commonly seen in the military. However given the time frame since injury, and no continual care or complaint or chronic management as well as normal ROM on exam, a natural progression is likely." The Board finds this opinion to be highly probative as it is well reasoned and based on a thorough review of the Veteran's claims file, to include his service treatment records and pre- and post-service medical records. Notably, there are no probative medical opinions, or other competent evidence, to the contrary in this case.

Even acknowledging the Veteran's in-service complaints related to the right ankle, the Board finds that the 2018 VA examiner's opinion/rationale is more probative than the Veteran's (and Appellant's) general contentions. Consistent with the VA examiner's statements above, the inservice complaints represented a normal progression of a pre-existing condition and were not the cause of unnatural aggravation. As noted, temporary or intermittent flare-ups of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered aggravation in service. See Jensen, 4 Vet. App. 304 at 306-7. Moreover, the Veteran denied seeking treatment for his ankle following service, and the numerous post-service treatment records do not show otherwise. In fact, the Veteran reported to Dr. IM in August 2003 that he had had no problems with the ankle since the 1979 surgery. The record is then silent for any right ankle complaints until 2018 when the Veteran submitted his claim. This is more than 25 years after separation from service. Thus, to the extent that the Veteran had issues with his right ankle disorder during service, the evidence does not otherwise show a permanent worsening of the pre-existing condition to substantiate a claim of aggravation.

Moreover, the Veteran and Appellant are not competent, as laypersons, to provide an opinion or evidence as to matters involving medical diagnosis or etiology. The question of whether the Veteran's right ankle disorder was aggravated by or progressed in service is medical in nature, and they are not competent to opine on such matters. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence shows the Veteran's right ankle disability clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service and was not permanently worsened (aggravated) beyond its natural progression by such service. Accordingly, service connection for a right ankle disability must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
