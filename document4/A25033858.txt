DOCKET NO. 210527-162540
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

For the entire period on appeal, a 50 percent disability rating (but no higher) for the Veteran's service-connected migraines is granted.

For the entire period on appeal, a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's headaches more closely manifest symptoms associated with the rating criteria for a 50 percent rating; the Board assigns significant probative weight to the Veteran's March 2024 Board hearing testimony regarding her daily migraines which are debilitating and can last up to two days and prevent her from maintaining employment; The February 2021 VA examiner checked the box indicating the Veteran's migraines are "very severe, occurring daily," and the Veteran has missed two to four weeks of work in the recent past; the Veteran's migraines are manifested with symptoms of constant head pain, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and changes in vision, which produces severe economic inadaptability on a monthly basis.

2. Affording the Veteran the benefit of doubt, the evidence is approximately balanced (nearly equal) in favor of finding the Veteran's service-connected disabilities prevent the Veteran from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment for the entire period on appeal; the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for the entire period on appeal. [The Board assigns significant probative weight to the Veteran's March 2024 Board hearing testimony regarding the fact that she is no longer working and the impacts her service-connected disabilities have on her ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment.]

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the entire period on appeal, the criteria are met for a 50 percent rating (but no higher) for the Veteran's service-connected migraines. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (Code) 8100.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the criteria are met for a TDIU rating. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1975 to July 1977. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2021 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on March 18, 2025. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board cannot, by law, consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The record reflects that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities may have prevented her from working during the appeal period. See March 2024 Board hearing. Because a TDIU rating is inherent in any claim for an increased rating, see Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), it has been added as an issue.

1. For the entire period on appeal, a 50 percent rating (but no higher) for the Veteran's service-connected migraines is granted.

For the reasons outlined in more detail above in the Findings of Fact section, the appeal for an increased rating of 50 percent for the Veteran's migraines is granted.

Based on the testimony received at the March 2025 Board hearing, this is considered a full grant of the benefit sought.

2. For the entire period on appeal, a TDIU rating is granted.

For the reasons outlined in more detail above in the Findings of Fact section, the appeal for a TDIU rating is granted.
