DOCKET NO. 210614-165967
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In October 2021, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate this appeal on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1984 to August 1988. 

This matter is on appeal from a June 2020 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim(s) at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim(s). This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

The AOJ must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1). In December 2021, VA received a request for substitution. To date, the AOJ has not ruled on that request. If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. §?20.1302(a).
