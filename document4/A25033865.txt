DOCKET NO. 210609-165062
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for nasal fracture maxillofacial trauma is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army from February 1983 to September 1994.

The matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

On December 2, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R.  

§ 20.205(b)(1).

Here, the Veteran filed a "Statement in Support of Claim" and a separate email message on December 2, 2024, which included, collectively, the Veteran's name, Social Security number, and the following statement: "I . . . wish to withdraw the issue on appeal . . . for my nasal fracture maxillofacial trauma (previously deviated septum)." See December 2024 Email Correspondence; see also December 2024 VA 21-4138.

Thus, the issue on appeal has been validly withdrawn and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
