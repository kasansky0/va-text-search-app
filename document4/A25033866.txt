ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided on June 20, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of medical care provided to the Veteran on June 20, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided on June 20, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished services to the Veteran. The appellant billed VA $1,191.00 for the services provided.

In January 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal, electing the evidence submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA AOJ.  

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on June 20, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending. A Report of Contact states that the claim was paid in the amount of $123.01 on July 12, 2022. A July 2022 letter to the appellant stated that, on secondary review, the appeal was approved, and the claim would be processed according to VA policy. A July 2022 explanation of payment (EOP) reflects that $123.01 was paid for the June 20, 2020, episode of care.

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care. If the amount paid for the June 20, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the June 20, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the denial of payment and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is, therefore, dismissed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
