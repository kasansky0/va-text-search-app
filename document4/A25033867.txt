ORDER

The appeal regarding entitlement to educational benefits under Chapter 1606, Title 10 U.S.C., also known as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) Selected Reserve, to include for the period of August 2020 to December 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

An August 2021 Chapter 1606 education Award reflects that the appellant's application for Chapter 1606 benefits was granted, to include for the period of August 2020 to December 2020, thus rendering the appeal moot.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There being no question of fact or law to be decided by the Board, the appeal for entitlement to Chapter 1606 benefits, to include for the period of August 2020 to December 2020, is dismissed as moot, as the benefit was granted in full. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is currently serving as a member of the Army National Guard. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the January 13, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Educational benefits under Chapter 1606, Title 10 U.S.C., also known as the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) Selected Reserve.

The appellant contends that education benefits under the MGIB-Selected Reserve are warranted as he is currently serving in the Army National Guard. He stated that he was "unable to receive GI Bill, even though all requirements are met. Was told I can't receive benefit due to lack of high school diploma." See January 2021 VA From 10182.

The appellant applied for educational benefits under Chapter 1606, Title 10 U.S.C., in August 2020.

Eligibility to MGIB Selected Reserve education benefits under 10 U.S.C.A. § 1606 (Chapter 1606 benefits), is available to individuals that are currently serving in the Reserves/Guard Component. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540 (a).

A September 2020 VA/Department of Defense (DoD) Identity Repository (VADIR) report noted that the appellant was ineligible for Chapter 1606 due to no high school diploma.

A September 2020 VA education document notes an award of Chapter 1606, while also noting ineligibility due to "high school diploma after IADT (Initial Active Duty for Training)."

The appellant applied for educational benefits under Chapter 1606, Title 10 U.S.C., in January 2021.

An August 2021 Chapter 1606 Status and Award History indicates that the appellant was found to be eligible for Chapter 1606 educational benefits based on his current service in the National Guard. 

The appellant was also paid Chapter 1606 educational benefits for the Fall 2020 semester, and the Spring 2021 semester.

As the benefit sought on appeal has been granted, there remains no case or controversy, or dispute of fact or law, regarding the issue. The appeal is moot.

The claim seeking entitlement to Chapter 1606 benefits, to include for the period from August 2020 to December 2020, is therefore dismissed as moot. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. See, e.g., Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 224-225 (2006); Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992) (When the relief sought has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the matter as moot).
