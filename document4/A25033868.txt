REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1989 to June 1993.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of background, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 and VA Form 21-526EZ on October 15, 2020, and sought entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) because of his service-connected psychiatric disability and his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. In a December 2020 rating decision, the RO granted an increase for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability to 70 percent disabling effective October 15, 2020, deferred a decision on an increased evaluation for obstructive sleep apnea, granted entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance, and found the issue of entitlement to a TDIU as moot.

The Veteran submitted a December 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested an Informal Conference.  An Informal Conference was held by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) on January 18, 2022, and the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In an October 2022 rating decision, the RO found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim for entitlement to TDIU on the merits.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2022 decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision.  The AOJ granted entitlement to a TDIU and special monthly compensation based on housebound status effective October 15, 2020.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In an October 2022, the Veteran requested to have his claim expedited based on financial hardship, to include homelessness.  See October 2022 Statement in Support of Claim. As the Board is issuing a decision which grants the Veteran's claims and the Veteran has no other currently pending appeals, this request is rendered moot.

Effective Dates

A claim for entitlement to a?TDIU?is an?increased rating?claim, and, therefore, the effective date rules for increased compensation claims apply. See Norris v. West,?12?Vet. App.?413, 420?(1999); Hurd v. West,?13?Vet. App.?449?(2000).  An effective date for a claim for increase may be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of claim.?38 U.S.C. § 5110?(b)(3);?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400?(o)(1), (2). 

Under the AMA, an appellant can preserve an effective date by continuously pursuing a claim. This is accomplished by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c). In other words, the period under review for the purposes of an increased rating and effective date is the date of receipt of initial claim, if there has been continuous pursuit of the initial claim. 

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held, "TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability." Phillips v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?394 (2024). Because TDIU "is not its own separate benefit that VA can grant or deny unmoored from the underlying service-connection claim or rating," the "eventual effective date depends on the specific claim VA is then adjudicating." Id. at 401. Therefore, although TDIU may be raised in relation to multiple "claim streams" the effective date of a TDIU is determined by which claim stream is being adjudicated. Id. at 401. In other words, the scope of TDIU claims in the AMA system (the relevant period for consideration and hence the effective date), depend on the facts of the case (procedural history) and the relevant claims processing rules - including whether there is an underlying increased rating claim at the time the TDIU is raised.

The claim for TDIU can be filed by VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. Alternatively, when evidence that reasonably raises an issue of unemployability is submitted during an appeal from an assigned disability rating, a claim for entitlement to TDIU will be considered to have been raised by the record as "part and parcel" of the underlying claim. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Additionally, when a TDIU is inferred as part and parcel of an increased rating claim, the appellate period of the TDIU claim runs concurrent with that of the increased rating claim. See Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356 (2018). Finally, it should be noted that TDIU is a rating issue, considered either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim, or as part of a claim for an increased rating. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453; see also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Pursuant to Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, __Vet. App.__(2025), a TDIU application (VA Form 21-8940) may serve as a supplemental claim in the modernized appeal system when it is filed after VA denies an increased rating for ta disability.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.? 38 U.S.C. § 5107?(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 15, 2020, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability. 

The Veteran and his representative contend he is entitled to an effective date earlier than October 15, 2020, for his award of his TDIU.  Specifically, his representative is requesting an effective date of June 8, 2018, because that is the date the Veteran was precluded from work as a result of his service-connected psychiatric disability. See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.   

As an initial matter, the Board will address whether the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  The Veteran filed for entitlement to service connection for PTSD in July 2017.  See July 2017 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The RO denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD in a March 2018 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement in October 2018.   In January 2019, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form and selecting the supplemental claim lane.  In October 2019 the AOJ issued a RAMP supplemental claim decision that denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, in October 2019 and sought readjudication of his claim for entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression.

In a February 2020 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, and awarded a 50 percent evaluation effective October 17, 2019.

In a May 2020 special review rating decision, the RO found that a clear and unmistakable error had been made and assigned a 30 percent evaluation effective July 24, 2017, for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability.  The RO assigned a 50 percent evaluation from September 10, 2019, for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability.

On October 15, 2020, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ and VA Form 21-8940 and identified his service-connected psychiatric disability and obstructive sleep apnea as the disabilities that precluded him from working.  The Veteran reported June 8, 2018, as the day he became too disabled to work.  See October 2020 VA Form 21-8940.

The Board finds that the October 2020 VA Form 21-8940 served as a supplemental claim to the Veteran's underlying increased rating claim for his service-connected psychiatric disability pursuant to the holding in Chisholm.  Therefore, the Board must consider whether the evidence establishes that the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder rendered him unemployable or unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation from the date of his claim for entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder.  

Where the schedular rating is less than total, a total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one ratable at 40 percent or more, and additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.? See 38?C.F.R. §§?3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). 

In the October 2022 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran had not worked since 2018, and that the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU because his combined evaluation for compensation was 70 percent or more, with at least one 40 percent disability, from July 26, 2016. These are?favorable findings?and binding on the Board in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. See?38 C.F.R. § 3.104?(c).

Accordingly, the remaining issue is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded the Veteran from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation prior to October 15, 2020. See?38?C.F.R. §?4.16?(b). 

The central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." See Hatlestead v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?524, 529?(1993). Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See?38?C.F.R. §§?3.341, 4.16, 4.19. 

In Ray v. Wilkie,?31?Vet. App.?58, 72?(2019), the Court held that there are two components to TDIU: one economic and one noneconomic. The economic component considers the Veteran's ability to earn more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) and the noneconomic component considers the Veteran's physical and mental ability to secure or follow substantially gainful employment. Specific physical ability factors include lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory, and visual.?Id.?Specific mental ability factors include memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, getting along with coworkers, and demonstrating reliability and productivity.?Id.  

The fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty finding employment does not alone warrant assignment of an award of individual unemployability, as a high rating itself establishes that his disability makes it difficult for him to obtain and maintain employment. The question of unemployability is ultimately a legal determination for the trier of fact.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Analysis

The Board finds the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of June 8, 2018, but no earlier, for a TDIU due to service-connected major-depressive disorder.

The Veteran underwent an Initial Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) VA examination in September 2017.  He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms were not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication.  The Veteran reported he had lost his job.  His symptoms included depressed mood and anxiety.

In a January 2018 VA treatment note, the Veteran complained of insomnia, depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased energy, anxiety, increased startle response, hypervigilance, and decreased concentration because of nightmares about Hurricane Andrew.  He had recurrent thoughts of Hurricane Andrew with psychological distress, avoidance, and detached feelings.  In February 2018, the Veteran was doing better but still had insomnia.  He was looking for a job and thinking of going back to school.  

The Veteran underwent a mental disorders VA examination in March 2018 and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  His symptoms included anxiety and depressed mood.  

In a December 2018 VA treatment note, the Veteran was noted to be minimally engaging, very tired, and irritable during the encounter.  In March 2019, the Veteran complained about being tired all the time.  He was not doing well in school and had depressed mood and difficult time sleeping because of sleep apnea. Because of his fatigue, he experienced difficulty with motivation and concentration.  He had last worked in June 2018 but was enrolled in college.

The Veteran submitted a private evaluation from Dr. C.L. in January 2019.  Dr. C.L. diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and found that he had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.  The Veteran reported he had previously been fired from a job twice because of poor job performance related to poor memory and difficulty following complex commands. The Veteran's symptoms included panic attacks that occurred more than once a week, near-continuous depression, difficulty in understanding complex commands, obsessional rituals which interfered with routine activities, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene.   She also noted the Veteran had reduced activity, social withdrawal, irritability, fatigue, poor self-esteem, and loss of employment opportunities.  The Veteran submitted an additional private opinion from Dr. C.M. that concurred with Dr. C.L.'s findings.

In April 2019 and June 2019, the Veteran endorsed fluctuating appetite and poor energy and concentration.

In September 2019, the Veteran attended a PTSD VA examination and was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The VA examiner found that he had occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  The Veteran described himself as a loner.  The Veteran endorsed symptoms of anxiety, depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and nightmares.  He explained to the examiner that since January 2018 he had worked daily jobs but could not focus because of his migraines and back pain. He stated he did not have the energy to get out of bed.  

In a November 2019 VA treatment note, the Veteran reported that he tried to work at a concessions center but was unable to keep up with the pace of food preparation because of bilateral arm pain.  He was frustrated he could not sustain employment because of his physical limitations.  Also in November 2019, the Veteran reported that he was working part time as a laborer and cook.  

In January 2020, the Veteran was living with friends, and in April 2020, expressed a desire to work.  He reported that he worried about his ability to sustain employment because he was unemployed due to chronic pain and psychiatric symptoms.  In June 2020, the Veteran reported he had not held a steady job since June 2018 because of migraines, stomach issues, body aches, arm issues, chronic fatigue, and lack of focus.  In December 2020, the Veteran reported symptoms of chronic irritability, avoidance of crowds, and nightmares.

At a December 2020 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The Veteran reported he was not currently working and had last worked full time in June 2018.  The Veteran reported he had previously been fired from a job because he did not socialize enough or communicate well with other individuals.  He attempted to secure employment through temporary employment agencies but had problems with migraines, focusing, and pain.  The Veteran's symptoms included panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, near-continuous depression, flattened affect, disturbances of mood and motivation, and impaired impulse control.

As to the economic component, the evidence shows the Veteran completed high school. He has completed some college.  See CAPRI (receipt date August 20, 2019).  After separation, he worked for an event staffing company and as a cook, janitor, general laborer, and glazier.  See Medical Treatment Records - Furnished by SSA (receipt date December 29, 2020).  The Veteran listed the date he became too disabled to work as June 8, 2018, after which he attempted to work daily jobs, but was unable to continue because of migraines, trouble focusing, and pain.  See December 2020 VA examination.  

Turning to the non-economic factors, the Veteran contends his service-connected major depressive disorder precluded him from working.  The Board finds that, since June 8, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder has prevented him from being able to maintain substantially gainful employment consistent with his educational and vocational background. The Board affords the numerous post-service treatment records significant probative weight as they are based on contemporaneous reports of the Veteran's symptoms. Black v. Brown,?10?Vet. App.?279?(1997).?The Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder caused anxiety, near-continuous depression, panic attacks, irritability, nightmares, and impaired impulse control.  As a result, the Veteran was fired from two jobs because of poor job performance related to poor memory and difficulty following complex commands.  The Veteran attempted temporary employment agencies but was unable to focus.  The Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder precluded him from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation since June 8, 2018.

Accordingly, the effective date of the Veteran's TDIU is the date he became too disabled to work.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?394 (2024); see also October 2020 VA Form 21-8940.  Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an award of individual unemployability due to the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder from June 8, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted.

Additionally, the Board has considered the propriety of referral for extraschedular TDIU for the period prior to July 26, 2016. The Board may not consider a claim for a TDIU during the period when the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirements in the first instance, but will refer it to the Director, Compensation Service, if it is shown that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b). As described in Ray v. Wilkie, the correct standard for referral is whether there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a Veteran is unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities." 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds referral for extraschedular TDIU is not warranted under the reasonable possibility standard as the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that there is a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities in existence at the time. The record does not suggest that he was rendered incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment due to his service-connected disabilities in existence prior to July 26, 2016. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). Moreover, any impairment of function occupationally is compensated for by the ratings assigned for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.15.

Accordingly, referral for extraschedular consideration of TDIU is not warranted. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, however as the evidence persuasively weighs against referral, the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of June 8, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).

The Veteran and his representative contend he is entitled to an effective date earlier than October 15, 2020, for his award of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status. Specifically, his representative is requesting an effective date of June 8, 2018.  See id.  

SMC at the housebound rate is payable when a Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating (to include a TDIU) based on a single service-connected disability and either (i) has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent (or more), separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (ii) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(2). 

(Continued on the next page)

?

The Board finds that SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is warranted effective June 8, 2018, but no earlier.  The Board herein assigned an earlier effective date for the Veteran's award of a TDIU due to a single, service-connected disability effective June 8, 2018.  From December 12, 2017, the Veteran was service connected for obstructive sleep apnea rated at 50 percent; major depressive disorder, multifactorial chronic headache, and pseudofolliculitis barbae rated as 30 percent disabling; and allergic rhinitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disorder rated as 10 percent disabling.  The combined rating on December 12, 2017, was 90 percent.  

From June 8, 2018, the Veteran had a TDIU based on a single, service-connected disability, and had additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability.  For these reasons, the Board finds that?entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC?under?38 U.S.C. § 1114?(s) from June 8, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
