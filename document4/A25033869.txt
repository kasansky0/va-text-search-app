ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus had its onset during military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from May 1981 to March 1987. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In October 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the June 2022 rating decision with submission of VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Notably, remand to the AOJ is only warranted to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating a claim (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion).  38 C.F.R. §20.802 (a).  In addition, the Board is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ, absent clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Now the matter before the Board.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131.  Service connection may also be granted for a disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d). 

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, a combination of sufficient manifestations to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time is required.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  An alternative to showing chronicity in service is a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge.  The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, clarified that this notion of continuity of symptomatology since service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), which is an alternative means of establishing the required nexus or linkage between current disability and service, only applies to conditions identified as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

While tinnitus is not a disease listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a), it is considered an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore chronic disabilities that are subject to presumptive service connection.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A Veteran need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the claimant.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, the Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus as related to noise exposure from weapons training and performing duties as an aerospace ground technician in the military.  See June 2024 VA Form 21-526 EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

As an initial matter, the AOJ made the following favorable findings in the August 2024 rating decision, which are binding on the Board: 1) the Veteran has a current diagnosed disability, and 2) he experienced an event in service, as exposure to hazardous noise is conceded based on his military occupational specialty of aerospace ground equipment mechanic.  Thus, the first two Shedden elements of service connection are met.

As for a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his service, he has provided competent and credible lay reports of tinnitus symptoms that have continued since military service to present.  See e.g., June 2024 VA Form 21-526 EZ.  Indeed, based on those reports, a June 2024 VA examiner found the Veteran had recurrent tinnitus since 1981, which had stayed the same since onset.  Moreover, the Veteran provided an October 2024 lay statement reiterating his contention that his tinnitus symptoms began during service and continued since with no resolution.  

Notably, the June 2024 VA medical examiner provided an unfavorable nexus opinion in both the examination report and a July 2024 TERA (toxic exposure risk activities) medical opinion.  Specifically, the examiner found that because the Veteran had no significant threshold changes or reporting during service, there was an absence of an objectively verifiable noise injury, and a nexus could not exist.  However, the absence of in-service complaint or treatment for tinnitus is not fatal to a claim for service connection.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007) (an examiner cannot base their opinion solely on the absence of in-service corroborating medical records).  As such, the Board finds both the June 2024 medical opinion and July 2024 TERA medical opinion are inadequate for adjudication of the matter and afforded no probative weight. 

Considering the above, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds his tinnitus began during active service and has continued ever since.  As such, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted.
