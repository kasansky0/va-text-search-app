DOCKET NO. 201209-129825
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The Appeal Modernization Act (AMA) appeal, docketed as E 201209-129825, concerning the Veteran's entitlement to Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) benefits for additional education under the provisions of Chapter 31, Title 38 of the United States Code, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On May 13, 2019, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a decision that denied the Veteran's request to pursue additional education under the VR&E program.  On May 20, 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 requesting Higher-Level Review of the AOJ's May 13, 2019, decision.

2. On December 9, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  She indicated that she was appealing a VR&E decision dated March 19, 2020.  She elected the Evidence Submission docket under the modernized appeal review system but did not submit any additional evidence in support of her appeal.  The record does not contain a VR&E decision dated March 19, 2020.  Nevertheless, her appeal was docketed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) as "E 201209-129825."

3. On January 21, 2021, the AOJ issued a Higher-Level Decision that denied the Veteran's claim for additional education under the VR&E program. 

4. On March 1, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  She indicated that she was appealing the January 21, 2021, VR&E decision.  She elected the Board hearing docket under the modernized appeal review system.  Her appeal was docketed by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) as "H 210209-179042."

5. The Veteran testified at a Board hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in July 2024.  Her testimony involved the claim of entitlement to VR&E benefits for additional education.  A transcript of that hearing was associated with the record.

6. AMA Appeal "H 210209-179042" and AMA Appeal "E 201209-129825" both involve the Veteran's claim of entitlement to VR&E benefits for additional education.  Due to their duplicative nature, the Board finds it appropriate to dismiss AMA Appeal "E 201209-129825."

7. AMA Appeal "H 210209-179042" will be addressed in a future Board decision and appellate review will be based on an evidence window that is more favorable to the Veteran than the AMA evidence widow associated with AMA Appeal "E 201209-129825."

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The AMA appeal, docketed as E 201209-129825, concerning the Veteran's entitlement to VR&E benefits for additional education under the provisions of Chapter 31, Title 38 of the United States Code, is moot.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104, 20.1100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2006 to December 2006.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a decision allegedly issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) in March 2020.

By way of background, on May 13, 2019, the AOJ issued a decision that denied the Veteran's request to pursue additional education under the VR&E program.  Specifically, the VRC found that the Veteran had the education necessary to obtain employment as a laboratory technician (or similar position) and that she did not need Master's degree to qualify for suitable employment.

On May 20, 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 requesting Higher-Level Review of the AOJ's May 13, 2019, decision.

In February 2020, the Veteran was placed on an Individualized Employment Assistance Plan (IEAP) for employment services with the program goal of obtaining and maintaining entry level employment as a "lab technician and/or related title or field."  See February 12, 2020, VA Form 28-8872 Rehabilitation Plan; February 12, 2020, VR-67 CH 31 Positive Decision Letter at Plan Development.

On December 9, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  She indicated that she was appealing a VR&E decision dated March 19, 2020.  She elected the Evidence Submission docket under the modernized appeal review system.  A duplicate copy of the VA Form 10182 was received by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on January 5, 2021.

The record does not contain a VR&E decision dated March 19, 2020.  Additionally, it does not appear that the Veteran submitted aby additional evidence in support of her appeal.

On January 21, 2021, the AOJ issued a decision that denied the Veteran's claim for additional education.  Specifically, a Supervisory VRC found that the Veteran was employable in a suitable occupation.  The Supervisory VRC offered the Veteran employment services.  

On March 1, 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  She indicated that she was appealing the January 21, 2021, VR&E decision.  She elected the Board hearing docket under the modernized appeal review system.

In July 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing before a VLJ.  Her testimony involved the claim of entitlement to VR&E benefits for additional education.  A transcript of that hearing was associated with the record.

Based on a comprehensive review of the record, the Board finds that AMA Appeal "H 210209-179042" and AMA Appeal "E 201209-129825" both involve the Veteran's claim of entitlement to VR&E benefits for additional education.  

The Board finds that since the AMA Appeal "H 210209-179042" remains pending, AMA appeal "E 201209-129825" involving the same issue is considered moot and will be dismissed due to no case or controversy.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104, 20.1100.

The claim remaining in the pending AMA appeal "H 210209-179042" will be addressed in a future Board decision and appellate review will be based on an evidence window that is more favorable to the Veteran than the AMA evidence widow associated with Appeal "E 201209-129825."
