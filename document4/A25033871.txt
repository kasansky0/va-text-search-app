REMANDED

Entitlement to payment of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dental care provided on December 6, 2019, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1974 to September 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2020 determination made by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the December 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

1. Payment or Reimbursement Non-VA Dental Care

The Veteran contends that payment or reimbursement is warranted for non-VA dental treatment which occurred on December 6, 2019.  See December 2020 VA form 10182.

The claim was denied due to the AOJ's finding that an authorization number was not submitted on the claim.  See November 2020 Explanation of Payment.  However, the Veteran contends that the authorization number was placed on the claim which was electronically submitted.  See December 2020 VA form 10182. The Board also notes that the Veteran submitted evidence which shows the claim form has an authorization number.  See December 2019 Dental Claim Form.  

However, the Board observes that the record is incomplete.  Specifically, the original claim, claims history, and denial letter are not of record.    

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Also, notice of a VA decision affecting benefits must include, among other things, a summary of the evidence considered by VA, as well as accurate identification of the elements not satisfied leading to a denial. 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (b).

In this case the November 2020 EOP does not provide notice as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  Specifically, the EOP did not provide a summary of the evidence considered, identify any favorable findings, or explain how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision.  Importantly, the AOJ's finding that the claim was submitted without an authorization number is contradicted by the evidence submitted by the Veteran.  

In this case, given the lack of documentation of the Veteran's non-VA dental care claim in the record, combined with the lack of adequate notice to the Veteran, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (b) that his claim for payment or reimbursement had been denied, frustrates Board review of the appeal on the merits.

Considering the foregoing, the Board finds remand is warranted for the AOJ to associate with the electronic claim file all relevant notices, adjudicatory documents, and evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.  If such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.  If the AOJ is unable to locate the decision specified in related to the December 2020 VA Form 10182, the appellant must still be notified in writing of the decision affecting the payment of benefits, as required by 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  The notification must also include findings favorable to the claimant as described in 38 U.S.C. § 5104A.  The AOJ should undertake any development to determine whether care was emergent in nature.

The Veteran is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for additional adjudication.  Should the AOJ deny the claim in whole or in part and the Veteran wishes to continue his appeal before the Board, the Veteran should file an appropriate NOD (VA Form 10182) within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ's readjudication of the claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all relevant notices, adjudicatory documents, and evidence considered in connection with the claim for entitlement to payment for non-VA dental care received on December 6, 2019.

(a.) The record should include (but is not limited to): all notices sent to the appellant informing it of the evidence necessary to constitute a complete claim and the evidence necessary to substantiate the claim; all decisions regarding the claim for payment or reimbursement for dental care; any notice of decision provided to the appellant; any evidence submitted by the appellant in connection with the claim; any relevant VA and private medical records obtained or received in connection with the claim, including any authorizations or referrals for care; and any other relevant documents received or generated related to the claim.

2. If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability.

3. Issue the appellant a notice of the decision on the claim for payment or reimbursement of dental care incurred on December 6, 2019, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. § 5104.
