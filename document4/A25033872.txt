REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from May 1983 to June 1983.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the September 2020 appeal to the Board, the Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020, AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

In April 2024, the Board issued a decision denying the instant claim on the merits. The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In an October 2024 order, the Court granted the parties' joint motion for remand (JMR), thereby vacating the Board's April 2024 decision, and remanding the matter for action consistent with the terms of the JMR. The JMR detailed that the Board erred by not remanding the instant claim, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a), for correction of a pre-decisional error on the part of the AOJ, to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty. More specifically, it was identified that the Veteran was not given notice of his right to a pre-decisional hearing before the AOJ, prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. The parties to the JMR found that in the absence of providing such notice, the VA failed in their duty to assist the Veteran in substantiating his claim. See October 2024, JMR (pgs. 2-4). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1), a veteran is "entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of this chapter before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." In addition, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1), provides that a claimant is entitled to notice concerning such right. Indeed, within the right to fair process, claimants have a right to notice and a right to respond. See Bryant v. Wilkie,33 Vet. App. 43, 46 (2020); Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332, 337-38 (2020).

In addition to the foregoing, the JMR included the parties' agreement that a remand is necessary to obtain a medical opinion that addresses the Veterans' claim for service connection as secondary to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this regard, although the AOJ obtained medical opinions as to direct service connection, there are no adequate opinions of record which address the claim for secondary service connection. 

Accordingly, pursuant to the parties' JMR, the Board finds that a remand is authorized under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a), and given the facts of the instant case, is also necessary to fulfill the requirements of 38 C.F.R. §3.103(b) and (d) and provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a hearing with the RO, as well as to obtain an adequate medical opinion addressing the reasonably raised theory of secondary service connection.

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran and his representative with notice of the right to a hearing before the RO prior to the issuance of a decision on the instant claim, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b) and (d).

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician discussing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed diabetes mellitus, type II, disability. Should the examiner determine that an in-person examination is necessary to fully discuss the questions presented below, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination and complete all tests deemed necessary. The claims file must be made available to, and reviewed by, the examiner. The examiner should provide the following opinions:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the claimed diabetes disability is etiologically related to active service?

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the claimed diabetes disability was caused by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for a service-connected disability, to include as secondary to the service-connected OSA disability and any physical impairment caused by such? 

A complete and detailed rationale must be provided for all opinions expressed.
