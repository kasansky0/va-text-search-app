DOCKET NO. 240927-477149
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2017, for a grant of service connection for coronary artery disease is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

No claim of entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease was received prior to an August 17, 2017, VA Form 21-0996 Intent to File and a formal claim was received within one year of the Intent to File.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 17, 2017, for a grant of service connection for coronary artery disease have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, 3.400, 4.16(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1971 to October 1975.

This decision has been written consistent with the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  In September 2023, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) granted service connection for coronary artery disease prior to August 10, 2022.  The Regional Office (RO), in a January 2024 rating decision, implemented the Board decision and assigned an effective date of August 17, 2017.  The Veteran timely appealed the effective date assigned by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested Direct Review.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted a September 2024 statement that he no longer wanted VA to send communications to the Texas Veterans Commission as they were no longer his designated representative.  They have been removed from all VA correspondence since that time.  

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2017, for a grant of service connection for coronary artery disease

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than August 17, 2017, for the grant of service connection for his coronary artery disease disability.  Specifically, the Veteran asserts that his heart issues have caused other issues for a long time.  See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, dated September 27, 2024.  

Under governing law, the effective date for a grant of compensation will be the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Id.  As relevant herein, a claim or application is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  Unless specifically provided, the effective date will be assigned on the basis of the facts as found.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (a).

Under VA regulation prior to March 2015, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a claimant or the claimant's representative, may be considered an informal claim, provided that it identified the benefit sought.  For claims received on or after March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations governing how to file a claim.  The effect of the amendment was to standardize the process of filing claims, and the forms accepted, to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of claims processing, and to eliminate the concept of informal claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155; 79 Fed. Reg. 57660-01.  However, prior to the effective date of the amendment, an informal claim was any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA.  An informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a claimant "continuously pursues" an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options (such as a supplemental claim) within one year of the issuance of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). However, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

Per history, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File that was received on August 17, 2017.  On May 30, 2018, he submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for service connection for coronary artery disease.  An October 2018 RO rating decision deferred the issue for clarification and a January 2019 RO rating decision denied the claim.  The Veteran appealed to the Board, who in October 2022 remanded the issue for a VA examination and opinion.  In August 2023, the RO granted service connection for coronary artery disease pursuant to the PACT Act effective August 10, 2022.  As the matter of service connection for coronary artery disease prior to August 10, 2022, remained in an appellate status, the Board, in a September 2023 decision granted service connection prior to August 10, 2022.  In a January 18, 2024, rating decision, the RO implemented the Board grant and assigned an effective date of August 17, 2017, the date the Intent to File was received.  In a September 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran indicated he wanted the effective date reviewed.

The record does not show any evidence of a claim, formal or informal, from the Veteran or a representative seeking service connection for coronary artery disease prior to the August 17, 2017, intent to file a claim.  As an intent to file a claim was not submitted or received prior to August 17, 2017, the appropriate effective date for the claim in this appeal that led to the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease prior to August 10, 2022, is August 17, 2017.  The Veteran has alluded to an earlier date of claim based on his belief that his heart issues have caused other issues for a long time.  The Board reminds the Veteran that it is the later of the date of claim or date entitlement arose which controls.  Thus, even if the disorder at issue pre-existed the claim, it is the date of claim that controls in this case.

A review of the record shows that the first intent to file a claim for service connection for coronary artery disease was received at VA on August 17, 2017, with a formal claim received within one year of the intent to file form.  Therefore, the claim for an effective date earlier than August 17, 2017, is not appropriate.

As such, the Board concludes that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2017, for the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease is denied.
