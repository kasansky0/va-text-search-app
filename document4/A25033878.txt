ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for a back condition is remanded.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's tinnitus has been rated the maximum schedular 10 percent rating allowed under Diagnostic Code 6260.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 3.321, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1-4.14, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2002 to September 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran timely appealed the rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  Under direct review, the Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2019).  Therefore, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of March 29, 2024, the date of the notification letter for the rating decision on appeal.  Id.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran contends that an increased rating is warranted for his tinnitus.  

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which assigns ratings based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  The relevant temporal focus for this matter begins March 1, 2023, or one year prior to the date of receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A Veteran is limited to a single disability rating for tinnitus, regardless of whether the tinnitus is unilateral or bilateral.  Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for tinnitus under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260 from September 5, 2007.  As there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular disability rating for tinnitus, his claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent on a schedular basis must be denied.  The law, in particular the regulation governing schedular evaluation of tinnitus, is dispositive of the claim.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

As tinnitus has its own code, Diagnostic Code 6260, no rating by analogy under other codes is permissible; thus, a higher rating under another code provision is not warranted.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2015) (held that where there is a diagnostic code that addresses the particular service-connected disability, to evaluate that disability under another code would constitute impermissible rating by analogy).

Finally, the Board has considered whether extraschedular consideration is warranted for the Veteran's tinnitus.  Extraschedular ratings are a way to compensate veterans for disability symptoms that fall outside the schedular rating criteria.  See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).  Here, the Veteran has only asserted that an increased rating was warranted because her "condition worsened." See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  In other words, the Veteran has not reported experiencing any symptoms that fall outside the rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 6260.  In short, as the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating available under any diagnostic code for tinnitus throughout the appeal period, there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular disability rating, and her claim must be denied.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for a back condition is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy is remanded.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the claims must be remanded to allow the AOJ to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the issuance of the March 2024 rating decision.  The Board sincerely regrets the additional delay caused by this remand but wishes to assure the Veteran that it is necessary for a full and fair adjudication of her claims.

A July 2023 community care request for service consult note indicates that the Veteran received care at Acme Acupuncture Clinic.  The Veteran also reported at her March 2024 VA examination that she gets acupuncture as treatment for her back condition.  However, no such records have been associated with the Veteran's claims file.  On remand, the Veteran should be requested to identify and to authorize the release of those records, and the RO must make reasonable efforts to obtain the records including an initial request and at least one follow-up request if necessary.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(c)(1).  All efforts to obtain updated medical records must be documented.  

The Board finds that the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy is inextricably intertwined with the Veteran's back condition increased-rating claim.  See Henderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 11, 20 (1998), citing Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that two issues are inextricably intertwined when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision on one issue cannot be rendered until the other issue has been considered).  Thus, adjudication of the radiculopathy claim must be deferred.

?

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the Veteran and afford her the opportunity to identify any relevant medical records.  Thereafter, with the Veteran's assistance as appropriate, obtain and associate with the Veteran's electronic claims file the Veteran's private treatment records.  All attempts to obtain these records pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(c)(1) must be documented.
