CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of January 17, 2024, but not earlier, for service connection of asthma, under the PACT Act, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, Pub. L. 117-168.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 1991 to January 2000 and the Air Force from September 12, 2001 to September 16, 2001, from October 2001 to June 2002, from March 2003 to September 2003, from July 2004 to January 2005, from May 2005 to October 2005, from June 2007 to August 2007, from October 2007 to December 2007 and from December 2007 to July 2013.  

On February 8, 2024, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for asthma condition that was denied by RO in an April 2024 rating decision.  In May 2024, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the claim and in August 2024 the RO granted service connection, under the PACT Act, for asthma condition with a 30 percent evaluation from February 8, 2024.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a Direct Review.  Although the Veteran retained the ability change this election as of the time of this decision, the Veteran, through counsel, validly waived his opportunity to do so. See September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (September 2024). The Veteran did indicate that he intended to submit additional argument; however, such argument has not been offered. Id.  Accordingly, the Board will proceed with the adjudication of this appeal consistent with the Veteran's intent and may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal was not considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claim, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of increase initial evaluation for asthma condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

1. Effective date for service connection of asthma condition.

On February 8, 2024, the Veteran filed a claim of service connection for asthma condition that was denied by RO in an April 2024 rating decision.  In May 2024, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the claim.  In August 2024, the RO granted service connection on a presumptive basis, under the PACT Act, for asthma with a 30 percent evaluation from February 8, 2024, the date of the initial claim.  The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022.

The PACT Act was enacted on August 10, 2022.  See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

An effective date of an award of benefits based on a liberalizing law is assigned in accordance with the facts found but is usually not earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g), 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  Additionally, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, retroactive effective dates are allowed, to a certain extent, in cases where an award or increase of compensation is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a).  In such cases, if a claim is reviewed at the request of a claimant received within one year from the effective date of a liberalizing law, benefits may be authorized from the effective date of the law.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(1).  If the claimant's request for review is received more than one year after the effective date of the liberalizing law, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3).  However, the claimant must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or regulation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).  Accordingly, to qualify for an earlier effective date for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a), there must have been evidence of a disability at the time of the effective date of the liberalizing law.

Here, prior to February 8, 2024, the Veteran did not submit a formal or informal claim or intent to file a claim for service connection of asthma condition.  Nevertheless, the RO granted service connection for asthma under the PACT Act.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (3), a claim received more than a year from the effective date of the liberalizing law may authorize benefits if the Veteran meets the criteria for the liberalizing law within a year prior of the date VA receives the claim.  Indeed, the evidence first reveals a diagnosis, treatment and functional impairment for asthma from January 17, 2024.  See VA medical treatment record (January 2024).  Thus, the Veteran met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit and an effective date of January 17, 2024 is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  

As to an effective date earlier than January 17, 2024, the Veteran first filed an application for service connection for asthma condition on February 8, 2024.  Although, the Veteran filed the claim for service connection more than one year after the effective date of the PACT Act, the evidence does not demonstrate a diagnosis, treatment or functional impairment for asthma prior to January 17, 2024.  The evidence indicates the initial reports of asthma condition occurred January 17, 2024.  See VA medical treatment record (January 2024).  Thus, the Veteran did not meet all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit and an earlier effective date than January 17, 2024, is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.  

For the above reasons, the evidence for and against an effective date earlier than January 17, 2024, for service connection of asthma condition is neither evenly balanced nor approximately.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim to this extent and demonstrates the January 17, 2024, effective date is adequate.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application to this extent and an earlier effective date than January 17, 2024, for service connection of asthma condition, is not warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

This appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

2. An initial evaluation more than 30 percent for service-connected asthma condition.

The Veteran's service-connected asthma condition is evaluated as 30 percent disabling under diagnostic code (DC) 6602.  The Veteran seeks a higher initial evaluation.

The Veteran underwent an asthma VA examination in April 2024.  See VA medical examination (April 2024).  However, the examiner did not adequately address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the severity of the Veteran's asthma condition.  Moreover, the examiner did not provide an adequate medical opinion assessing the severity of the Veteran's asthma condition, throughout the appeal.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Consequently, the examination is inadequate and provided minimal probative weight.  

The failure to provide an adequate examination and opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to remedy.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

On remand, the examiner must provide a retrospective medical opinion discussing the severity of the Veteran's service-connected asthma condition, throughout the appeal.  See Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80, 85-86 (2008).  In doing so, the examiner must fully discuss the medical and lay evidence regarding the symptoms and impairment of the Veteran's service-connected asthma condition for the appealed period.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule a VA examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected asthma disability. 

The examiner must review the entire claims file and this remand.

The examiner shall provide a full, retrospective description of the severity of the asthma condition and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability, throughout the appeal period.  

The examiner shall identify all functional impairment, found to be present in the disability.  

In doing so, the examiner must specifically acknowledge and discuss the Veteran's medical history and competent lay reports regarding the severity of the asthma condition. 

If unable to render a medical opinion, provide a statement as to whether there is any additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.  

If the examiner is unable to provide any requested opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why this is so.
