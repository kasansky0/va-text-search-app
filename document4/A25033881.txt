FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most probative and persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's right knee disability resulted in limitation of flexion limited to 60 degrees on October 14, 2022, within one year of his increased rating claim.

2. The most probative and persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's right knee disability resulted in limitation of extension limited to 40 degrees on October 14, 2022, within one year of his increased rating claim.

3. The most probative and persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's right ankle disability resulted in marked limitation of motion on October 14, 2022, within one year of his increased rating claim.

4. The most probative and persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's GERD resulted in persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, which is productive of considerable impairment of health, on October 14, 2022, within one year of his increased rating claim.

5. On October 14, 2022, the Veteran met the schedular requirements for DEA.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1984 to May 1993, to include service in Southwest Asia.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; by law, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2022 rating decision. In April 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR rating decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2022 rating decision.

In an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Dates

Legal Criteria

The general rule for earlier effective dates for service connection provides that if a claim for disability compensation is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement will be either the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).

If a claim is not received within a year of separation, VA regulations provide that the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An effective date for increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred, if application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). "[A]n increase in a veteran's service-connected disability must have occurred during the one-year period prior to the date of the veteran's claim in order to receive the benefit of an earlier effective date." Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a). A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998).

Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

In Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held that "[s]ection 5101(a) is a clause of general applicability and mandates that a claim must be filed in order for any type of benefit to accrue or be paid." Thus, before VA can adjudicate an original claim for benefits, the claimant must submit a written document identifying the benefit and expressing some intent to seek it. See also Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32 (1998).

Right Knee Disability, Right Ankle Disability, and GERD

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran asserted that he was entitled to effective dates earlier than October 28, 2022, for the assignment of a separate rating for his right knee limitation of flexion, an increased rating for his right knee limitation of extension, an increased rating for his right ankle disability, and an increased rating for his GERD. He asserted that he should be assigned effective dates in November 2021, although he asserted no specific reason.

On November 16, 2021, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for his GERD. A February 2022 rating decision continued the assigned 20 percent rating. This claim became final as the Veteran did not file supplemental claim, request higher level review, or request a Board review of this rating decision within one year.

Afterwards, the next communication from the Veteran regarding increased rating claims was on October 28, 2022, when he filed his most recent increased rating claims for his right knee disability, right ankle disability, and GERD.

In addition, he also submitted Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) forms regarding his right knee disability, right ankle disability, and GERD. In each of these DBQs, the Veteran's physician indicated a diagnosis of October 14, 2022, the date the DBQs were signed by his physician.

The Veteran specifically requested that no VA examinations be scheduled as he submitted the private DBQs in support of his claims. Accordingly, the AOJ assigned affective dates of October 28, 2022, the date the Veteran's increased rating claims were received by VA.

However, the evidence of records shows that on October 14, 2022, within one year prior to his increased rating claims, his physician reported worsening of his right knee disability, right ankle disability, and GERD.

As such, the date entitlement arose for the Veteran's increased ratings for his right knee disability, including the assignment of a separate rating for his right knee limitation of flexion, right ankle disability, and GERD was October 14, 2022.

The record contains no evidence prior to October 14, 2022, that would make it factually ascertainable that the Veteran's right knee disability, right ankle disability, or GERD warranted ratings in excess of those assigned.

Accordingly, the criteria are met to establish effective dates of October 14, 2022, for the assignment of a separate noncompensable disability rating for right knee limitation of flexion, a 40 percent disability rating for right knee limitation of extension, a 20 percent disability rating for a right ankle disability, and a 30 percent disability rating for GERD, and the claims are granted.

The Veteran should be aware that under 38 U.S.C. § 5111, payment of monetary benefits based on an award of compensation may not be made before the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective under 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Accordingly, no additional monetary benefit will be due to the Veteran.

DEA

Factual Background and Analysis

For the purposes of DEA benefits, basic eligibility exists for veterans who are (1) discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and (2) in receipt of a permanent and total service-connected disability rating. 38 U.S.C. § 3500; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020.

An effective date of October 14, 2022, is warranted. The Veteran is now in receipt of a 100 percent combined disability rating as of October 14, 2022. As such, the Veteran was also entitled to an effective date of October 14, 2022, for the grant of DEA.

Accordingly, the criteria are met to establish an effective date of October 14, 2022, for the assignment DEA, and the claim is granted.

Again, under 38 U.S.C. § 5111, payment of monetary benefits based on an award of compensation may not be made before the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective under 38 U.S.C. § 5110. Accordingly, no additional monetary benefit will be due to the Veteran.
