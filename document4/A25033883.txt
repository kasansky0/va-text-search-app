ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for painful scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, for a 10 percent rating, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804, is granted from April 27, 2020. 

Entitlement to an increased rating for scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, which is currently 0 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran's painful scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, has been painful from April 27, 2020, but has not been unstable at any time. 

2.  The Veteran's scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal does not measure at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for a rating of 10 percent, but no higher, for painful scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, have been met from April 27, 2020.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, DC 7804.

2.  The criteria for a compensable rating for scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal have not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, DC 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Marine Corps from July 1980 to July 1983 and from December 1983 to September 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which continued the 0 percent rating for a right chest scar.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application in October 2021 seeking an increased evaluation of his right chest scar.  In a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 0 percent rating for a right chest scar.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in March 2023.  In a June 2023 rating decision, a duty to assist error was identified.  In a November 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for painful scar, right flank status post lipoma removal with an evaluation of 10 percent effective October 20, 2022, under DC 7804, and separately, the Veteran's evaluation of scar, right flank status post lipoma removal under DC 7802, was continued at 0 percent disabling.  In November 2023, the Veteran again submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 10 percent evaluation for painful scar, right flank status post lipoma removal under DC 7804, and continued the 0 percent evaluation for scar, right flank status post lipoma removal under DC 7802.

The Veteran timely appealed the March 2024 rating decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 and requesting the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review Lane for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the November 2023 rating decision, as no further development took place after this decision as part of the higher level review process. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.

If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  In view of the number of atypical instances, it is not expected, especially with the more fully described grades of disabilities, that all cases will show all the findings specified.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

When the appeal arises from an initial assigned rating, consideration must be given to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  However, staged ratings are also appropriate in any increased rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Here, analysis in this decision has therefore been undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods as to the pending claim.

In all cases, the Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source.  The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible or worthy of belief.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 308 (2007) (observing that once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible).  The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence in light of the entirety of the record.  In this function, the Board may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (per curiam) (table); see Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (holding that the Board has the "authority to discount the weight and probative value of evidence in light of its inherent characteristics in its relationship to other items of evidence").

The Board has considered all evidence of record as it bears on the issue before it.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) ("Decisions of the Board shall be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record"); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) ("Secretary shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case").  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting these decisions, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record.  The Federal Circuit has held that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the Veteran's appeal.

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increase shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Prior to March 24, 2015, an informal claim was acceptable to establish a service connection claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (repealed 2015).  An informal claim included any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits.  The communication must have identified the benefit sought.  Id.  For a document to be recognized as an informal claim, "there must be a reasonable expectation for VA to act in the manner that the claimant intended."  King v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 464, 470 (2010).  Importantly, identification of the benefit sought need not be explicit in the claim-stating documents but could also be found indirectly through examination of the evidence to which the documents themselves point when sympathetically read.  Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362, 1368 (2019).  The factfinder "must look beyond the four corners" of a claim in sympathetically determining what the claim-stating documents are seeking to obtain.  Id. at 1369.  However, the "mere presence of medical evidence" is not sufficient to indicate intent to apply for service connection or identify the benefit sought.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).  Under the old regulations, the Board also recognizes a Veteran's claim was required to identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation was sought with at least at a high level of generality.  Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).  There was no set form that an informal written claim must take.  All that was required was that the communication indicated an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, and identified the benefits sought.  Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (1999).

Claims filed on or after March 24, 2015, as in this case, must be submitted on the application form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018).  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary (as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a)) appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of the receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1) (2018).

Effective March 24, 2015, the law no longer allows for informal claims.  However, the pertinent regulation allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) (2018).  If submitted in writing, an intent to file must be on a standardized form.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(ii) (mandating that the claim must be "[w]ritten on an intent to file a claim form.  The submission to an agency of original jurisdiction of a signed and dated intent to file a claim, on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose, will be accepted an intent to file a claim.")  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2), "[a]n intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based."  

A claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not of full age or capacity, who indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA, by a communication or action, to include an electronic mail that is transmitted through VA's electronic portal or otherwise, that does not meet the standards of a complete claim is considered a request for an application form for benefits under § 3.150(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary.  Id. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for painful scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, for a 10 percent rating, but no higher, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804, is granted from April 27, 2020. 

The Veteran disagrees with his rating for his for painful scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, which was 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7804 from October 20, 2022.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Unstable or painful scars are evaluated as follows: five or more scars that are unstable or painful (30 percent); three or four scars that are unstable or painful (20 percent); and one or two scars that are unstable or painful (10 percent).  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804. Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (2) allows for an extra 10 percent rating if one or more of the scars are both unstable and painful.  Diagnostic Code 7804, Note (1) defines an unstable scar as "one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar."

38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7800 (2019) pertains to scars of the head, face, or neck and is therefore inapplicable to this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801 (2019) pertains to scars associated with underlying soft tissue damage; a compensable rating under this Diagnostic Code requires that the scars cover at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters).  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802 (2019) pertains to scars not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and provides for a 10 percent rating only if the area affected is 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805 (2019) apply to other scars, including linear scars, and "other effects of scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804."  Diagnostic Code 7805 contains the instruction "Evaluate any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under diagnostic codes 7800-04 under an appropriate diagnostic code."

The Veteran first submitted his intent to file on March 27, 2020.  The Veteran signed the intent to file but failed to select the box indicating the general benefits sought by the Veteran (compensation, pension).  See March 2020 VA 21-0966 Intent to File. 

On April 2, 2020, the VA sent a notification letter to the Veteran informing him that their VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File was incomplete because he did not identify the benefit sought (i.e., compensation, pension, or survivors' pension/Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)).  The letter stated that without this information, the VA was unable to accept the Veteran's intent to file.  See April 2020 Notification Letter (e.g., VA 20-8993, VA 21-0290, PCGL).

While an Intent to File form may preserve the effective date for an award of compensation, unfortunately, the failure to check the box identifying the benefit sought on the intent to file form received on March 27, 2020, is fatal to the preservation of that date as the effective date.  VA regulation explicitly states that the intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit sought, either compensation or pension.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2).  The March 27, 2020, Intent to File form failed to provide this information.  The AOJ properly advised the Veteran that the form was invalid and not accepted as an intent to file a claim in an April 2, 2020, letter.  The Veteran was advised of the proper procedures to follow in the April 2, 2020, letter, which was mailed to the Veteran's address on file.  The Veteran's address on file matches the address provided on the Veteran's March 27, 2020, intent to file and was not returned as undeliverable.  See April 2020 Notification Letter (e.g., VA 20-8993, VA 21-0290, PCGL). 

Subsequently, on April 27, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  In a letter of support submitted with his claim, the Veteran asserted that his scar ached if he put pressure on it, and this pain caused him to avoid lying on his side and reaching with his arm.  See April 2020 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted a letter from a private doctor, which stated that the Veteran should receive a 10 percent rating for his scar.  The physician noted that the Veteran stated that his scar was painful, and that the current 0 percent rating for his scar was erroneous.  See October 2022 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

The Veteran was first afforded a VA exam for his scar in October 2020.  The examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with scar, right flank, midline, horizontal, s/p lipoma removal in 1999.  The scar was noted as 5 cm by .1cm.  The examiner noted that the scar was not painful; however, the examiner did not offer any support for this finding, and did not explain why the Veteran previously claimed the scar was painful, but did not report pain during the examination.  As no support was offered by the examiner for the statement that the scar was not painful, the October 2020 VA examination is afforded no probative weight.  See C&P Exam, October 2020.

The Veteran was afforded a second VA examination for his scar in July 2023.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with flank/right lateral side, well healed horizontal scar; s/p removal of a lipoma in 1999.  One painful scar was noted, and the Veteran reported that it hurt when he bumped against it and the pain would sometimes wake him up from his sleep.  No scars were noted as unstable with frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar.  No scars were due to burns.  The anterior trunk was the only body region affected with one scar of 5 cm by .2 cm in length.  The total area of the scar was 1 cm.  The functional loss was noted as "The Veteran stated that he can not pick up anything heavy on the right side as it will cause the scar to hurt. Veteran reports that he cannot sleep on the right side due to the tenderness of the scar."  See July 2023 C&P Exam. 

The Board finds that the July 2023 VA scar examination was probative in showing that the Veteran did have dull pain in his scar.  Therefore, based on the totality of the Veteran's medical and lay evidence and resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds the Veteran's disability picture most closely approximates a 10 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804 from April 27, 2020, the date the Veteran submitted his VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation).  However, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Veteran had more than two painful scars or that his scars were unstable.  Additionally, no scars were associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Therefore, a 10 percent rating under DC 7804 is the maximum rating available to the Veteran for his scar.

Entitlement to an increased rating for scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, which is currently 0 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802, is denied.

The Board notes that the Veteran has been rated by the AOJ as having two separate scar ratings.  The Veteran has been rated for a painful scar, right flank status post lipoma removal, rated at 10 percent disabling from October 20, 2022, under DC 7804.  The Veteran is also rated for scar, right flank status post lipoma removal, rated at 0 percent disabling from October 1, 2003, under DC 7802.  Both ratings are for the same scar, as the Veteran has been shown by VA examiners to only have one right flank scar.  See July 2023 C&P Exam, November 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

Disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are generally rated separately before ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.   VA is prohibited from pyramiding (rating the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes).  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  When disabilities have duplicative or overlapping symptoms, the rule against pyramiding prohibits VA from compensating the Veteran more than once for the same symptom or impairment.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017).

Under DC 7802, burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are superficial and nonlinear in an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrant a 10 percent evaluation.  Note (2) under that code provides that if multiple qualifying scars are present, assign a separate evaluation for each affected extremity based on the total area of the qualifying scars that affect that extremity.

On review, the Board finds that a compensable rating pursuant to DC 7802 is not warranted.  In this regard, the right flank s/p lipoma removal scar measured 1 square centimeter, which does not more nearly approximate a compensable rating (at least 39 square centimeters) regardless of the evidence of soft tissue damage during the examination.  See July 2023 C&P Exam.   

Because the Board considered the applicable ratings under every Diagnostic Code pertaining to scars, as shown in the preceding section of this decision, the Board finds that there are no other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes by which a higher rating can be assigned.  The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating for scar, right flank s/p lipoma removal, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802 in excess of 0 percent at any time during the period on review.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
