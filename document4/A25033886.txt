ORDER

An initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected history of nephrolithiasis status post right ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy cytoscopy (claimed as kidney stones with recurring stones and surgery) (hereinafter "kidney stones") is denied.

An initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected right flank scar, residual of kidney stone right ureter removal (claimed as scars from kidney stones) (hereinafter, "right flank scar") is denied.

An initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected gastritis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's kidney stones disability is manifested by diet therapy and invasive or non-invasive procedures 0 to 1 time per year. 

2. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's right flank scar is manifested by one scar measuring approximately 27.5 centimeters by 0.8 centimeters, for which the competent medical evidence indicates is not painful or unstable. 

3. For the entire appeal period, symptoms of the Veteran's gastritis have manifested in no more than a history of disease documented by endoscopy or diagnostic imaging studies. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected kidney stones are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115b, Diagnostic Codes 7508, 7509. 

2. The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected right flank scar are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802. 

3. The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for the service-connected gastritis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.10, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7307, 7304. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1977 to July 1983.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2023 and September 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decisions.  In the August 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for kidney stones and assigned an initial noncompensable disability rating effective from February 24, 2023, and granted service connection for a right flank scar and assigned an initial noncompensable disability rating effective from February 24, 2023.  In the September 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for gastritis and assigned an initial noncompensable disability rating effective from February 24, 2023

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal (regarding kidney stones and right flank scar), and the September 2023 rating decision on appeal (regarding gastritis).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, the appeal period before the Board stems from the Veteran's February 24, 2023, Fully Developed Claim, plus the one-year look-back period as the claim is an increased rating claim.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Increased Ratings 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Staged ratings must be considered and are appropriate when the evidence establishes that the claimed disability manifested symptoms that warrant different ratings for distinct time periods during the appeal.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).  See also Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999) (applying this concept to initial ratings).  

It is the Board's responsibility to determine whether the totality of the probative evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim or whether the evidence is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event; or whether this evidence persuasively weighs again the claim, in which case the claim must be denied.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021)

Kidney Stones 

The Veteran asserts his service-connected kidney stone disability warrants an initial compensable disability rating.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's kidney stone disability has been rated as noncompensable pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7508.  

Diagnostic Code 7508 directs that nephrolithiasis/ureterolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis are to be rated as hydronephrosis under Diagnostic Code 7509, except for recurrent stone formation requiring invasive or non-invasive procedures more than two times per year.  If evaluated under this code, the rating assigned will be 30 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7508.  This is the only schedular rating available under the diagnostic code.

Under Diagnostic Code 7509, a 10 percent rating is assigned for only an occasional attack of colic, not infected and not requiring catheter drainage.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for frequent attacks of colic, requiring catheter drainage.  A 30 percent maximum schedular rating is assigned for frequent attacks of colic with infection (pyonephrosis), kidney function impaired.  The rating criteria directs that severe hydronephrosis is to be rated as renal dysfunction.

The words "recurrent," "occasional," "frequent," and "severe" are not defined in the rating schedule.  For purposes of this decision, "recurrent" is defined as returning or happening time after time.  "Occasional" is defined as encountered, occurring, appearing, or taken at irregular or infrequent intervals.  "Frequent" is defined as common, usual, happening at short intervals.  "Severe" is defined as very painful or harmful, or of a great degree.  See Webster's New College Dictionary (3rd ed. 2008).

The most pertinent evidence of record includes treatment records, a June 2023 VA Urinary Tract examination and a September 2023 VA Kidney examination.

Treatment records show the Veteran used a catheter in October 2019, however, this is not within the period on appeal as the catheter use predates February 24, 2022.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

During the June 2023 VA Urinary Tract examination, the Veteran reported occasional nocturia, 1-2 times per night, but denied urinary frequency, hesitancy, dysuria, or hematuria.  See C&P Exam, June 2023.  With respect to voiding function, the Veteran reported nighttime awakening to void two times.  Id. 

Upon examination, during the September 2023 VA Kidney examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's recurrent kidney stones.  The kidney stones treatment required diet therapy and invasive or non-invasive procedures 0 to 1 time per year.  See C&P Exam, September 2023.

Neither VA examination showed any evidence of renal colic or required catheter drainage.  See C&P Exam, June 2023; C&P Exam, September 2023.

The Veteran is competent to describe certain observable symptoms associated with his disabilities.  The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and are contemplated by the disability ratings that have been assigned.  Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the symptoms of the service-connected disabilities at issue.  As such, the Veteran's lay reports concerning matters that he is competent to address, do not, in this case, outweigh the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected conditions at issue.

In sum, the Veteran's kidney stone symptoms did not manifest in recurrent stone formation requiring invasive or non-invasive procedures more than two times per year, nor manifest as only an occasional attack of colic, not infected and not requiring catheter drainage.  

Accordingly, the Veteran's kidney stone disability does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent, or higher, rating.  As the criteria for a 10 percent rating are not met under diagnostic code 7508 or 7509, a compensable rating is not warranted at this time.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Codes 7508, 7509.

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence is decidedly against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Right Flank Scar

The Veteran asserts his service-connected right flank scar warrants an initial compensable disability rating.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's right flank scar has been rated as noncompensable pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.  

Diagnostic Code 7802 pertains to burn scar or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  A maximum 10 percent rating is provided for scar(s) involving an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater.  No other rating is provided by this Diagnostic Code.  

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating for five or more scars that are unstable of painful. Note (1) provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA scar examination in June 2023.  The Veteran's right flank scar was not painful or unstable and did not have a total area equal or greater than 39 square centimeters (22 square inches).  The right flank scar measured 27.5 centimeters by 0.8 centimeters.  See C&P Exam, June 2023.

There is no evidence to suggest the Veteran's scar is painful or unstable. 

In this case, the Veteran's scar area does not rise to the level necessary for a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Codes 7801 or 7802.  Likewise, as the Veteran's single right flank scar has been found to be neither unstable nor painful, a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804 is equally not warranted in this case.  Thus, a compensable rating for the Veteran's right flank scar is not warranted at this time.  

In reaching this conclusion, the evidence is not in approximate balance or relative equipoise, and therefore the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Gastritis 

The Veteran asserts his service-connected gastritis warrants an initial compensable disability rating.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's gastritis has been rated as noncompensable pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7307.  

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for the digestive system during the claim period, effective May 19, 2024.  The Veteran's claim in this case was pending prior to the May 19, 2024, effective date of the new criteria, and therefore, the Board will consider both the previous and current criteria and apply the more favorable criteria.

Prior to May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7307 provides a 10 percent rating for chronic gastritis with small nodular lesions, and symptoms; a 30 percent rating for chronic gastritis with multiple small eroded or ulcerated areas, and symptoms, which rates hypertrophic gastritis (identified by gastroscope); a maximum disability rating of 60 percent is warranted for chronic gastritis with severe hemorrhages, or large ulcerated or eroded areas.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7307. 

From May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7307 instructs to rate chronic gastritis as peptic ulcer disease under Diagnostic Code 7304.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7307.   Diagnostic Code 7304 provides for a noncompensable rating for history of peptic ulcer disease documented by endoscopy or diagnostic imaging studies; a 20 percent rating for episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, that: last for at least three consecutive days in duration, occur three times or less in the past 12 months, and are managed by daily prescribed medication; a 40 percent rating for episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, that: last for at least three consecutive days in duration, occur four or more times in the past 12 months, and are managed by daily prescribed medication; a 60 percent rating for continuous abdominal pain with intermittent vomiting, recurrent hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (tarry stools), and manifestations of anemia which require hospitalization at least once in the past 12 months; and a maximum 100 percent rating for post-operative for perforation or hemorrhage, for three months.

The most pertinent evidence of record includes a September 2023 VA stomach examination and treatment records.

During the September 2023 VA stomach examination, the Veteran reported that he continues to have intermittent episodes of diarrhea, bloating and nausea if he eats acidic or spicy food which he treats with Pepcid but did not indicate such symptoms lasting up to three days.  The examiner found the Veteran did not suffer any signs or symptoms of a stomach disorder.  In this regard, the examiner found the Veteran did not suffer any functional impact from his gastritis.  As to imaging, there were no signs of erosions or ulcers.  See C&P Exam, September 2023.

The Veteran is competent to describe certain observable symptoms associated with his disabilities.  The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and are contemplated by the disability ratings that have been assigned.  Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the symptoms of the service-connected disabilities at issue.  As such, the Veteran's lay reports concerning matters that he is competent to address, do not, in this case, outweigh the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected conditions at issue.

In sum, the Veteran's gastritis did not manifest in chronic gastritis with small nodular lesions and symptoms; nor did it manifest in episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, that last for at least three consecutive days in duration, occur three times or less in the past 12 months, and are managed by daily prescribed medication.

Accordingly, the Veteran's gastritis does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent, or higher, rating.  As the criteria for a compensable rating under the former and current diagnostic code 7307 are not met, a compensable rating is not warranted at this time.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7307.
