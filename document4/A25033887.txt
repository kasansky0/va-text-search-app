REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1977 to September 1977.  

The matter of service connection for psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

By contrast, the Veteran's claims for service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness, right ankle swelling and edema, sciatica of the left lower extremity, headaches, and joint stiffness, stem from the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions.   

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the notice of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. §?20.301.??

7. Entitlement to service connection for headaches is dismissed.  

8. Entitlement to service connection for joint stiffness is dismissed.  

In his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested that the Board review denials of claims for service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness, right ankle swelling and edema, sciatica of the left lower extremity, headaches, and joint stiffness, referencing the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions, respectively as the dates of those decisions.  

Governing law and regulations for both legacy and AMA appeals provide claimants with one year following the date of mailing of notification of a decision by the AOJ in which to contest the decision via a Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52(a), 20.203(b). 

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board has jurisdiction over claims it has docketed, but may dismiss appeals due to procedural defects, such as noncompliance with claims processing rules.  In Dunham v. McDonough, No. 23-3014, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 418 (March 26, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.), the Court interpreted Hall to say that the Board may enforce the requirements for a NOD, but that if it dismisses a Veteran's claim the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration and any other relevant factors.  See also Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain). 

In Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 269 (2024), the Court clarified that, while the one-year deadline in 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b) to file an NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to the Board's review of a claim, "it is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule."  Therefore, the Court held, "The Board thus erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Mr. Ferko's appeal because his NOD was not filed within section 7105(b)'s one-year period.  This doesn't mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant.  It is an 'important and mandatory' component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule.  Henderson, 562 U.S. at 435.  Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the 'mandatory claim-processing rule' is properly invoked, it 'must be enforced.'  Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017).  Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness." 

For the following reasons, the issues must be dismissed for noncompliance with claims processing regulations. 

In this case, the issues identified by the Veteran in the NOD, which was received on August 12, 2024, were adjudicated in rating decisions issued prior to August 2023, as follows: in February 2010, the AOJ issued a rating decision in which the claims for service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness, right ankle swelling and edema, headaches, and joint stiffness, were denied; in April 2013, the AOJ issued a rating decision in which the previous denials for service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness, and right ankle swelling and edema, were continued, and the claim for service connection for sciatica of the left lower extremity was denied.   

For the following reasons, the claims for entitlement to service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness right ankle swelling and edema, sciatica of the left lower extremity, headaches, and joint stiffness, that have been docketed at the Board must be dismissed based on noncompliance with the relevant claims processing regulations, specifically the regulation regarding the timeliness of the NOD.  38 U.S.C.             § 7105(b)(1)(C) ("A question as to timeliness or adequacy of the notice of disagreement shall be decided by the Board").  

First, there is no rating decision addressing these or any other issues that was issued within a year prior to the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  Moreover, for the matters identified by the Veteran in his NOD, there is no indication from the Board's review of the record that the Veteran was not appropriately notified about the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions and his right to appeal. 

The evidence of record with specific consideration to the Veteran's statements in connection with the instant appeal do not reasonably raise any issue of notification deficiency as to issuance of the above rating decisions and right to appeal.  Cf. Cook v. Principi, 318 F. 3d 1334, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  Thus, further consideration of a time extension based upon inadequate notification is not warranted for any of these matters.  See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("where a fully developed record is presented to the Board with no evidentiary support for a particular theory of recovery, there is no reason for the Board to address or consider such a theory"). 

The Veteran has not specifically requested an extension of time to file a NOD or otherwise asserted good cause under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) for not filing a timely NOD and to consider an extension of time exception to the one-year time limit for appealing these claims.  Cf. Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 272 ("the Board must determine whether Mr. Ferko has shown good cause for, and otherwise demonstrated entitlement to, an extension of the NOD-filing deadline under                                 § 3.109(b)").  Moreover, although the Board is required to liberally read the NOD to include consideration of misidentification of the date of the decision being appealed, there is no evidence or argument that there was a rating decision issued on these or any other matters within a year prior to the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a) ("The Board will construe [arguments identifying the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees] in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal"); VA Claims and Appeals Modernization, 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 152 (Fed. Reg. Jan. 18, 2019)  ("§ 20.202 notes that '[t]he Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal.' This language protects the rights of a veteran who, for example, incorrectly identifies the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision but does provide enough information that VA is able to identify the issue and decision on appeal"). 

In addition, VA has not taken any action with regard to these claims, such as accepting hearing testimony or an extension request, that would lead the Veteran to believe these claims were not subject to the one year time limit requirement for filing a NOD as stated in the appeal notices, and there is otherwise no basis for waiver or forfeiture.  Ferko, 137 Vet. App. at 269 (noting that "a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture").  

Further, the Board notes that the Veteran contends that his "witness information," was not considered by the RO in the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182; see also August 2023 VA Form 21-0781 (citing the March 2012 R.H. Buddy Statement as not being considered in previous denials).  

Although there is an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting a decision, there is no requirement that VA discuss all evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf in detail.  Rather, the analysis will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000), Timberlake v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?122, 128-30 (2000).  Moreover, the presumption is that the RO considers all evidence of record.  

Here, the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions did consider all evidence of record including the March 2012 R.H. Buddy Statement in the April 2013 decision, and these decisions became final.  Rating decisions are final, and binding based on evidence on file at the time the claimant is notified of the decision and may not be revised on the same factual basis except by a duly constituted appellate authority.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a).  The claimant has one year from notification of a RO decision to initiate an appeal by filing a notice of disagreement with the decision, and the decision becomes final if an appeal is not perfected within the allowed time period.  38 U.S.C. § 7015; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.106(d), 20.302. Generally, a final rating decision or Board decision may not be reopened and allowed, and a claim based on the same factual analysis may not be considered.  38 U.S.C.         §§ 7104, 7105.  Here, the Veteran's August 2024 VA Form 10182 was not within a year of the February 2010 and April 2013 rating decisions.  Further, additional evidence was not presented to warrant the claims to be reopened and considered.  

For the above reasons, the Veteran's August 2024 VA Form 10182 was untimely as to the matters of service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness right ankle swelling and edema, sciatica of the left lower extremity, headaches, and joint stiffness, and there is no basis to waive this claim-processing rule violation or otherwise address these claims on the merits.  Thus, the appeal from the denials of the claims for entitlement to service connection for back disability, mental psychiatric nervous condition, right foot broken toe trauma, knee stiffness right ankle swelling and edema, sciatica of the left lower extremity, headaches, and joint stiffness must be dismissed.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is remanded.  

The Board has identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error necessitating remand for additional development prior to appellate review.  See 38 C.F.R. §?20.802(a); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). 

The Veteran contends that his psychiatric disorder, claimed as PTSD, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to his experiences in service.  The Veteran contends that his symptoms started in-service and referenced the March 2012 R.H. Buddy Statement, discussing an incident at Fort Campbell, and the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also August 2023 VA Form 21-0781.  

As an initial matter, the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD is recharacterized to include all psychiatric disorders reasonably raised by the record.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination with regard to this claim.   Importantly, VA is required to provide a claimant with a medical examination or opinion when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim.? See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81-82 (2006).? 

Here, the?McLendon?elements are satisfied; there is competent evidence of a current disability or symptoms of a disability, evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, an indication that the disability may be associated with the Veteran's service, but insufficient competent medical evidence on file to make a decision on the claim.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; August 2022 VA Form 21-0781; see also March 2012 VA Form 21-4138 R.H. Buddy Statement.  

As such, the Board finds a pre-decisional duty to assist error to the extent that the RO failed to discharge its duty to assist by not affording the Veteran VA examinations to ascertain the nature, extent, severity, and onset of the Veteran's psychiatric condition claim.  38 U.S.C. §?5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §?20.802(a). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA psychiatric examination (or telehealth interview, review of the record, etc., if an in-person examination is not feasible) to determine the nature, onset and etiology of his psychiatric disability.  The claims file should be reviewed by the examiner. 

All appropriate tests deemed necessary should be administered. 

Based on a review of the record and examination of the Veteran, the examiner should provide an opinion that responds to the following: 

Please identify (by medical diagnosis) each of the Veteran's psychiatric disorders.  A diagnosis of PTSD must be ruled in or excluded. 

As to each psychiatric diagnosis found to be present, the examiner should opine as to the likelihood that such disorder is related to or had its onset in service.  

The examiner must provide a rationale for all opinions expressed. 

It is not sufficient to base an opinion on mere lack of documentation of complaints in service or post-service treatment records.

If unable to provide a medical opinion, provide a statement as to whether there is any additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.
