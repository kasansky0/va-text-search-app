ORDER

Entitlement to service connection to bilateral pes planus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's preexisting bilateral pes planus was aggravated by active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral pes planus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1137, 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from July 1994 to July 1998.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. A Veteran is presumed to be in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious and manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service. Only such conditions as are recorded in the examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304. 

The presumption of soundness attaches only where there has been an induction examination in which the later complained-of disability was not detected. See Bagby v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 225, 227 (1991). The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b) clarify that the term "noted" denotes "[o]nly such conditions as are recorded in the examination reports" and that "[h]istory of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions." See Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994); See also Contant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116 (2003).

When no preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, a Veteran is presumed to have been found sound upon entry. The burden then falls on the Government to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service. If this burden is met, then the Veteran is not entitled to service connection benefits. However, if the Government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under section 1111, the Veteran's claim is one for service connection. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection to bilateral pes planus.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral pes planus condition. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (July 2022). 

The Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral pes planus. However, the AOJ denied service connection because this condition existed prior to the Veteran's military service. See Rating Decision - Narrative (January 2024). 

The Veteran's August 1996 physical examination for enlistment revealed that the Veteran was diagnosed with mild asymptomatic pes planus. See STR - Medical - Photocopy (February 2002); see also C&P Exam (August 2023). Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to the presumption of soundness as to pes planus. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the preexisting pes planus was aggravated, i.e., permanently increased in severity, beyond its natural progression during active service.

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active service where there is an increase in disability during service. Where the evidence shows that there was an increase in disability during service, there is a presumption that the disability was aggravated by service. To rebut the presumption of aggravation, there must be clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) that the increase in severity was due to the natural progress of the disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. The presumption of aggravation is not applicable unless the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service. See Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 402 (1995); see also Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups of symptoms of a condition, alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence of aggravation unless the underlying condition worsened. See Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). Thus, "a lasting worsening of the condition" that is, a worsening that existed not only at the time of separation but one that still exists currently is required. See Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529, 538 (1996).

The Veteran reported that he experienced worsening foot pain throughout active duty. He took aspirin at the time to manage his symptoms. The Veteran reported difficulty even walking at times. After service, he suffered functional limitations due to his foot pain and he gained weight. He reported that he continues to experience limiting foot pain. See VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension (August 2012). 

Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). Here, the Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms, when they began, and their progressive nature. Moreover, the Veteran's lay statement regarding his pes planus symptoms are credible. Thus, the Veteran's lay statements are probative evidence demonstrating his preexisting pes planus increased in severity during active service.

Because the preexisting pes planus has been shown to have increased in severity during active service, the presumption of aggravation as to bilateral pes planus attaches. It is now necessary to determine if the presumption has been rebutted.

The Veteran's records were reviewed by a private medical expert in June 2022. That medical expert noted that the Veteran experienced bilateral pes planus with functional loss, bilateral pain in the feet, swelling, and pain with manipulation. The Veteran experienced less movement than normal bilaterally. See Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) - Veteran Provided (June 2022). 

The Veteran attended a VA examination in August 2023. The Veteran reported bilateral flare-ups of foot pain with exercise. He reported intermittent pain 5 days a week bilaterally. The Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral pes planus, plantar fasciitis, and hammer toes. See C&P Exam (August 2023). The Board finds the above examination findings highly probative as they contain clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's preexisting bilateral pes planus was shown to be asymptomatic at service entrance but has since become productive of bilateral foot pain which has persisted to the present day. The record does not encompass clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) that such increase was due to the natural progress of the disability. Therefore, the presumption of aggravation has not been rebutted.

The Board notes that the evidence contains an opinion adverse to the claim. Specifically, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's pes planus was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by his active duty. The examiner reasoned that there was a lack of evidence to show progression of the Veteran's symptoms beyond natural progression. However, a lack of evidence is not clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) that the Veteran's symptomatic progression due to the natural progress of the disability. Additionally, the VA examiner failed to consider the Veteran's competent lay statements regarding the progression of his symptoms. For these reasons, the opinion is inadequate and afforded minimal probative weight. 

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the claim and shows the Veteran's preexisting bilateral pes planus was aggravated during active service. Therefore, service connection for bilateral pes planus is warranted.
