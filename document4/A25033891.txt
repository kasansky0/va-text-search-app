ORDER

Service connection for Bell's palsy is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had Bell's palsy at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for Bell's palsy have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from April 2019 to March 2022.  An initial rating decision was issued in November 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In his February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection for Bell's palsy

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of Bell's palsy and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

For reference, Bell's palsy is unilateral facial paralysis of sudden onset, due to lesion of the facial nerve and resulting in characteristic distortion of the face.  See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1386 (31st ed. 2007).  A September 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of Bell's palsy.  During the examination, the Veteran reported being diagnosed with the condition at William Beaumont Army Medical Center (WBAMC) in 2021.  A review of his service treatment records does not show a diagnosis of Bell's palsy.  However, the Veteran was diagnosed with ulnar nerve palsy at WBAMC in July 2021.  The ulnar nerve relates to the hand.  See Dorland's at 1280.  The examiner noted this in the remarks section of the examination report and suggested the possibility that the contention of Bell's palsy was submitted erroneously.  The Veteran went on to state that his symptoms improved with medication, but he could not clearly state what his symptoms were.

The Veteran's post-service VA treatment records show a history of Bell's palsy.  However, this appears to be based solely on the statements provided by the Veteran.  There is no diagnosis of Bell's palsy documented in the records.

The Board has considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), which held that pain alone, without a diagnosis of a disease, can qualify as a disability if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.  In this case, the September 2022 VA examination and the Veteran's VA treatment records revealed no signs or symptoms relating to a facial or cranial nerve condition.

To the extent that the Veteran has asserted the presence of a Bell's palsy diagnosis, he has not shown the necessary medical knowledge or expertise to provide a competent diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education of pathology and the facial or cranial nerves. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which shows no diagnosis to be present.
