ORDER

The request for a waiver of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 35 ) was timely received.  To that extent, the appeal is GRANTED. 

Entitlement to a waiver of the recovery of an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 is REMANDED. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. VA's Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Appellant of an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 in December 2021.

2. The Appellant first submitted a timely request for waiver of such overpayment in January 2022, within 180 days from notification.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for filing a timely request for waiver of an overpayment of VA pension benefits are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b). 

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1984 to October 1985.  The Veteran died in September 2021.  The Appellant is his surviving spouse. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC) decision that denied the Appellant's request for a waiver after finding that it was received over 180 days from notification of indebtedness.  

In the June 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision.   

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I

Whether a request for a waiver of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 wad timely filed

The issue on appeal stems from a March 2023 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness issued by the DMC, which denied a February 2023  request for a waiver of indebtedness as it was submitted more than 180 days from the date of notification of the indebtedness.  

A review of the record shows that the Appellant received educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 for two 2021 Fall trimesters at Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi.  One trimester from August 23, 2021 through October 9. 2021, and the second trimester from October 11, 2021 through December 4, 2021.  In November 2021, Belhaven University notified VA via Change of Notice in Student Status (VA Form 22-1999b) that the Appellant preregistered but never attended the second trimester.  The school withdrew the Appellant's enrollment effective October 10, 2021, the day before the beginning the second trimester.   

On November 10, 2021, the Appellant was notified that benefits were stopped effective October 10, 2021, creating the overpayment that is the subject of this appeal.  The Appellant was advised that the DMC will provide her with detailed information about the amount of the debt in a separate letter.  

On December 1, 2021, the DMC first notified the Appellant of the overpayment in the total calculated amount of $1,201.63.  A second letter was mailed in April 2022, and a third letter mailed in January 2023.  

In January 2022, following notification of the first DMC letter, the Appellant submitted a request via email for a waiver of the overpayment to the DMC.   The email correspondence contained an attached letter in which the Appellant explained that she was requesting a waiver for several reasons, to include, in pertinent part, the passing of her husband, the Veteran, in September 2021, before the beginning of the school term in question and the psychological effect of her loss.                  

In February 2022, the AOJ replied to the Appellant's email correspondence explaining the underlying cause of her overpayments.   However, there is no acknowledgement of this waiver request in the record.  

A request for waiver of an indebtedness shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness to the debtor.  The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrates, as a result of error by either the VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing. 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. § 1.963(b).

As the record establishes that the Appellant requested a waiver of overpayment in January 2022, well before the 180-day deadline following the December 2021 first notice of indebtedness, the Board finds that the Appellant properly requested waiver of overpayment within 60 days of the DMC debt letter.

Therefore, the Appellant's request for a waiver of indebtedness is timely.  To this limited extent only, as to timeliness of the request, the claim is granted.  

II

Entitlement to a waiver of the recovery of an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35

Remand is needed to correct pre-decisional duty-to-assist and due process errors. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.801(a), 20.802(a).  

Prior to the March 2023 decision on appeal, the Appellant submitted a timely waiver request not considered by COWC.  Additionally, the January 22, 2022, waiver request e-mail mentioned an "attached VA Form 5655" (Financial Status Report) which is not associated with the record.  And the March 2023 decision refers to a February 2023 waiver request that is not associated with the record.  A remand is required to allow VA to associate these records with the claims file.

Additionally, the issue of whether a waiver of the recovery of an overpayment of VA educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35 is warranted falls within the province of the COWC in the first instance. 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.911(c), 1.962.  Since the Board has found that the request for a waiver was timely received, a remand is necessary for COWC to issue a decision on the merits of the waiver of overpayment request in the first instance. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions: 

1. Associate with the claims file the January 22, 2022 Financial Status Report and the February 2023 waiver request packet referred to in the March 2023 decision with the record.

2. Thereafter, adjudicate the January 2022 waiver request on the merits.
