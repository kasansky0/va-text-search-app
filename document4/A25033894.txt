REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, claimed as a penile condition, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from July 1988 to November 1992.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection - Erectile Dysfunction

The Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is related to his active service. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his erectile dysfunction is related to his service-connected right knee disability. See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2023. During the examination, the Veteran reported that the onset of his erectile dysfunction occurred during his active service, "with loss of ability to sustain an erection during sexual intercourse." The examiner confirmed the Veteran's erectile dysfunction diagnosis, but opined it was less likely than not caused by his right knee disability.

The Board finds that the July 2023 medical opinion is inadequate for adjudication purposes. The examiner failed to provide an opinion regarding the Veteran's direct service connection claims or address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his erectile dysfunction. Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020); see also Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545 (2008). As for the secondary service connection claims, the examiner likewise failed to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability aggravated his erectile dysfunction. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013). 

The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that requires corrective action. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Accordingly, remand is warranted to obtain a new medical opinion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an examiner with appropriate expertise to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed erectile dysfunction. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.

Based on the examination results and review of the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the claimed erectile dysfunction had its onset during the Veteran's active service or is otherwise etiologically related to such service. In forming the opinion, the examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of his symptoms.

The examiner should also provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any currently present erectile dysfunction was caused by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for a service-connected disability, to include any medication prescribed for treatment of such.

A rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.
