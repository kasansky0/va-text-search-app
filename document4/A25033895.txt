DOCKET NO. 241024-485522
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for restorations following the proposed reductions for the ratings for 1. unspecified depressive disorder, with anxious distress (acquired psychiatric disorder) (proposed rating reduction from 50 percent to 30 percent) and 2. idiopathic heart block clamed as cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) (proposed rating reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In the August 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to reduce the Veteran's disability benefits related to his acquired psychiatric disorder and enlarged heart disability.  Such is not an appealable decision, as it does not constitute a decision under 38 U.S.C. § 511.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for restorations following the proposed reductions in the evaluations for the acquired psychiatric disorder and the enlarged heart are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from November 1986 to February 1999.

The Board finds that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder and enlarged heart ratings, which were proposed to be reduced, were not in fact reduced. 

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a claim for higher ratings for the acquired psychiatric disorder and enlarged heart.  In an August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ proposed reduction of the ratings for those disabilities.  In October 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) with August 2024 rating decision proposing reductions.

In a February 2025 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 50 percent disability rating for the acquired psychiatric disorder.  In a March 2025 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 30 percent rating for the enlarged heart.  The AOJ thus specifically did not follow through with the proposed reductions in this case.  

As such, there is no initial decision with regards to the reduction of evaluations for the acquired psychiatric disorder or enlarged heart.  The identified rating decision is thus not an appealable decision under 38 U.S.C. § 511, as a proposed reduction does not decide any questions of law or fact.  Accordingly, the appeal for the proposed reduction issues is dismissed as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
