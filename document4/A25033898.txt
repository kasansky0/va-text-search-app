ORDER

Prior to July 12, 2022, entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent prior to July 12, 2022, and in excess of 50 percent thereafter for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.  

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to July 12, 2022, the Veteran's sleep apnea, at a minimum, manifested with persistent daytime hypersomnolence. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Prior to July 12, 2022, the criteria for entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6847.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2001 to October 2006.    

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent prior to July 12, 2022, and in excess of 50 percent thereafter for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that on September 28, 2022, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), citing an April 1, 2022, rating decision.  However, PTSD is not on appeal because the April 1, 2022, rating decision was a proposed reduction of PTSD, which is not an appealable issue.  

The Board also notes that the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) on September 15, 2022 seeking service connection for persistent daytime hypersomnolence.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased 50 percent rating for service-connected OSA, effective July 12, 2022, based on a worsening of the Veteran's OSA to include use of a CPAP and an additional symptom of persistent daytime hypersomnolence.  Therefore, the issue on appeal is whether the Veteran is entitled to an initial rating greater than 0 percent for service-connected OSA from May 5, 2022 to July 12, 2022, and whether the Veteran is entitled to a rating in excess of 50 percent from July 12, 2022 to August 22, 2022 (the date of the notification letter to the August 2022 rating decision on appeal).   

Prior to July 12, 2022, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 0 percent for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an increased initial rating for his service-connected OSA.  See September 2022 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182). 

When a Veteran seeks an increased evaluation, it will generally be presumed that the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation is sought, and it follows that such a claim remains in controversy where less than the maximum benefit available is awarded.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where the question to consider is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged" rating are required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings," whether it is an initial rating case or not.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.   

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent competent medical and lay evidence.  Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  The Veteran is competent to observe symptoms as well as when the symptoms occurred.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In the August 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted the Veteran service connection for OSA and assigned a 0 percent rating effective May 5, 2022.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased 50 percent rating for service-connected OSA, effective July 12, 2022.  

The Veteran's OSA is evaluated under DC 6847. Pursuant to DC 6847, a 0 percent rating is warranted for asymptomatic but with documented sleep disorder breathing. A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistent daytime hypersomnolence. A 50 percent rating is warranted for the required use of a breathing assistance device such as a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Finally, a 100 percent rating is warranted for chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or; the requirement of a tracheostomy.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2022, where the examiner confirmed a diagnosis of OSA following a sleep study conducted on July 14, 2022.  See July 2022 VA Examination.  The Veteran reported he had difficulty sleeping while deployed in Iraq.  He was told numerous times by his friends that he snored loudly and was disruptive.  He complained of chronic daytime fatigue.  After service, his wife also confirmed he is a loud snorer.  His current symptoms are daytime fatigue and snoring.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not require continuous medication for his OSA and did not require the use of a CPAP.  Regarding current findings, signs, or symptoms, the examiner did not check any of the offered boxes, including persistent daytime hypersomnolence.  However, the examiner found that the Veteran's OSA impacted his ability to work as he will miss 2-3 days of work per month to catch up on sleep.

In a September 2019 VA treatment record, the Veteran and his wife reported that the Veteran has difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.  See February 2022 VA Treatment Record dated September 2019.  The Veteran reported needing to nap during the day and he always feels exhausted.  Id.  

The Board finds that, prior to July 12, 2022, the Veteran's OSA, at a minimum, has been shown to manifest symptoms of hypersomnolence, the criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 6847.  The VA examiner did not check the box for persistent daytime hypersomnolence in the July 2022 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) but noted that the Veteran had chronic daytime fatigue and missed 2-3 days of work per month to catch up on sleep.  The Veteran's chronic daytime fatigue is confirmed by his September 2019 VA treatment record, where he reported needing to nap during the day and always feeling exhausted.  The Veteran's chronic daytime fatigue, exhaustion, and needing to nap during the day are symptoms associated with persistent daytime hypersomnolence. Moreover, this finding is consistent with the AOJ's favorable determination in the subsequent November 2022 rating decision that persistent daytime hypersomnolence was a symptom of the Veteran's OSA.

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as pain because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).     

The Board finds the Veteran's statements and the statements of his wife are generally consistent with the VA examination report, and there is no evidence to the contrary regarding the Veteran's reports of OSA hypersomnolence symptoms.  Accordingly, the Board finds these lay statements credible.  Thus, prior to July 12, 2022, the Veteran's OSA, at a minimum, has been shown to manifest symptoms of hypersomnolence.  

Therefore, prior to July 12, 2022, the Veteran is entitled to a minimum initial rating of 30 percent for service-connected OSA. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent prior to July 12, 2022 is discussed, below. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Yancy v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?484, 495 (2016); Doucette v. Shulkin, 38?Vet. App.?366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent prior to July 12, 2022, and in excess of 50 percent thereafter for service-connected obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.  

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802 (a).? Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that remand for pre-decisional duty to assist errors is required.

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent competent medical and lay evidence.  Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience.  Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  

As noted above, in the August 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted the Veteran service connection for OSA and assigned a 0 percent rating effective May 5, 2022.  In a November 2022 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran an increased 50 percent rating for service-connected OSA, effective July 12, 2022.  

For his claim, the Veteran was physically examined by a VA contract examiner in May 2022 which was before the Veteran has been afforded a sleep study.  The sleep study was conducted on July 14, 2022; the "Interpretation and Recommendations" section of the sleep study report included the following: "Consideration should be given to having the patient return to the lab for the purpose of CPAP titration."  The VA contract examiner listed the sleep study on the July 2022 VA examination report when he signed it on July 21, 2022, but did not otherwise appear to reevaluate the Veteran's OSA.  Despite evidence that use of a CPAP was recommended for the Veteran's newly diagnosed OSA, there is no evidence in the record prior to the August 2022 rating decision that the AOJ informed the Veteran of this recommendation or afforded him the opportunity to submit any post-sleep study treatment records prior to determining the initial rating.  Moreover, the AOJ improperly relied on the July 2022 VA examination which was inadequate due to the internally inconsistent findings concerning persistent daytime hypersomnolence.  As such, the AOJ should have requested a new VA examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's OSA.  The Board finds the AOJ erred and remand is warranted to correct these pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).  

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Provide the Veteran and his representative a copy of the July 2022 Sleep Test Report, to include the recommendations for treatment. 

2. Afford the Veteran the Veteran the opportunity to submit any treatment records related to his OSA.    

3. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the severity of his OSA from May 5, 2022.
