FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Actual employability has not been established by clear and convincing evidence from March 1, 2024.

2. With restoration of the Veteran's TDIU, basic eligibility to DEA benefits is restored from March 1, 2024.

3. The restoration of the Veteran's TDIU is granted herein for the entire period on appeal.

4. The restoration of the Veteran's basic eligibility to DEA benefits is granted herein for the entire period on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for restoration of a TDIU from March 1, 2024, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.343, 4.16.

2. The criteria for restoration of basic eligibility for DEA benefits from March 1, 2024, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.807.

3. The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of the May 2024 denial of TDIU because TDIU has been granted herein; the claim is rendered moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101.

4. The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of the May 2024 denial of basic eligibility to DEA benefits because eligibility has been granted herein; the claim is rendered moot.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 2007 to April 2008.

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) discontinued the Veteran's TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA effective March 1, 2024, in a March 2024 rating decision (RD).  

Subsequently, the Veteran submitted a new claim for TDIU in May 2024.  TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA were denied in a May 2024 RD.  

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD)) in May 2024, appealing the March 2024 and May 2024 RDs, and choosing the "Direct Review" lane.  As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decisions on appeal, that is, evidence submitted prior to March 1, 2024 and May 17, 2024.

The Board notes that the May 2024 VA Form 10182 listed three additional issues and did not list the issues of basic eligibility to DEA benefits and restoration thereof.  However, three of the listed issues are not currently before the Board and the Board finds it appropriate to take jurisdiction of the DEA benefits claims.  Specifically, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 is not timely as to the March 2014 grant of TDIU and denial of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  The Veteran was informed that her appeals of the March 2014 RD were not timely in a June 2024 letter.  Although the letter discussed a later May 2024 Higher Level Review request, the Board finds it is sufficient.  

Additionally, the May 2024 proposed reduction for migraines was not yet appealable at the time of the May 2024 VA Form 10182 as it was only a proposed, not final, action.  The Veteran was informed of the prematurity of her NOD in an October 2024 letter.  The proposed reduction was effectuated in an October 2024 RD.  If the Veteran wishes to appeal this RD, she should submit a timely Decision Review Request.  

Finally, the Board notes that the two above issues regarding DEA benefits are not listed on the May 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, these issues have been raised by the record and are inextricably intertwined with the other issues on appeal.  Specifically, the DEA benefits were discontinued and sought again as part of the TDIU claims.  Given these circumstances, the Board finds that the issues of restoration of basic eligibility to DEA benefits and entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA benefits must be addressed as part of the adjudication of the TDIU issues on appeal.  See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("VA is obligated to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence."); Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332 (2006) (noting that, once the Board has jurisdiction over a claim, it has the authority to address all issues related to that claim, including those not decided by the RO); Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 391-92 (1993) (holding that the Board's inquiry is not limited to specific questions decided by the Regional Office but includes all questions reasonably raised by the record that were necessary to its decision on that matter).

1. Restoration of TDIU

The Veteran contends that the discontinuance of her TDIU was improper as she did not maintain substantially gainful employment for 12 consecutive months in 2022 and she remains unemployable due to her service-connected disabilities.  See April 2024, Veteran statement.

A total disability rating may be granted where the schedular rating is less than 100 percent if the Veteran is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to service-connected disabilities.

When reducing an award of TDIU, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) apply, but caution must be exercised in such a determination that actual employability is established by clear and convincing evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(1).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), disability rating reductions must follow specific procedural guidelines.  First, there must be a rating action that proposes the reduction and gives the Veteran 60 days to submit additional evidence and request a predetermination hearing.  If a hearing is not requested, and reduction is still warranted, a rating action will be taken to effectuate the reduction.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i)(2).  The effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the Veteran of the final action expires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i)(2)(i).

If a Veteran with a TDIU rating begins to engage in substantially gainful employment, the Veteran's rating may not be reduced solely for securing and following such employment unless the Veteran maintains the employment for 12 consecutive months.  38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(2).  For TDIU reductions, temporary interruptions in employment of short duration shall not be considered breaks in otherwise continuous employment.  Id. 

The clear and convincing evidentiary standard requires that capacity for work be proven to a "reasonable certainty" but not necessarily be "undebatable."  Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999).  The clear and convincing standard of proof is an intermediate standard between preponderance of the evidence (now evidence persuasively favoring one side or the other) and beyond a reasonable doubt.  Fagan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 48, 55 (1999) (citing Olson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 430, 434 (1993)).

In September 2023, the AOJ sent to the Veteran a letter explaining that information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicated that the Veteran had received wages above the poverty threshold in 2022.  The September 2023 AOJ letter also proposed to discontinue her TDIU benefits and explained that entitlement to DEA benefits and/or any other benefits associated with her eligibility for a TDIU may also be discontinued.  The letter informed the Veteran of how to provide evidence to explain the wages or to request a hearing.  The Veteran did not request a hearing but did submit a statement indicating that she had been employed for less than 12 months and was still unable to work due to her service-connected disabilities.  See October 2023, Veteran statement.

The AOJ then discontinued the Veteran's TDIU and basic eligibility for DEA benefits, both effective March 1, 2024 (the day following the date of last payment).  The AOJ explained that, while the Veteran had submitted a statement regarding her employment status, she had not included a statement from her employer verifying such.  The AOJ also stated that if evidence showing continued unemployability was received within one year of the date of the decision notice, a TDIU may be restored from the date of the reduction.

Regarding the discontinuance of the Veteran's TDIU, Congress has provided that a Veteran's disability will not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  When an AOJ reduces a rating without following the applicable regulations, the reduction is void ab initio.  Greyzck v. West, 12 Vet. App. 288, 292 (1999).

At the outset, the Board points out that 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) sets forth procedural requirements for reductions in disability compensation ratings.  In the instant case, the Board finds that the procedural requirements and safeguards outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) governing rating reductions were explained to the Veteran in adequate detail in the September 2023 proposed reduction letter before the March 2024 final rating reduction.  Thus, all procedural requirements were met.

Although the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) were met, specific to reductions of a TDIU, VA regulation provides that a rating of 100 percent disability based on individual unemployability may be reduced, subject to the procedural protections of § 3.105(e), but caution must be exercised in such a determination that "actual employability is established by clear and convincing evidence."  38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(1).  A finding of "actual employability" must encompass a finding that the Veteran is no longer unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Further, "[i]f a Veteran with a TDIU begins to engage in a substantially gainful occupation after January 1, 1985, the veteran's rating may not be reduced solely based on such occupation unless the veteran maintains the occupation for a period of twelve consecutive months."  38 C.F.R. § 3.343(c)(2).

In the instant case, the RO discontinued the Veteran's TDIU based on information received from the SSA, which purportedly showed that the Veteran had earned wages above the poverty threshold for calendar year 2022.  Notably, however, this evidence is not of record before the Board.  Furthermore, there is no indication from the evidence of record that the Veteran had maintained any substantially gainful occupation for a period of twelve consecutive months.  The Veteran submitted personal statements, as well as a letter from her former employer, indicating that she was employed from January 2022 to August 2022.  See March 2024, Letter from B.C.  There is no indication anywhere in the claims file that she has worked other than for this eight month time period.

Overall, based on the available evidence of record, the Board finds that termination of the Veteran's TDIU was not proper.  Indeed, as the information received from the SSA is not included in the record before the Board, the Board cannot conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence of actual employability.  There is no medical or lay evidence showing any improvement in her service-connected disabilities that would allow her to maintain employment.  Further, to the extent that the Veteran did engage in any substantially gainful occupation in 2022, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that any such occupation was maintained for a period of twelve consecutive months, as required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 (c)(2).  Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's TDIU was improperly discontinued, and the benefit is restored, effective March 1, 2024. 38 U.S.C.§ 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

2. Restoration of basic eligibility to DEA benefits

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if the Veteran has a permanent and total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501(a), (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.  In this case, basic eligibility for DEA benefits was established as an ancillary benefit related to the Veteran's award of TDIU and discontinuation of that benefit was directly tied to the RO's discontinuation of the Veteran's TDIU.  Given that entitlement to TDIU has been restored, and as there is otherwise no indication that the Veteran no longer meets any of the other criteria for basic eligibility for DEA benefits, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to restoration of basic eligibility for DEA benefits, also effective March 1, 2024.

3.  - 4. May 2024 denial of TDIU and Basic Eligibility to DEA Benefits

Issues 3-4: Subsequent to the March 2024 discontinuance of TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA benefits, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for TDIU and DEA benefits.  See March 2024, VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran appealed these denials in May 2024.  

Given the above restorations of TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA benefits, there is no period of time that the Veteran has not been in receipt of TDIU and eligibility to DEA benefits from the time of the March 2024 claim to the present.  As such, these claims are moot, and the Board must dismiss them for lack of jurisdiction.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  Here, as a result of the Board's grants herein, there no longer remains a case or controversy with respect to these claims.  Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over these issues because they have been granted and rendered moot on appeal.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.7, 20.101, 20.200, 20.202.  Therefore, dismissal of the claims is warranted.
