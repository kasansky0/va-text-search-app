ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in equipoise that Veteran's sleep apnea is due to his service-connected lumbar spine condition and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1984 to July 1986.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. Under the Direct Review Lane, the Board reviews the claim based on the evidence of record available to the AOJ at the time of the decision. As such, the Board will only consider the evidence received as of the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted for the claim for entitlement for service connection for sleep apnea and readjudicated is claim on the merits. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea

The Veteran contends that his current sleep apnea is due to obesity as a secondary step due to his service-connected musculoskeletal conditions. See May 2024 Correspondence. After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's sleep apnea is caused by his service-connected lumbar spine disability and associated bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies due to obesity as an intermediate step.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

Service connection may also be granted for disability, which is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entire record.

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of current symptomatology based on personal knowledge. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if the layperson: (1) is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) is describing symptoms that support a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, at 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-rule does not apply.

The evidence establishes that the Veteran has a current disability of obstructive sleep apnea. See August 2023 VA examination. 

The Board notes that, while obesity cannot be service-connected on a direct basis, and obesity cannot qualify as an in-service event for service-connection purposes, obesity may serve as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). VAOGCPREC 1-2017. In such a case, the evidence would need to reflect (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities caused the Veteran to become obese, (2) the obesity was a substantial factor is causing another disability, and (3) the disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities. Id. 

The Board finds probative a January 2023 medical opinion provided by a private clinician, that opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea would not have occurred but for the obesity caused his service-connected lumbar spine disability, left lower extremity radiculopathy, and right lower extremity radiculopathy. The clinician stated that the Veteran was unable to be as active as he was before his musculoskeletal conditions and subsequently began to gain weight. The clinician noted the Veteran's reports that he weighed 170 lbs. upon separation and had a current weight of 200 lbs. The clinician opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's weight gain is due to and or related to his service-connected lumbar spine disability, left lower extremity radiculopathy, and right lower extremity radiculopathy and that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's sleep apnea is secondary to the weight gain from these conditions. The Board finds this opinion probative as it is based upon review of the Veteran's service and civilian medical records, the Veteran's lay statements, and medical literature review. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion obtains probative weight from "factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion").

While an August 2023 VA medical opinion opined that the Veteran's obesity is less likely than not due to his service-connected conditions, the examiner stated that musculoskeletal conditions such as thoracolumbar arthritis can lead to weight gain due to decreased activity level related to pain and limited range of motion. The examiner stated that the Veteran also has right knee arthritis, depression, diabetes and diabetic peripheral neuropathy and PTSD, which can also cause weight gain. The examiner, however, failed to discuss that the Veteran's right knee arthritis, PTSD and depression are service-connected conditions. While the examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetes and diabetic neuropathy are the predominant cause of his weight gain and obesity, the examiner did not discuss that the Veteran was already gaining weight prior to his diagnosis of diabetes. The Board notes that the Veteran gained 20 pounds between the Veteran's separation examination in September 1986 (170 lbs.) and an examination in July 1988 (190 lbs). The July 1988 examination did not report a diagnosis of diabetes or diabetic neuropathy. As the opinion failed to discuss pertinent evidence of record, the opinion is found to be less probative than the private opinion. See id. 

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is caused by the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine condition and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy due to obesity as an intermediate step. The Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to a nexus, and when the evidence is in equipoise the claimant prevails. See Lynch. Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted. Id.; 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.
