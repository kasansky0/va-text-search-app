DOCKET NO. 250131-510238
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses on December 6, 2024, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran traveled to and from a VA facility for a dental appointment on December 6, 2024, but his appointment was cancelled by the clinic prior to his arrival; his failure to complete the appointment on December 6, 2024, was solely due to VA action and failure to timely notify the Veteran of the cancellation. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses on December 6, 2024, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.4, 70.10(a)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1966 to October 1968.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Combat Infantryman Badge, Vietnam Service Medal, and Vietnam Campaign Medal.

In January 2025, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2), an appellant may modify a NOD to change the Board docket being requested.  The time limit for such modification is "within one year from the date that the [AOJ] mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the [NOD], whichever is later." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2). "[T]he Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  However, because in this matter a full grant of the issues on appeal is warranted, the appellant is not prejudiced by the Board issuing this decision without such a delay.

Generally, VA beneficiary travel is a payment for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help Veterans and other persons obtain care or services from the Veterans Health Administration. 38 U.S.C. § 111 ; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10.  A Veteran is eligible for beneficiary travel payments for travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for the following: 1) treatment for a service-connected disability, regardless of the disability rating; 2) treatment for any disability, provided that the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; 3) a scheduled compensation and pension examination; 4) if the Veteran receives pension under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; 5) if the Veteran's annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that the Veteran would receive under 38 U.S.C. § 1521; or, 6) if, the Veteran is unable to defray the expenses of that travel under certain circumstances. 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

The Veteran requested travel beneficiary payment for his travel to an appointment on December 6, 2024.  The Veteran advised he attended the appointment on December 6, 2024, but after he arrived, he was told the appointment was cancelled.  The Veteran advised he lives fifty minutes away and his appointment was at 7:30am and the call to notify him of the cancellation came in while he was traveling to the appointment.   The Veteran's claim was denied in December 2024 beneficiary travel denial letter on the basis that his appointment was cancelled by the clinic.  The Veteran contends that since he traveled to the appointment and was not informed of the cancellation until he was at the scheduled appointment, he should be reimbursed for his travel.

The determination letter issued a favorable finding the Veteran was administratively eligible for beneficiary travel reimbursement.  As such, the threshold requirement for receipt of beneficiary travel benefits has been met. 38 C.F.R. § 70.10.

The Veteran's VHA file confirms that his appointment scheduled for December 6, 2024, was cancelled by the clinic.  In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran reported that he presented to the appointment and was advised it was cancelled.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record is in approximate balance as to whether the December 6, 2024,VA scheduled appointment is entitled to payment or reimbursement for round-trip beneficiary travel expenses.  The December 6, 2024, VA dental clinic appointment was cancelled by VA with no legitimate notice to the Veteran.  The Veteran's failure to obtain care was due solely to VA actions.  Thus, in resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses on December 6, 2024, is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 70.4 (a)(5).
