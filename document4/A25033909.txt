ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In September 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in an attempt to appeal the July 2024 Board decision denying service connection for a left hip disability.  

2. The extent to which the September 2024 VA Form 10182 may be construed as a motion for reconsideration of the July 2024 Board decision is a separate consideration by the Chairman. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include ase secondary to a service-connected disability, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1979 to August 1982, from June 1983 to October 1983, and from February 1984 to November 1984. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on an attempted appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by the Board. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include a secondary to a service-connected disability

The Board is prohibited on direct appeal from considering a previously, finally decided claim on the same factual basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) and (b). The only means for obtaining such review are via a motion for reconsideration of the Board's decision on grounds of obvious error, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7103, or via a motion for revision of the Board's decision on grounds of clear and unmistakable error pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7111.

In July 2024, the Board issued a decision denying entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability.  In a September 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran listed the issue on appeal as service connection for a left hip disability, and listed the July 2024 Board decision as the decision he was appealing.   

The extent to which the September 2024 VA Form 10182 may be construed as a motion for reconsideration of the July 2024 Board decision is a separate consideration by the Chairman, and not addressed herein. It will be addressed in separate correspondence.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability, to include as secondary to a service-connected disability, is dismissed.
