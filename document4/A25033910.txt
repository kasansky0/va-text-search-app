REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from July1986 to December 2007. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal and it was not considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entirety of the record.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability as defined by VA regulations that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current right ear hearing loss disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  The record shows that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss does not meet the criteria to be considered a disability as defined by VA regulations.

The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels; higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).  However, to establish a current hearing loss disability for VA purposes, hearing examination results must meet the standards of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Hearing loss for the purpose of VA disability compensation is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In this case, a September 2023 VA audiology examination report showed puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	10	10	30	25

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear using the Maryland CNC word list.  

While the Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing, the determination of a current hearing loss disability is derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the audiometric testing at his September 2023 VA examination.

The Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is not warranted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, or other non-specific respiratory disability 

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, or other non-specific respiratory disability. In his August 2023 claim, he asserted that it was due to exposure to toxins from burn pits. In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made the binding favorable finding that the Veteran performed service in Southwest Asia.  Additionally, a December 2022 memorandum stated that the Veteran had military service that constituted a toxic exposure as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  

In August 2023, the Veteran completed a respiratory conditions (other than tuberculosis and sleep apnea) examination, which included an in-person examination of the Veteran and review of his pertinent medical history. Following examination, the examiner concluded that while the Veteran has seasonal allergies, he did not have a current diagnosis of a chronic respiratory disability.  No symptoms were documented at the VA examination.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had a chest x-ray in March 2020 that showed "no infiltrate or effusion."  The Veteran underwent a pre-bronchodilator  pulmonary function test in August 2023.  His forced vital capacity (FVC) was 89% predicted.  His forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV-1) was 93% predicted.  His FEV-1/FVC was 104%.  These are all normal results.  Merck Manual 20th ed p. 395. The examiner stated that post-bronchodilator testing and diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide by the single breath method (DLCO) were not indicated.

The Veteran did not submit a lay description of any respiratory symptoms.  

The record does not establish a diagnosis of sinusitis or other respiratory disability aside from sleep apnea. The Veteran's sleep apnea is already service-connected. In the absence a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for sinusitis, or other non-specific respiratory disability is not warranted.    

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Ratings are assigned based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In deciding this appeal, the Board has considered whether separate ratings for different periods of time, based on the facts found, are warranted, a practice of assigning ratings referred to as "staging the ratings." See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for status-post left ankle fracture with Achilles calcaneal enthesitis

The Veteran's left ankle disability is evaluated under Diagnostic Code 5271. Under Diagnostic Code 5271, relating to limitation of motion of the ankle, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limitation of motion, which is less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limitation of motion, which is less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion. Normal range of motion for the ankles is 0 to 20 degrees of dorsiflexion and 0 to 45 degrees of plantar flexion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.71, Plate II.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).

The Veteran's ankle disabilities were most recently evaluated in an August 2023 VA ankles examination, which included and in-person examination of the Veteran and review of his pertinent medical history. Both ankles were tested. At the examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with right Achilles calcaneal enthesitis and status-post left ankle fracture with left Achilles calcaneal enthesitis.  His bilateral ankle disabilities manifested in limited motion and chronic pain. The Veteran reported flare-ups of his left ankle disability only. The Veteran reported being unable to run, walk more than a quarter mile, and unable to carry more than 23 pounds.  He took prescription medication for his ankles.  The Board is granting the maximum schedular rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability under Diagnostic Code 5271.  Therefore a remand for an examiner to estimate what his left ankle disability picture would look like without medication would not help the Veteran.  

The Veteran's left ankle had dorsiflexion to 10 degrees, plantar flexion to 20 degrees with noted pain on movement during dorsiflexion. There was objective evidence of pain on weight bearing, passive range of motion, active motion in the left ankle when testing. There was evidence of crepitus and no evidence of pain on weight bearing. The Veteran performed repetitive-use testing with no additional function or range of motion loss. The examiner estimated left ankle range of motion of dorsiflexion to 5 degrees and plantar flexion to 15 degrees. During flare-ups, the examiner estimated left ankle range of motion of dorsiflexion to 5 degrees and plantar flexion to 15 degrees. He did not have muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or any other pertinent physical findings related to his left ankle disability. The examiner found that there was no suspected ankle dislocation or instability. The Veteran did not require an assistive device for ambulation or stability. The examiner noted that the Veteran's left ankle disability manifested in functional loss of not being able to walk more than a quarter mile or carry more than 25 pounds.

During a flare up and after repetitive use testing, the Veteran's left ankle dorsiflexion is 5 degrees.  The 20 percent rating criteria are met when dorsiflexion is "less than" 5 degrees.  The Board finds that in this case, the 20 percent rating should be applied because a dorsiflexion of 5 degrees is more closely described by "less than" 5 degrees instead of "less than 15 degrees" in the 10 percent criteria.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  For these reasons, a 20 percent rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability is granted.  

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus 

The Veteran claims entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus. The Veteran was granted service connection for tinnitus, effective July 14, 2023, in an October 2023 rating decision. 

Tinnitus is evaluated under Diagnostic Code 6260, which provides for a maximum 10 percent rating for recurrent tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87 (2017). A single evaluation is assigned for recurrent tinnitus whether the sound is perceived in one or both ears. See Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (2006). As there is no legal basis upon which to award a separate schedular evaluation for tinnitus, the Veteran's claim for such a benefit is without legal merit. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

In reaching the conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claims, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).

3. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for scar, left ankle

The Veteran's left ankle scar was rated under Diagnostic Code 7802. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802, was for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that were superficial and nonlinear. Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7802 instructed that a superficial scar was one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Id.

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Diagnostic Code 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018, amendments.

The Veteran's left ankle scar was most recently evaluated in a September 2023 scars/disfigurement DBQ. At examination, the Veteran was noted to have a left ankle scar measuring 1.5 centimeters long and .2 centimeters wide. The scar was not unstable or painful.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's left ankle scar is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. However, the Veteran's left ankle scar is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and non-linear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Moreover, the Veteran's left ankle scar is not unstable or painful. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, and 7804, both prior to and from August 13, 2018, are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under both pre- and post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, and these reports are credible. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the Veteran's left knee scar is manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for a left ankle scar. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

With respect to all of the issues being remanded below, the Board apologizes for the delay.  

1. Entitlement to a disability rating of 20 percent for Achilles calcaneal enthesitis, right ankle, is remanded.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his right ankle in August 2023.  He stated that he had a prescription that he used for relief of symptoms.  The U. S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently held that if a Diagnostic Code for a musculoskeletal disability does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of the disability.  Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327. 

The August 2023 examiner did not estimate what his disability picture would look like without the impact of medication.  The Board cannot provide this estimate on its own because it is a medical determination.  Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171 (1991).  Unfortunately, the only available option to allow compliance with Ingram is to remand for a supplemental opinion.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion, left knee, is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion, right knee, is remanded. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his knee disabilities in August 2023.  He stated that his treatment included use of medication.  As noted above, the Court has held that the Board must discount the impact of medication when evaluating a musculoskeletal disability when the Diagnostic Code does not reference medication.  Id..  The August 2023 examiner did not estimate what his disability picture would look like without the impact of medication.  The Board cannot provide this estimate on its own because it is a medical determination.  Colvin, 1 Vet. App. 171.  Unfortunately, the only available option to allow compliance with Ingram is to remand for a supplemental opinion.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

4. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for a thoracolumbar spine disability, to include degenerative disc disease and strain of the thoracolumbar spine, is remanded.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his back disability in August 2023.  He stated that his treatment included use of meloxicam and Tylenol.  As noted above, the Court has held that the Board must discount the impact of medication when evaluating a musculoskeletal disability when the Diagnostic Code does not reference medication.  Id..  The August 2023 examiner did not estimate what his disability picture would look like without the impact of medication.  The Board cannot provide this estimate on its own because it is a medical determination.  Colvin, 1 Vet. App. 171.  Unfortunately, the only available option to allow compliance with Ingram is to remand for a supplemental opinion.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  

These matters are remanded for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran's claims file to a clinician to provide a supplemental opinion for the Veteran's right ankle disability.  The claims file must be reviewed by the clinician.  A physical examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the clinician.  

The clinician must provide an estimated description of the Veteran's right ankle disability picture, including ranges of motion, without the benefit of medication.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.

2. Provide the Veteran's claims file to a clinician to provide a supplemental opinion for the Veteran's right and left knee disabilities.  The claims file must be reviewed by the clinician.  A physical examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the clinician.  

The clinician must provide the following: 

a.	an estimated description of the Veteran's right knee disability picture, including ranges of motion, without the benefit of medication.  

b.	an estimated description of the Veteran's left knee disability picture, including ranges of motion, without the benefit of medication.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training. 

3. Provide the Veteran's claims file to a clinician to provide a supplemental opinion for the Veteran's back disability.  The claims file must be reviewed by the clinician.  A physical examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the clinician.  

The clinician must provide an estimated description of the Veteran's back disability picture, including ranges of motion, without the benefit of medication.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
