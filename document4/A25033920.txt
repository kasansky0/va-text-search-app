ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive evidence of record indicates the Veteran's current right knee disability is etiologically related to active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 6, 2004 to November 11, 2005 and from October 7, 2010 to November 26, 2011.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred coincident with or aggravated by service.?38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303?(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Holton v. Shinseki,?557 F.3d 1362, 1366?(Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi,?381 F. 3d 1163, 1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection. Coburn v. Nicholson,?19?Vet. App.?247, 431?(2006). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.?38?C.F.R. §?3.303?(d). 

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including other organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.?38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137;?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309. 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support the claim.?38?C.F.R. §§?3.303?(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki,?708 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of right knee osteoarthritis. Thus, the first element of service connection is satisfied. The Veteran avers that in-service injury to his right knee, a consequence of repeated forceful landings and daily running, have resulted in current disability, or that in the alternative, gait abnormalities secondary to service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis and pes planus, have caused or aggravated his current knee disability.

In support of his assertions, the Veteran has submitted a May 2022 private medical opinion, furnished by M.L., MD, a treating provider, asserting that the Veteran repeated jumped off trucks from up to six feet off the ground and ran long distances daily, resulting in onset of knee pain in service. Additionally, the private provider states that gait abnormalities of the kind attributable to the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot disability can cause knee disability. 

The Board affords the May 2022 private opinion considerable probative value, as it is predicated on familiarity with the record in this case, affords due consideration to the Veteran's credible lay statements, and is reasoned and otherwise in general accord with the objective medical evidence in the record.

The Board acknowledges the negative etiological opinions furnished by VA examiners in this case, but finds them to be of less probative value for various reasons. First, a VA examiner with whom the Veteran met in September 2021 opined that, "[t]here is no evidence based on review of medical records to show [causation or aggravation] of the veteran's right knee osteoarthritis as a result of plantar fasciitis and flat feet. Records are silent for a severe pronation of the feet leading to increased stress on the knees. There are no records to show a chronic abnormal gait placing increased stress on the knees as a result of his feet. Aggravation cannot be established." The Board notes that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, as the opinion infers, and that moreover the examiner does not appear to have afforded due (or any) consideration to the Veteran's credible lay statements of record.

An April 2023 VA examiner opined that, "there is no STR found for the right knee condition during service that might be conceded during combat service. However, the veteran could have indicated/reported his right knee pain during his SHA on 08/22/2019 (P:218) which is silent for the knee concern. PEB Referral Transmisal (sic) document on 07/24/2011 (3266) shows that the veteran had plantar fasciitis and lumbar strain but silent for the knee condition. Therefore, it is less likely than not: THE VETERAN'S CLAIMED RIGHT KNEE DEGENERATIVE CHANGES, IS LESS LIKELY THAN NOT INCURRED IN OR CAUSED BY THE VETERAN RECEIVED COMBAT ACTION BADGE THEREFORE, RIGHT KNEE INJURY IS CONCEDED DURING SERVICE." Setting aside the general incoherence of the opinion, the assertion that the August 2019 examination was silent for knee symptoms is inaccurate. Indeed, the August 2019 General Medical Examination noted a history of bilateral knee pain.

Accordingly, finding the most persuasive evidence of record in favor of the claim, the Board finds warranted entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability, and the appeal will be granted.
