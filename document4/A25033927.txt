REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In February 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a January 2021 Explanation of Payment (EOP) issued by VA. 

Upon secondary review in July 2021, the claim for payment for this episode of care was then administratively approved while this appeal was pending. 

A July 2021 letter to the appellant stated that the episode of care was approved, and payment would be processed according to VA policy. The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the entire October 1, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial, and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
