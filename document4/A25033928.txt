ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 13, 2017, for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease was denied in a January 2018 rating decision on the basis of no current diagnosis. 

2. November 2017 medical records showing a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, obtained in February 2018, were not part of the actual record before agency adjudicators at the time of the January 2018 rating decision and related to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 13, 2017, for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease have been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1569(b), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In September 2023 , the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023 decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 decision [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window].  In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of September 13, 2017, for service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease is granted. 

In April 2023 the AOJ granted service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and assigned an effective date of January 18, 2023. The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date. He specifically contends that he is entitled to an effective date of September 13, 2017, citing to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). 

As discussed further below, the Board concludes that while § 3.156(c) is inapplicable in the instant case, the Veteran is nonetheless entitled to an effective date of September 13, 2017, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). 

In January 2018 the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of service connection for GERD based on a finding that the Veteran had no diagnosis of GERD. In the absence of proof of a present disability due to disease or injury, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Later, in April 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for GERD as proximately due to the Veteran' service connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with traumatic brain injury (TBI). 

The Veteran, through counsel, argues that service treatment records (STRs) newly associated with the claims file after the January 2018 rating decision which relate to his PTSD and TBI entitle the Veteran an effective date prior to January 18, 2023, for service connection for GERD. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) if VA receives or associated with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. An award made based all or in part on such records will be effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later. 

The Veteran, through counsel, argues that the newly received STRs include a physical profile for PTSD and TBI. However, the Board finds that such records did not inform any part of the analysis of the April 2023 VA examiner who opined that the Veteran's GERD was proximately due to his service connected PTSD with TBI. Neither were these records discussed in the AOJ's analysis in the April 2023 grant of benefits. The Board cannot find that the April 2023 grant of service connection for GERD was based, all or in part, on any newly received service treatment records. Thus, the Board concludes that entitlement to an effective date prior to January 18, 2023, under § 3.156(c) is not established. 

However, § 3.156(b) provides that when new and material evidence is received prior to the expiration of the appeal period following a rating decision, then such evidence will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. The appeal period for decisions issued under the Legacy adjudication decision is one year from the date of notification of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. New and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). The requirement of new and material evidence raising a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim is a low threshold, to be viewed as "enabling rather than precluding reopening." Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110, 121 (2010). In adjudicating a claim for benefits, VA must consider all pertinent lay and medical evidence of record. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a), § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for GERD in September 2017. As discussed above, the AOJ denied this claim based on the finding that the Veteran had no current diagnosis of GERD. The Veteran was notified of this decision by correspondence dated January 8, 2018. Less than one year later, in February 2018, VA received VA treatment records that included a November 2017 VA treatment note showing a diagnosis of GERD. 02/09/2018, CAPRI. 

The Board finds that this evidence is new, in that it was not part of the actual record before agency adjudicators at the time of the January 2018 rating decision. The evidence is material in that it related to the unestablished fact of whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of GERD at the time of his September 2017 claim. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the November 2017 VA treatment note, received February 2018, was new and material evidence. Thus, the Veteran's September 2017 claim remained pending until the April 2023 decision that granted service connection for GERD.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400

Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran has had a diagnosis of GERD since at least July 2010. 03/12/2019, CAPRI at 629. As noted above, an April 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD is proximately due to his service connected PTSD with TBI. The Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD as proximately due to PTSD with TBI were met as of the date of the September 2017 claim. Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 13, 2017, for gastroesophageal reflux disease as proximately due to service connected posttraumatic stress disorder with traumatic brain injury are met, and the same is hereby granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
