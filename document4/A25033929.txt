ORDER

The appeal for service connection for migraines is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACTS

1. On August 20, 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the February 2024 rating decision denying service connection for migraines. This supplemental claim was adjudicated in an October 2024 rating decision. 

2. On August 22, 2024, the Veteran filed a Board appeal of the February 2024 rating decision denying service connection for migraines.

3. As the August 2024 supplemental claim was filed prior to the August 2024 Board appeal and was still pending at the time the Board appeal was filed, the August 2024 Board appeal was an impermissible concurrent election and therefore invalid.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for migraines have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2008 to July 2012, in the United States Army.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) upon an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal seeking review of a February 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). Upon review of the record, the Board finds that this VA Form 10182 was not valid and that the Veteran's appeal must accordingly be dismissed.

Regarding the relevant procedural history, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for migraines that was denied by the RO in a February 2024 rating decision.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) became effective in February 2019 and created a new framework for VA claimants to seek review of VA decisions. Under the AMA, after the RO renders a decision on a claim, a claimant may take any of the following actions: (1) file a request for higher-level review within one year of the date of notice of the decision, (2) file a Board appeal within one year of the date of notice of the decision, or (3) file a supplemental claim at any time. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

Concurrent elections are specifically prohibited under the AMA framework. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). A claimant who has filed for review under one of the three options may not file for review under a different available option until the higher-level review, supplemental claim, or Board appeal is adjudicated or the request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or Board appeal is withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

Here, on August 20, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. The Veteran's August 2024 supplemental claim requested readjudication of the February 2024 rating decision denying service connection for migraines. 

On August 22, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal appealing the February 2024 rating decision denying service connection for migraines.

There is no indication that the Veteran's August 2024 supplemental claim for service connection for migraines was withdrawn-rather, the record shows that it was adjudicated by the RO in October 2024. Therefore, the Veteran's August 20, 2024 supplemental claim for service connection for migraines was pending at the time that the Veteran filed his August 22, 2024 Board appeal for service connection for migraines. Accordingly, the August 2024 Board appeal for service connection for migraines was a concurrent election.

In sum, as the August 2024 supplemental claim was filed prior to the August 2024 Board appeal and was still pending at the time the Board appeal was filed, the August 2024 Board appeal was an impermissible concurrent election and therefore invalid. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The Board notes that this appeal is not being dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but rather for failure to comply with a mandatory claims processing rule. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024). Accordingly, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) are not applicable. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) (requiring notice and the opportunity to respond when the Board, on its own initiative, raises a question as to a potential jurisdictional defect).

As Congress has prohibited concurrent elections, this appeal must be dismissed. If the Veteran would like the Board to review his claim for service connection for migraines, he may appeal the October 2024 denial of his supplemental claim.
