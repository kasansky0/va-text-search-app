DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder with anxiety (PTSD) is dismissed.

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection duodenal ulcer claimed as a stomach condition, is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An October 2016 rating decision denied the claims for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and duodenal ulcer, claimed as a stomach condition. Nothing was submitted to VA in the one year period following the decision.

2. In the one year prior to receipt of the May 2022 VA Form 10182, no eligible rating decision in the modernized review system (AMA) adjudicated claims for service connection for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and duodenal ulcer, claimed as a stomach.

3. The Board finds no basis to waive the mandatory claims processing rules in this appeal.

4. The issue of service connection for carotid artery, left side, had not been adjudicated at the time the VA Form 10182 was received, and accordingly was not docketed as an appealed issue.

5. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's skin cancer is related to herbicide agent exposure. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (c)(2), 19.2(d), 19.52(b), 20.104(c), 20.203(c). 

2. The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (c)(2), 19.2(d), 19.52(b), 20.104(c), 20.203(c). 

3. The issue of entitlement to service connection for stomach ulcer is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (c)(2), 19.2(d), 19.52(b), 20.104(c), 20.203(c). 

4. The issue of entitlement to service connection for skin cancer are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1168; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1968 to February 1972. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

On May 21, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the direct review docket. He identified the appealed claims as entitlement to service connection for PTSD, decision date April 2022, service connection for skin cancer, bilateral hearing loss, carotid artery, and stomach ulcer, noting decision date "on file."

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), to confirm his selection of Board review and elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 17, 2024.

As explained at length in the decision, the only issue properly on appeal today is service connection for skin cancer, which was adjudicated in a February 2022 rating decision. The Board has applied the benefit of the doubt to assume this was the decision the Veteran referred to as being "on file."

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c) (2019). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2) (2012).

1. The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD is dismissed. 

2. The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

3. The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for duodenal ulcer, claimed as a stomach condition, is dismissed.

Under the AMA, a claimant may request review of a decision within one year from the date on which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issues a notice of a decision on a claim or issue as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (c) and may elect either Higher-Level Review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 or an appeal to the Board under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. At any time after Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) issues notice of a decision on an issue within a claim, a claimant may file a supplemental claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a). 

An appeal of a decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction consists of a notice of disagreement submitted to the Board in accordance with the provisions of §§ 20.202-20.204. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. A notice of disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary of VA; specifically, the VA Form 10182. If the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision addressed several issues, the notice of disagreement must identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. The term "issue" means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (c). The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. 

After review of the evidence, the Board finds that there was a procedural defect in the filing of the Veteran's appeal for these three issues, and that it was therefore improperly docketed. For the reasons laid out below, the Board must dismiss these three appeals.

By way of background, an October 2016 rating decision denied claims for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, duodenal ulcer and bilateral hearing loss. The Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement with the adverse decision, or any additional evidence within the one year following the notification letter of the decision. Thus, the decision became final. 

On August 27, 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 526EZ for service connection for, PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, stomach ulcer, skin cancer, tinnitus, pancreatitis, and left knee. He was notified by letter on August 31, 2021, that the proper form was needed for hearing loss, PTSD, and ulcer claims because they had been previously denied.

A February 2022 rating decision denied the claim of entitlement to service connection for skin cancer and left knee.

On February 25, 2022, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 526EZ for service connection for PTSD, skin cancer, bilateral hearing loss, pancreatitis/gall bladder, sleep apnea, right and left knees, and skin problems.

On March 9, 2022, the AOJ again notified the Veteran that several of these claims for service connection for were previously denied, including PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and left knee. As such, VA regulations require the Veteran to file a request on a proper form.

An April 2022 rating decision adjudicated the new claims of entitlement to service connection for skin problems, pancreatitis, gall bladder, and right knee. Regarding skin problems, it explained, "You claimed 'skin problems' on a separate claim for benefits from your claim for 'skin cancer.'" Thus, the decision addressed skin problems as a claim for any separate skin diagnosis other than squamous cell cancer. The rating decision also explained to the Veteran that his claims of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, PTSD, skin cancer, stomach ulcer, tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss, and sleep apnea could not be adjudicated as these claims were previously denied and a supplemental claim was required. The decision referenced the March 9, 2022 letter as notice of this.

On May 21, 2022, the Veteran submitted both a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application and a VA Form 10182.

The Supplemental Claim Application listed the following: PTSD with an identified decision notice date of "4/21/2022," and skin cancer, bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, sleep apnea, left knee, and carotid artery with an identified decision notice date of "on file." However, none of these issues were adjudicated in the April 2022 rating decision.

The VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement listed the following: PTSD with an identified decision notice date of "on file 4/21/2022," and skin cancer, hearing loss, carotid artery left side, and stomach ulcer with an identified decision notice date of "on file." Again, none of these issues were adjudicated in the April 2022 rating decision. 

On May 24, 2022, BVA issued a letter to the Veteran informing him that the Board needed more information to act on the 10182.

Specifically, on MAY 21, 2022, you submitted a Board Appeal (VA Form 10182), as well as a request for review in the Higher-Level Review and/or Supplemental Claim lane. Because you can only seek review of PTSD, SKIN CANCER, HEARING LOSS, ARTERY LEFT SIDE, AND STOMAC ULCER in one review lane at a time, in order to act on your request, we need you to tell us whether you would like to proceed in the Board Appeal review lane for these issues.

Instruction was given on how to submit a new 10182 within 60 days to proceed with the Board review option.

In response, on June 10, 2022, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 10182, selecting the Hearing docket at the Board and listing the issues of PTSD, skin cancer, hearing loss, artery left side, and stomach ulcer, all with 4/21/22 as the date of decision being appealed.

However, the fact remains that claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, carotid artery left side, and stomach ulcer were not adjudicated within one year prior to the May 2022 or June 2022 VA Forms 10182. The prior adjudication of PTSD, hearing loss, and ulcer was in October 2016, many years prior to the VA Forms 10182. The issue of carotid artery left side had never been adjudicated at the time of the notices of disagreement.

The skin cancer, however, was adjudicated in a February 2022 rating decision, within one year of the May 2022 and June 2022 VA Forms 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  As such, construing the Veteran's 10182 most favorably to the Veteran, the appeal is timely for the issue of skin cancer, and in December 2024 the undersigned VLJ held a hearing on entitlement to service connection for skin cancer. This issue is properly before the Board and is addressed in the next section of this decision.

In the absence of any appealable determination within one year prior to the receipt of the May 2022 VA Form 10182, the Board finds that the attempted appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and stomach ulcer is not valid. The issues of PTSD, bilateral hearing loss, and stomach ulcers were improperly included in this docket before the Board under the Appeals Modernization Act. The Board finds no basis on which to waive the mandatory claims-processing rule of appealing within one year of an adverse determination here, as the prior determination occurred more than 7 years prior to the notice of disagreement. Accordingly, the appeals must be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).

Service connection for carotid artery left side was not docketed as a validly appealed issue, likely because it was never adjudicated at all. Therefore, there is not a docketed appeal of this issue requiring dismissal.

The Veteran was advised at his hearing that if he wished to pursue the claims for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, bilateral hearing loss and stomach ulcer, he may submit a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) to initiate a new claim for these issues. Happily, in January 2025, the Veteran filed Supplemental Claims for several of these issues and they are currently being processed by the AOJ. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for skin cancer is denied.

The Veteran contends that his squamous cell carcinoma (skin cancer) is caused by herbicide exposure. This is the only service connection theory raised by the Veteran or the record.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The February 2022 rating decision made favorable findings that the Veteran is diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and that he was exposed to Agent Orange during military service in Vietnam and has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirement for presumptive service connection.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings, and they establish the first and second elements of service connection (current disability and in-service injury).

The only remaining requirement for service connection is a nexus between herbicide agent in service and the current skin cancer disability.

While the Veteran's skin cancer is not listed as a specified condition under the presumption of service connection due to herbicide agent exposure, that does not preclude proof of direct service connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). Once the presumption of exposure applies, the Veteran may establish direct service connection that his current disease processes are related to his exposure to agent orange. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994), rev'd in part, Combee v. Principi, 4 Vet. App. 78 (1993). 

However, the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence linking his skin cancer to herbicide agent exposure. In his lay evidence, it is clear that he sincerely believes his skin cancer is related to herbicide agent exposure. The Veteran has not claimed, and the record does not show, that he has the medical knowledge, expertise, or experience to provide a competent medical opinion on the question of whether his current skin cancer is caused by herbicide agent exposure. Such an opinion requires expertise and knowledge of pathology. Therefore, his lay evidence is not competent evidence of nexus, no matter how sincere. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).

In a release form for private dermatology records filled out by the Veteran in January 2022, he identified the records that may be released as "entire record" and "Other as listed: medical evidence of dioxin exposure causing skin cancer." Unfortunately, the medical records provided by the private dermatologist office contain no mention of anything relating to dioxin, agent orange, or herbicide agent.

Therefore, there is no competent medical or lay evidence demonstrating that the Veteran's herbicide agent exposure caused his skin cancer, to include squamous cell carcinoma. Nexus is not established, and service connection must be denied.

The Board has considered the fact that VA did not provide a medical examination for this claim prior to the February 2022 decision on appeal. The duty to assist requires an examination where there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or symptoms of disability may be associated with the established in-service event, injury, or disease or with another service-connected disability; but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on which to decide the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2006).

Here, at the time of the rating decision on appeal, there was competent evidence of a current disability and evidence establishing herbicide agent exposure in service. However, there was not an indication that the disability may be associated with the herbicide agent exposure. While the Veteran attributed his skin cancer to herbicide agent exposure, a conclusory generalized lay statement that a service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require an examination under McLendon. Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (rejecting appellant's argument that his "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems was enough to entitle him to a medical examination under the standard of [38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2)(B).]"). Therefore, there was no pre-decisional duty-to-assist error in the AOJ's decision not to provide an examination.

Moreover, the Secretary has determined, based on cumulative scientific data reported by the National Academies of Science since 1993, that melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, have no positive association with herbicide exposure. See VBA Letter 20-24-06, Exception to TERA Examination and Medical Opinion Requirement at pages 10-13 (June 12, 2024).

Effective August 10, 2022 (after the February 2022 rating decision on appeal) the PACT Act created a requirement for VA to provide a disability examination and secure a medical nexus opinion when a Veteran submits a compensation claim and has evidence of a disability and participation in a "toxic exposure risk activity," or TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a); see also Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). The Veteran participated in a TERA for purposes of this provision, based on his conceded exposure to herbicide agents. There is no suggestion of any other TERA in the record. However, there is an exception to the requirement of a TERA examination if the claimed disability has been determined to have no positive association with herbicide agent exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (b); see VBA Letter 20-24-06. The Secretary has determined, based on cumulative scientific data reported by the National Academies of Science since 1993, that melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, have no positive association with herbicide exposure. Id.  Therefore, there is no statutory duty to provide a TERA examination for the Veteran's squamous cell carcinoma under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (b).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether service connection for skin cancer is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding a nexus between skin cancer and herbicide agent exposure. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application when the evidence is persuasively for or against the claim). The claim is denied.
