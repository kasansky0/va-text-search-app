REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1990 to November 1994. 

The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a low back disorder in May 2019. Service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine was granted by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in a June 2019 rating decision and a 10 percent rating was assigned effective February 28, 2019.

In March 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine and a claim of service connection for lumbar radiculopathy. In July 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision granting service connection for radiculopathies of the right and left lower extremities and assigned bilateral 10 percent ratings, effective March 17, 2021. The AOJ also continued the 10 percent rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine.

In November 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim.  Specifically, he requested increased ratings and earlier effective dates for depressive disorder, erectile dysfunction, radiculopathies of the right and left lower extremities. He also claimed entitlement to an increased rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine, entitlement to TDIU, and an earlier effective date for the assignment of special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ.  

In a February 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the Veteran's ratings for his low back disorder, bilateral radiculopathies, depressive disorder, erectile dysfunction, and the rate of SMC. The AOJ also denied entitlement to earlier effective dates. 

In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's evaluations for degenerative arthritis of the spine and depressive disorder. The AOJ also granted entitlement to TDIU and DEA, effective November 9, 2021. 

In a May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the ratings for degenerative arthritis of the spine and depression. 

In February 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, requesting Higher Level Review (HLR) of the ratings and effective dates assigned for depression, degenerative arthritis of the spine, right and left lower extremity radiculopathies, erectile dysfunction, TDIU, DEA, and SMC assigned in the February 2022, April 2022, and May 2022 rating decisions. 

In May 2023, the AOJ issued an HLR decision granting an effective date of March 17, 2021 for TDIU and DEA and denying the remaining claims. 

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the May 2023 HLR decision. He selected the direct docket option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022, April 2022, and May 2022 AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In the May 2024 brief, the Veteran's representative strongly urged the Board to "issue a decision on the evidence of record" and stated on no uncertain terms that waiver of any duty to assist must be accepted. The representative followed this up with a waiver of a pre-decisional hearing at the Board and AOJ. The Board understands the Veteran wishes for a decision to be issued and accepts these statements as a waiver of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Earlier effective date claims

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An exception is that the day following the date of separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose controls if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, the general rule applies. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §3.400(b)(2)(i). Claim means a written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p). An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary. The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p)(1)(i). Initial claims include a new claim requesting service connection for a disability. Id.

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. As the claims in this case were filed prior to that date, the amendments are not applicable in this instance and the regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, will be applied in this case.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file (ITF) a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155). The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

There was an attempt to eliminate ITFs during AMA; however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated this elimination and IFTs are still in operation. See Military Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), (invalidating § 3.155 in part to the extent it excludes AMA supplemental claims from the intent to file framework).

Except as specifically provided, the effective date of a rating and award for pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For continuously pursued or supplemental claims, the effective dates are governed by 38?C.F.R. § 3.2500(h); see also 38?C.F.R. § 3.2501.  

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 12, 2020 for a grant of service connection for depressive disorder 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 12, 2020 for a grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction 

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to September 12, 2020 for a grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 for loss of use of a creative organ 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to September 12, 2020, for the award of service connection for depressive disorder, erectile dysfunction, and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 for loss of use of a creative organ. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have presented any evidence or argument to support this claim.

The record shows the VA acknowledged a September 12, 2020 Intent to File--the first was in February 2019. On September 30, 2020, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, claims of service connection for anxiety/depression and erectile dysfunction. This claim is not within one year of the February 2019 ITF.

In a November 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claims of service connection for unspecified depressive disorder, erectile dysfunction, and entitlement to SMC for loss of use, effective September 12, 2020, the date of the ITF.  

The Veteran's depression and erectile dysfunction were granted as secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine disorder. The Board recognizes that the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine specifically requires VA to evaluate "any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, separately, under an appropriate Diagnostic Code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Note (1). However, regarding neurological manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability, the evidence of record prior to his September 30, 2020 claim of service connection does not reflect that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was a neurologic abnormality associated with his spine as contemplated by Note (1). In fact, the June 2019 VA examination report showed no other neurologic abnormalities besides a report of radiculitis.

Moreover, although the Veteran's November 2018 treatment records show a past medical history of major depression, neither the records nor the Veteran related his depression to his service-connected lumbar spine disorder.

The Board finds that there is no document of record that can be construed as an informal or formal claim of service connection for any depression, anxiety, or erectile dysfunction prior to the September 12, 2020 ITF. Therefore, the evidence is against the assignment of an effective date prior to September 12, 2020 and the appeals must be denied.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 17, 2021 for a grant of service connection for radiculopathy, right lower extremity 

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 17, 2021 for a grant of service connection for radiculopathy, left lower extremity

On February 28, 2019, the Veteran submitted an ITF. The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine on May 3, 2019. 

At a June 2019 VA examination, the examiner noted treatment records from 2016 through 2018 showing back pain radiating to the hips, radiculitis, weakness in the legs, and radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported sciatic pain, including weakness and pain in the thighs.  The examiner report noted no evidence of a radiculopathy.

In a June 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim of service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine, effective February 28, 2019. The Veteran did not appeal the rating or effective date assigned. 

On March 17, 2021, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File. He filed a claim of service connection for lumbar radiculopathy on March 18, 2021. In the July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for radiculopathies of the right and left lower extremities, effective March 17, 2021. 

With resolution of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the claim date for radiculopathies of the right and left lower extremities is the same for the claim date for service connection for his low back disorder. The Veteran reported radicular symptoms associated with his low back disorder at the June 2019 VA examination and his treatment records from September 2018 show a diagnosis of a radiculopathy of the lumbar region. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date of February 28, 2019 is warranted for entitlement to service connection for right and left lower extremity radiculopathies.

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 17, 2021 for a grant of an increased 20 percent rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine

By way of history, as noted above, service connection for degenerative arthritis of the spine was granted in a June 2019 rating decision. The AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating, effective February 28, 2019. The Veteran did not appeal the rating or the effective date and the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.203, 20.1103 (2019). 

On March 17, 2021, the Veteran submitted an ITF. He filed a claim for an increased rating for his lumbar spine disorder on March 18, 2021. 

In the April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted an increased 20 percent rating, effective November 9, 2021. In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of March 17, 2021 for the 20 percent rating for the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the spine. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the evaluation and the effective date assigned in the May 2023 rating decision. 

The effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of claim, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1), (2). If the increase occurred after the date of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record to determine what is the earliest date that entitlement to an increase in disability compensation was factually ascertainable based on all the evidence. An April 2022 VA examination noted a worsening of the Veteran's forward flexion. Thus, the earliest date that entitlement arose for an increased rating for his low back disorder is March 17, 2021, the date of the Veteran's intent to file a claim. When an increased evaluation is granted based on medical evidence showing an increase in disability after the date the claim was received, the effective date of the increase is the date the claim was received.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have identified an earlier communication from the Veteran that may be construed as either a formal or informal claim for increase following the June 2019 final rating decision and prior to the March 17, 2021 effective date. The effective date is based upon law. Here, there was a prior final decision denying the benefit sought. The attempt to revisit that prior claim and decision is prohibited as that would vitiate the concept of finality. The proper effective date for an award based on a claim to reopen can be no earlier than the date on which that claim was received. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). Thus, despite the Veteran's argument that the effective date should be earlier, for the foregoing reasons, the date cannot be any earlier than the date he filed the claim on March 17, 2021. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 17, 2021 for a grant of entitlement to a total disability rating for individual unemployability (TDIU) 

It is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. The economic component requires a determination as to whether a Veteran's income exceeds the poverty threshold. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a Veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. With regard to the latter component, attention should be given to the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training. Consideration should also be given to both the Veteran's physical and mental abilities. From a physical standpoint, possible relevant factors include the Veteran's limitations as to lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as audio and visual limitations. Regarding the Veteran's mental ability, possible relevant factors include limitations as to memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration should not be given to the Veteran's age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

A total disability rating for compensation may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more. If there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and the combined rating must be 70 percent or more. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b), when a claimant is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities, but fails to meet the percentage requirements for eligibility for a total rating set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), such case shall be submitted for extraschedular consideration.

The ultimate question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination is for the adjudicator. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Floore v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 376, 381 (2013). As such, the focus of the examiner is not on whether the Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities, but the functional impairment caused solely by his service-connected disabilities.

Moreover, entitlement to a TDIU may be an element of an appeal for a higher initial rating. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Entitlement to a TDIU is raised where a veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and (3) submits evidence of unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 

As noted above, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his low back disorder in March 2021. In his November 2021 VA 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran stated that he was too disabled to work from December 23, 2020. 

In a February 2022 statement, the Veteran contended that he has been unable to work since December 2020 due to the symptoms of his back disorder and depressive disorder. Specifically, the Veteran stated that his back disorder caused constant back pain that radiated into his legs, groin, and hips that he could not stand for longer than 15 minutes and his employment required a lot of walking, which was very painful for him.  He further alleged that his depression caused irritability and agitation, and he often secluded himself to prevent altercations. His depression also made it difficult to focus and complete his work. 

In an April 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU and DEA, effective November 9, 2021, the date of claim. In a May 2023 HLR decision, the AOJ granted an effective date of March 17, 2021 for TDIU and DEA. This was the date the Veteran first met the schedular requirements for TDIU. 

The Board has presently granted an earlier effective date of February 28, 2019 for the grant of service connection for radiculopathies of the right and left lower extremities and the associated bilateral 10 percent ratings. Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for TDIU, effective September 12, 2020. 

The effective date of an award of increased disability compensation, to include TDIU, shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date, otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of claim, 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1), (2). If the increase occurred after the date of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.

The AOJ has already found that the Veteran was unable to secure gainful employment due to his service-connected disorders. The Veteran meets the schedular criteria effective September 12, 2020. The Veteran was too disabled to work as of December 23, 2020. The Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating in March 2021. Therefore, as the date that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran was unable to work was within one year of his increased rating claim, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and grants entitlement to TDIU, effective December 23, 2020, the date the Veteran was too disabled to work. 

8. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 17, 2021 for a grant of entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status 

Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits may be paid to dependents of a Veteran who has a service-connected disability that is rated permanent and total. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a), 21.3021. A total disability may be assigned where a Veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the Veteran is deemed unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341.

Here, the effective date of the Veteran's entitlement to eligibility to DEA is essentially tied to the effective date for the award of TDIU. As the Board has determined that the Veteran's symptoms warranted a TDIU effective December 23, 2020, eligibility to DEA is warranted as of that date as well.

Increased ratings claims

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; however, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

While it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition in order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

In deciding the Veteran's increased evaluation claims, the Board has considered the determinations in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999) and Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007), and whether the Veteran is entitled to an increased evaluation for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. 

9. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for unspecified depressive disorder

The Veteran's depressive disorder is evaluated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435, and is subject to the criteria of the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders that provide for the following:

A 50 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9435.

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is a Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact a Veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating. See Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Nevertheless, all ratings in the general rating formula are also associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the veteran's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms, a Veteran may only qualify for a given disability by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118.

The Board must consider the effects of each of the veteran's mental symptoms on his or her own social and occupational situation and undertake "a holistic analysis." Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 21-24 (2017).

In a September 2020 treatment record, the clinician noted no nervous tension or depression. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA mental disorders examination in October 2020. The examiner noted a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder.  The Veteran reported symptoms of irritability, depression, insomnia, anxiety, and disturbances of motivation and mood. He denied suicidal/homicidal ideation. A mental status examination was normal. Regarding social impairment, the Veteran has been married for 15 years to his wife and has two grown sons. Regarding occupational impairment, the Veteran reported working for probation and parole with a large case load but was off duty at that time due to his hip surgery. The examiner noted that testing showed no mental distress, which could be due to successful medication and therapy. The examiner opined that his depressive disorder manifested as occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication.

In a December 2021 statement, the Veteran stated that due to his depressive disorder, he experienced irritability, anger, and agitation. During work, he secluded himself to avoid altercations with others. He also reported difficulty concentration and social isolation. Additionally, he needed reminders from his wife to shave and shower. 

A March 2022 depression screen was negative. In an April 2022 psychiatry treatment record, the Veteran reported his depression and anxiety at a level "6-7" but he was achieving 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. 

At an April 2022 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of unspecified depressive disorder. The Veteran reported symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances.  Regarding social impairment, the Veteran has been married to his wife for 17 years. Regarding occupational impairment, the Veteran reported last working in December 2020, at which time he had a total hip replacement. The examiner opined that his depressive disorder manifested as occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation. 

In a May 2022 VA psychiatry note, the Veteran reported his level of depression and anxiety were a level 2 and he was sleeping 8 hours at night. An April 2023 depression screen was negative. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 50 percent for depressive disorder is not warranted. The Veteran's symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, sleep impairment, irritability, and difficulty with concentration. The record does not overall suggest the Veteran's depressive disorder was at a level of severity to preclude functioning independently, appropriately and effectively, as stated in the 70-percent rating criteria. The VA treatment records show no unusual or impaired thought content and no communication impairment. Although the Veteran reported agitation and irritability at work, there was no evidence of impaired impulse control to the point of violence. Although the Veteran reported some isolation, he was married and living with his wife. Moreover, although the Veteran was unemployed as of December 2020, the records attribute his leaving his job to his right hip replacement rather than his depressive symptoms; the depressive symptoms were not the reason he left. The Veteran's mental status examinations were normal, and he consistently denied suicidal or homicidal thoughts. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements regarding his symptoms. The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, and the Board finds him to be credible. However, the medical and lay evidence establish that, at worst, there has been occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas has not been shown. Although the Veteran reports some social and occupational impairment, such symptoms do not warrant a 70 percent evaluation or higher when all the other manifestations are considered. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to the claim for an increased rating for depression. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

10. Entitlement to an increased rating for degenerative arthritis of the spine in excess of 20 percent

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. As such, painful motion should be considered to determine whether a higher rating is warranted on such basis, whether or not arthritis is present. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that "[t]he joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint." Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is applicable to the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities involving actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints or periarticular regions, regardless of whether the Diagnostic Code under which the disability is evaluated is predicated on range of motion measurements. Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346 (2016).

When determining the severity of musculoskeletal disabilities, which are at least partly rated on the basis of range of motion, VA must consider the extent of additional functional impairment a veteran may have above and beyond the limitation of motion objectively demonstrated due to pain, limited or excess movement, weakness, incoordination, and premature or excess fatigability, etc., particularly when symptoms "flare up," to include periods of prolonged use, and assuming these factors are not already contemplated in the governing rating criteria. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021. 85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020). These amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities."

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110.

The Veteran's service-connected back disability is currently evaluated at 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5242-5237.

Under Diagnostic Code 5237, a 20 percent rating is warranted when there is forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 

A 40 percent evaluation is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 

A 50 percent evaluation is warranted when there is unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine; and a 100 percent evaluation is warranted when there is unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5237.

Note (1): Evaluate any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code.

Note (2): For VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees. The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. The normal combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. The normal ranges of motion for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined range of motion.

Note (3): In exceptional cases, an examiner may state that because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that individual, even though it does not conform to the normal range of motion stated in Note (2). Provided that the examiner supplies an explanation, the examiner's assessment that the range of motion is normal for that individual will be accepted.

Note (4): Round each range of motion measurement to the nearest five degrees.

Note (5): For VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

Note (6): Separately evaluate disability of the thoracolumbar and cervical spine segments, except when there is unfavorable ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single disability. Moreover, "chronic orthopedic and neurological manifestations" means orthopedic and neurologic signs and symptoms resulting from intervertebral disc syndrome that are present constantly, or nearly so. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-5243.

When rating diseases and injuries of the spine, any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Note (1).

Turning to the record, in a February 2021 treatment record, the clinician noted lumbar degenerative arthritis. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2021. The examiner noted diagnoses of degenerative arthritis, spinal stenosis, residual discectomy, right lower radiculopathy, and left lower radiculopathy. The Veteran reported symptoms of pain, weak legs, and pain in his ankles. Functional impairment included not being able to sit or stand for long periods. The Veteran reported severe flare ups, lasting days or even weeks. Active and passive range of motion testing showed flexion to 75 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, right lateral flexion to 20 degrees, left lateral flexion to 30 degrees, and rotation to 20 degrees, bilaterally. Pain was noted in all ranges.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional limitations. With consideration of flare ups, the Veteran's range of motion was additionally limited to 70 degrees of forward flexion, 15 degrees of extension, and 20 degrees of left lateral flexion and bilateral rotation. Muscle strength was normal with no atrophy. A sensory examination was normal, with the exception of decreased sensation to the left foot/toes. Straight leg raising test were negative. The Veteran did not have intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) or episodes of prescribed bed rest. The functional impact was restricted lifting, climbing, hiking, and running long distances. 

In July 2021, the Veteran underwent a L4-S1 fusion surgery. A March 2022 treatment record showed the Veteran reported daily, intermittent pain in his lower back that affects his sleep and physical activity. A separate March 2022 treatment record showed the Veteran reported a level of pain at a 0 and denied low back pain. A musculoskeletal examination showed full range of motion and no joint deformities. 

In an April 2022 VA examination report, the Veteran reported symptoms of back pain, radiculopathy, and big toe numbness. He stated that his pain was less since the last surgery. Functional limitations included limiting lifting of 20 pounds. The Veteran reported moderate flare ups lasting one to two days, precipitated by activity, such as working in garden beds. Active and passive range of motion testing showed flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, lateral flexion to 30 degrees bilaterally, and rotation to 30 degrees, bilaterally. Pain was noted on flexion and with weight bearing.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional limitations. With consideration of repeated use over time and flare ups, the Veteran's range of motion was additionally limited to 55 degrees of forward flexion. Muscle strength was normal with no atrophy and a reflex examination was normal. A sensory examination was normal, with the exception of decreased sensation to the left foot/toes. Straight leg raising tests were negative. The Veteran did not have intervertebral disc syndrome or episodes of prescribed bed rest. The examiner opined that his back disorder does not impact his ability to perform occupational tasks.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 20 percent for a low back disorder is not warranted. The evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine was limited to 30 degrees or less or that he had favorable or unfavorable ankylosis. At worst, even with consideration of repetitive movement and flare ups, the Veteran's spine was limited to 55 degrees of flexion. The Veteran also does not have any physician prescribed episodes of bed rest. The requirements of Sharp and Correia are met. Therefore, the evidence does not support the assignment of a rating higher than the currently assigned 20 percent for the time period on appeal.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements regarding his symptoms. The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, and the Board finds him to be credible, but his lay symptoms do not provide any basis upon which to assign any higher rating. While the Board notes the legal finding that the spine was later increased to 30 percent from December 2023, the evidence window for this claim closed in May 2022. Therefore, the claim for an increased rating is denied. 

Therefore, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for a low back disorder for the time period on appeal and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

11. Entitlement to an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy, right lower extremity

12. Entitlement to an increased evaluation in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy, left lower extremity

The Veteran's radiculopathies of the right and left sciatic nerves are assigned 10 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 8520. Under Diagnostic Code 8520, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis; a 20 percent evaluation is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis; a 40 percent evaluation is warranted for moderately severe incomplete paralysis; a 60 percent evaluation is warranted for severe, with marked muscular atrophy, incomplete paralysis; and the highest evaluation of 80 percent evaluation is warranted for complete paralysis where the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

According to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means not severe. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. Id. p 798. "Severe" means inflicting pain or distress; of a great degree, serious. Id. p 1140.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type-picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves.

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately-severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. However, although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 and conduct its own analysis before determining whether the M21-1 provisions may be relied upon to support its decision, thereby fulfilling part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases for its decision. See Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 263-64 (2018).

The M21-1 offers the following guidance on cases where a peripheral nerve disability is only manifested by sensory impairment: "The mild level of evaluation would be more reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are recurrent but not continuous, assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or affecting a smaller area in the nerve distribution. Reserve the moderate level of evaluation for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement. These are cases where the sensory symptoms are continuous, the symptoms are assigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment and/or they affect a larger area in the nerve distribution." M21-1, III. iv. 4. N. 4.b.

"Moderately severe" incomplete paralysis is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123. This term would be appropriate for "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy, see the criteria for a severe evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. M21-1, III. iv. 4. N. 4.c.

The M21-1 further provides, for "severe" incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve, with which marked muscle atrophy is expected. In general, severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve involves motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Id. "Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve." Id.  

Private treatment records from November 2018 show the Veteran denied radiating pain, numbness, and tingling down his legs and feet. He endorsed weakness in his legs. 

In a June 2019 VA spine examination, the Veteran reported pain and weakness in his thighs. Straight leg raising tests were negative and the examiner noted no evidence of a radiculopathy.

In a December 2020 VA hip and thigh conditions examination, the VA examiner noted reduced muscle strength on the right with no muscle atrophy.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2021. The examiner noted symptoms of a radiculopathy. The examiner noted mild intermittent pain and paresthesias of the right and left lower extremities and the involvement of both sciatic nerves.

In an April 2022 VA examination report, the Veteran reported bilateral radiculopathies with left big toe numbness. A sensory examination showed decreased sensation in the left foot/toes. Reflex examinations were normal. Regarding radicular symptoms, the examiner noted mild intermittent pain and paresthesias and moderate numbness of the left lower extremity. Involvement of the sciatic nerves was indicated.  

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence of record is against ratings in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathies of the left and right lower extremities. The objective medical evidence of the VA examination reports supports a finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathies are mild. The Board has considered the April 2022 VA examiner's finding of moderate left big toe numbness.  However, all the other findings are of mild severity. Moreover, Diagnostic Code 8520 for the sciatic nerve contemplates the area from the knee through the entire foot and the moderate symptom affects only his big toe, which constitutes only a small area of the Veteran's affected nerve. The Veteran did not have atrophy or abnormal reflexes. Therefore, the evidence is consistent with the M21-1 guidelines and supports a finding of, at worst, mild incomplete paralysis of the left and right lower extremities.

The Board has carefully considered the Veteran's assertions regarding the severity of his radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities. He is competent to state how he experiences symptoms, such as pain, that require only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). However, he is not competent to identify the specific level of disability according to the relevant diagnostic codes. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). His opinions are outweighed by the objective medical evidence of record, which shows that he is not entitled to evaluations in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathies of the left and right lower extremities.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for evaluations in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathies of the left and right lower extremities. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

13. Entitlement to a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction

The Veteran contends his service-connected erectile dysfunction is more severe than is reflected by the currently assigned noncompensable rating. As previously noted, in the November 2020 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for ED and assigned a noncompensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7522. The Veteran was also granted special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a) on account of loss of use of a creative organ. Additionally, the Board notes that in the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran also appealed the grant of SMC based the loss of use of creative organ, indicating that he believes he is entitled to a higher evaluation for that disability in addition to appealing the initial evaluation for erectile dysfunction.

Diagnostic Code 7522 was amended effective November 14, 2021. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Genitourinary Diseases and Conditions, 86 Fed. Reg. 54081 (Sept. 30, 2021). Diagnostic Code 7522 now provides for a single noncompensable rating for erectile dysfunction (ED), with or without penile deformity. Footnote 1 provides for review for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ. The Supplemental Information in the Proposed Rule indicates that VA provides disability compensation for disorders that result in reduced earning capacity and ED, with or without penile deformity, is not associated with reductions in earning capacity. See Proposed Rule, 84 Fed. Reg. 55086 (Oct. 15, 2019).

Prior to the amendment, Diagnostic Code 7522 applied provided for a single 20 percent rating for penis, deformity, with loss of erectile power. In Williams v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 134, 138 (2018), the Court noted that, "[a]lthough DC 7522 requires a "deformity" for a compensable rating, VA has not expressly defined this term." The Court defined deformity as a "distortion of any part or general disfigurement of the body," to include internal and external deformities. Id. (citing Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478 (32d ed. 2012).

When a regulation changes during the pendency of a claim, the amended version may be applied from its effective date and the former version for the entire appeal period, depending on which version is more favorable to the claimant. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In this case, as discussed below, the former version is more favorable and will be applied.

The Federal Circuit recently addressed rating ED by analogy pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 under the former version of Diagnostic Code 7522 in Webb v. McDonough, 71 F.4th 1377 (2023). Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.20, "When an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous." ED was an unlisted condition until the 2021 amendment. In Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 350 (1992), the Court explained that in deciding whether a listed disease is "closely related" to the unlisted one, VA may take into consideration the functions affected, the anatomical location, and the symptomatology of the disorders. Webb, 71 F.4th at 1380. The Board and the Court err when they require a showing that the unlisted condition "strictly meet the requirements of DC 7522 as if directly rat[ing] under that code." Id.

Under Diagnostic Code 7522, a noncompensable rating is warranted for erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity. A noncompensable rating is the only schedular rating provided under this Code. A note indicates that, when evaluating any claim involving loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs, refer to 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 to determine whether the veteran may be entitled to SMC. As noted above, that the Veteran is already in receipt of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a) due to loss of use of a creative organ.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2020. The examiner noted the Veteran's reports of erectile dysfunction. His treatment plan included taking continuous medication. The Veteran did not have an orchiectomy, renal or voiding dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, or infections of the male reproductive organs. A physical examination of his penis and testes was normal.

Upon review of the record, the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating is denied. A noncompensable rating is the only rating available under Diagnostic Code 7522. There is no evidence of record indicating the Veteran has penile deformity or renal or voiding dysfunction that would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code and the Veteran has not requested evaluation under any alternative rating criteria. His sole argument for a compensable rating is grounded in loss of erectile power, and the award of SMC is based on that symptom.

Moreover, the Board finds no evidence in the record that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction was "exceptional or unusual," due to factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. Thus, referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1); Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366, 1368. The Veteran also does not argue otherwise.

Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply and a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

14. Entitlement to increased SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ

SMC is a special statutory award granted in addition to awards based on the schedular evaluations provided by the diagnostic codes in VA's Rating Schedule. Claims for SMC are governed by 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) through (s) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 and 3.352.

SMC is payable at a specified rate if the Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a). 

The rate of SMC compensation is a specific value that is adjusted annually, independent of any other awarded compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k).

Here, the Veteran is currently in receipt of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ based upon the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction. The law does not provide for a higher rate of SMC for loss of use of a creative organ. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k). SMC rates are determined by statute and are not subject to the Board's discretion; the Board is specifically prohibited from granting benefits that are not authorized by law. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (c); McTighe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 29, 30 (1994). As the disposition of this case is based on law and not the facts of this case, the claim must be denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
