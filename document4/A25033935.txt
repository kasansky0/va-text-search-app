ORDER

An effective date of September 13, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of Dependency and Indemnity (DIC) for service connection for the cause of death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's original claim for service connection for lung cancer was denied in an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision dated January 15, 2019.  The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 on March 29, 2019 for service connection for lung cancer, citing to the January 2019 rating decision.  Subsequently, the appeal was docketed at the Board.

2. On August 11, 2019, the Veteran died and on September 13, 2019 the surviving spouse/appellant filed a VA Form 21-534ez application for DIC along with the death certificate (which listed squamous cell lung cancer (immediate cause of death) and atrial fibrillation (other significant conditions contributing to death but not resulting in squamous cell lung cancer)), and a request for substitution.

3. On October 9, 2019, the Board issued a death dismissal for the issues of service connection for carcinoma of the nasopharynx and service connection for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, but did not dismiss the issue of service connection for lung cancer.

4. On November 20, 2019, the appellant submitted a Statement in Support of Claim (SISOC) showing that she was aware of the appeal pending before the Board at the time of the Veteran's death, however, she was not yet properly substituted in as claimant.

5. On December 6, 2019, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying service connection for the cause of death, finding the Veteran's lung cancer did not warrant service connection, and that the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease (CAD) was not related to atrial fibrillation (AFib).  

6. However, on December 23, 2019, the AOJ issued a deferred rating stating that the issue of service connection for lung cancer pending at the time of the Veteran's death is intertwined with the issue of service connection for the cause of death from lung cancer.  

7. As the issue of service connection for lung cancer is inextricably intertwined with the issue of service connection for the cause of death from lung cancer, the issue of service connection for the cause of death will remain pending until the issue of service connection for lung cancer is finally adjudicated.

8. Thereafter, on April 27, 2020, substitution was granted to the appellant, and she filed a 21-534EZ application for DIC on December 21, 2022, along with an SISOC. In the SISOC, she stated that she is still waiting for adjudication of the appeal dated March 29, 2019 pending before the Board regarding the issue of service connection for lung cancer.

9. Finally, on August 6, 2023, the Board issued a decision with regard to the appeal dated March 29, 2019.  In the decision, the Board found that the January 15, 2019 rating decision on appeal was a Legacy decision, as it was issued prior to February 19, 2019.  Therefore, the appeal was docketed in error under the modernized review system (AMA), and the issue of service connection for lung cancer was remanded for a Statement of the Case (SOC) per Legacy procedure.

10. On August 15, 2023, an SOC was issued denying service connection for lung cancer followed by a January 25, 2024 rating decision denying service connection for the cause of death.  

11. On March 20, 2024, the appellant filed another VA Form 21-534EZ application for DIC, this time claiming service connection for the cause of death due to AFib's relation to the Veteran's service-connected CAD.

12. Although the appellant submitted a new theory of entitlement to service connection for the cause of death (i.e. AFib as a result of CAD), both theories of entitlement (lung cancer as primary cause of death, and CAD as contributory cause of death) ultimately stem from the issue of service connection for the cause of death.  Therefore, the issue of service connection for the cause of death was continuously pursued from the August 15, 2023 SOC denying service connection for lung cancer until the AOJ granted DIC in its June 28, 2024 rating decision.

13. The September 13, 2019 original claim for DIC remained pending until the August 15, 2023 SOC denying service connection for lung cancer because the two issues are inextricably intertwined, and from there, the DIC claim was continuously pursued until the AOJ granted DIC in its June 28, 2024 rating decision. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of September 13, 2019, but no earlier, for service connection for the cause of death are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1970 to May 1974.  The Veteran died in August 2019 and the appellant is his surviving spouse.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision issued in July 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying an effective date earlier than December 21, 2022 for the award of DIC for service connection for the cause of death. 

Procedurally, in a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted the appellant's claim for service connection for the cause of death.  In the subsequent notification letter dated July 11, 2024, the AOJ assigned an effective date of December 21, 2022 for the award of DIC.  On July 18, 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the June 2024 rating decision (notification on July 11, 2024).  On July 29, 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2024 decision.  In the July 2024 HLR decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of DIC.  Thereafter, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the July 2024 HLR decision and electing the Board's Direct Review docket.  

The Board notes that in both the July 2024 HLR request and the August 2024 appeal to the Board, the appellant contended that the AOJ committed a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) regarding the effective date for the grant of DIC.  See July 18, 2024 VA Form 21-4138; August 20, 2024 VA Form 21-4138.  The AOJ did not adjudicate the issue of CUE included in that July 18, 2024 review request.  A CUE motion or request must be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance and separately appealed to the Board.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 333 (2006).  Therefore, the Board cannot adjudicate that issue.  The appellant may resubmit the claim to the AOJ or notify the AOJ that the issue is still pending.

Lastly, based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of July 11, 2024-the date of the notification assigning an effective date for DIC which prompted the Veteran's selection of the HLR review lane.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 3.2601(f).  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after July 11, 2024 for this issue, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Effective Dates

The statutory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the latter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service.  For reopened claims, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). 

However, the term "continuous pursuit" only applies to AMA decisions.  Specifically, when a claim filed under AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement.  Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(h), 3.2500(f).  In the event there were an AMA opt-in from an SOC or SSOC, the resulting AMA decisions (either by the AOJ or Board) would be issued in the AMA; therefore, only they, not the claims before the AMA opt-in, would be subject to continuous pursuit.  See id.

In the legacy appeals system, effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that in order to be considered a valid claim, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form.  79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015).  However, this amendment only applies to claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Id. at 57,686. 

Under the law prior to the amendment, a claim was defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014) (amended 2015).  An informal claim was any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits that identifies the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014) (repealed 2015).  Under the law at the time, VA had an obligation to look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims-formal and informal-for benefits and was required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits.  Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).  In addition, in cases involving previously denied claims reports of examination or hospitalization from VA or a uniformed service or private medical records may constitute informal claims to reopen.  38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b).

Upon receipt of an informal claim for benefits, if a formal claim for benefits had not been filed, VA was required to provide the Veteran with a formal claim form for the Veteran to complete and return.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014).  If a formal claim for benefits was then filed within one year of the date the formal claim form was sent to the Veteran, the formal claim was considered to have been filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  Id. 

Following the March 2015 amendment, a claim for benefits must be filed on the standardized claim form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151.  A veteran may also indicate their intent to file a claim for compensation by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) (2017).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA must provide the claimant with the appropriate claims form.  Id.  If a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary is received by VA within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the formal claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  Id.  An intent to file a claim must be submitted using one of three approved methods and must identify the general benefit and the claimant.  Id.

Entitlement to an effective date of September 13, 2019, but no earlier, for service connection for the cause of death is granted.

The appellant contends that the effective date assigned for service connection for the cause of death should be earlier than December 21, 2022.

In the current appeal, service connection for the cause of death was granted in a rating decision dated June 28, 2024.  The AOJ subsequently assigned an effective date of December 21, 2022 for the award of DIC, based on the date of receipt of a claim to readjudicate service connection for the cause of death.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-534EZ; July 11, 2024 Notification Letter.  

Prior to the appellant's December 21, 2022 claim for DIC, the Veteran had previously filed an original claim for service connection for his lung cancer disability which was received on December 4, 2018.  See December 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ.  That service connection claim was denied on the merits in a rating decision issued on January 15, 2019, followed by a timely appeal received on March 29, 2019.  See March 2019 VA Form 10182 (citing the January 15, 2019 rating decision).  Subsequently, the appeal was docketed at the Board.  See July 3, 2019 Appeal Process Request Letter.  

On August 11, 2019, the Veteran died and the surviving spouse/appellant filed an application for DIC along with the death certificate and a request for substitution.  See September 13, 2019 VA Form 21-534EZ.  The Veteran's death certificate lists the immediate cause of death as squamous cell lung cancer, and the contributory cause of death as atrial fibrillation (AFib).  See September 13, 2019 Death Certificate.

On October 9, 2019, the Board issued a death dismissal for the issues of service connection for carcinoma of the nasopharynx and service connection for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, but did not dismiss the issue of service connection for lung cancer. 

On November 20, 2019, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (SISOC) stating, "My husband had an appeal in place at time of his death for lung cancer and I am now the Substitute Claimant for this claim."  This demonstrates that the appellant is aware of the appeal pending before the Board at the time of the Veteran's death, however, the Board notes that she was not yet properly substituted in as claimant.

On December 6, 2019, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying service connection for the cause of death, finding the Veteran's lung cancer did not warrant service connection, and that the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease (CAD) was not related to the contributory cause of death, AFib.  In a letter dated December 21, 2019, VA notified the appellant of that decision.  However, on December 23, 2019, the AOJ issued a deferred rating stating that, "The appeal issues pending at death are intertwined with the cause of death from lung cancer (not primary)."  As the pending issue of service connection for lung cancer is inextricably intertwined with the issue of service connection for the cause of death, the Board finds that the issue of service connection for the cause of death remained pending until the issue of service connection for lung cancer is finally adjudicated.

Thereafter, on April 27, 2020, substitution was granted to the appellant, and on December 21, 2022 she filed another application for DIC, along with an SISOC.  See April 2020 Notification Letter; December 2022 VA Form 21-534EZ.  

Generally, veterans have one year from the mailing date of the notice of a rating decision to file a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) with that decision.  Here, the AOJ issued a rating decision on December 6, 2019 that denied service connection for the cause of death, and the appellant did not file an NOD within the 1-year appellate period following the December 21, 2019 notice of that rating decision.  Therefore, the December 2019 rating decision should have become final.  However, as set forth above, the issue of service connection for the cause of death remained pending until the issue of service connection for lung cancer is finally adjudicated because the issues are inextricably intertwined.  As the March 2019 appeal for service connection for lung cancer is still pending, the issue of service connection for the cause of death is also still pending.  Therefore, the December 2019 rating decision did not become final and an earlier effective date of September 13, 2019 was preserved.

Furthermore, in the SISOC submitted with the December 2022 application for DIC, the appellant stated, "I have not received any correspondence concerning his appeal for the lung cancer since I was granted eligibility as the Substitute Claimant....My husband received a letter from the BVA dated 07/03/2019 for his appeal for lung cancer via VAF 10182... I hope you will review my file and see if the appeal has just been dropped or overlooked since it has been since 2019 since all this took place."  See December 2022 VA Form 21-4138.  This demonstrates that the appellant is still waiting for adjudication of the appeal dated March 29, 2019 regarding the issue of service connection for lung cancer, which was pending before the Board at the time of the Veteran's death.  The record shows that the AOJ found that she is a proper substitute claimant (for that appeal) on April 27, 2020.

Finally, on August 6, 2023, the Board issued a decision with regard to the appeal dated March 29, 2019.  In the decision, the Board found that the January 15, 2019 rating decision on appeal was a Legacy decision, as it was issued prior to February 19, 2019.  Therefore, the appeal was docketed under the modernized review system (AMA) in error.  Under the legacy system, the AOJ must first issue a Statement of the Case (SOC) in response to a timely filed Notice of Disagreement (NOD), before the Veteran can (if he so chooses) appeal the case to the Board.  As such, the issue of service connection for lung cancer was remanded for issuance of an SOC per Legacy procedure.  See Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238 (1999).  See also July 28, 2023 BVA Letter (stating that the July 3, 2019 docketing letter was erroneous).

On August 15, 2023, the AOJ issued an SOC that denied service connection for lung cancer on the merits, followed by a rating decision dated January 25, 2024 that denied service connection for the cause of death.  

Subsequently, on March 20, 2024 the appellant filed another VA Form 21-534EZ application for DIC, this time claiming service connection for the cause of death due to AFib's relation to the Veteran's service-connected CAD.  See March 20, 2024 VA Form 21-4138 SISOC; March 20, 2024 Correspondence (article finding AFib higher in those with CAD).  In response, the AOJ requested a medical opinion regarding service connection for the cause of death based on the Veteran's service-connected CAD.  The June 2024 VA clinician provided a positive nexus opinion, stating that the Veteran's contributory cause of death, AFib, was at least as likely as not caused by his service-connected CAD.  See June 26, 2024 C&P Exam.  Based on that opinion, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for the cause of death in a rating decision dated June 28, 2024.

The Board finds that although the appellant submitted a new theory of entitlement for service connection for the cause of death (i.e. AFib as a result of CAD) in March 2024, both theories of entitlement (lung cancer as primary cause of death, and CAD as contributory cause of death) ultimately stem from the issue of service connection for the cause of death.  38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.  As the March 2024 application for DIC was filed within the 1-year appellate period following the January 2024 rating decision denying DIC, the Board finds that the issue of service connection for the cause of death was continuously pursued from the August 2023 SOC denying service connection for lung cancer until the AOJ granted DIC in its June 28, 2024 rating decision.

?

In sum, the September 13, 2019 original claim for DIC remained pending until the August 15, 2023 SOC finally adjudicated service connection for lung cancer because the two issues are inextricably intertwined, and from there, the DIC claim was continuously pursued until the AOJ granted DIC in its June 28, 2024 rating decision.  As such, the earlier effective date of September 13, 2019 for the appellant's DIC claim was preserved.  Based on the foregoing, an effective date of September 13, 2019, but no earlier, is assigned for the award of DIC.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
