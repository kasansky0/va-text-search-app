ORDER

Entitlement to eligibility for financial assistance for automobile or other conveyance, and/or adaptive equipment is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is service connected for posttraumatic stress disorder, to include depression and anxiety, (PTSD), as well as obstructive sleep disorder.

2. The Veteran's service-connected disabilities do not include loss or loss of use of a hand or foot, permanent vision impairment of both eyes, severe burn injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ankylosis of a knee or hip.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing eligibility for financial assistance for an automobile or adaptive equipment are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3901, 3902, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.808 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1970 to June 1973.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2019, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In June 2020, a report of telephone contact indicates that the "Veteran did not receive notification letter".  VA Form 27-0820, June 2020.  In July 2020, the notification letter was sent to the Veteran.

In July 2020, a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Hearing docket was elected.  On January 16, 2024, the hearing request was withdrawn.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 notification letter, in which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) informed the Veteran of the November 2019 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the notification letter and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, in September 2017, correspondence was received from the Veteran's representative "requesting that his appeal be expedited" and indicating that the Veteran is homeless.  Third Party Correspondence, September 2017.  Accordingly,

the Board finds that the appeal shall be advanced on the docket.  38 U.S.C. § 7107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

Entitlement to eligibility for financial assistance for automobile or other conveyance, and/or adaptive equipment.

The Board finds that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for eligibility for financial assistance for automobile or other conveyance, and/or adaptive equipment.

In September 2019, a VA Form 21-4502 was received.  The Veteran indicated that he is applying for an automobile.  He indicated that he has "permanent impairment of vision", to include "central visual acuity 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses", as well as "contraction of the peripheral field of vision to 20 degrees or less in the better eye".  VA Form 21-4502, September 2019 (capitalizations omitted).

Financial assistance may be provided to an "eligible person" in acquiring an automobile or other conveyance and adaptive equipment, or adaptive equipment only.  38 U.S.C. § 3902(a)(b).  Eligibility for assistance to purchase a vehicle and adaptive equipment is warranted where one of the following exists as the result of injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active service: (1) loss or permanent loss of use of one or both feet; (2) loss or permanent loss of use of one or both hands; (3) permanent impairment of vision of both eyes, meaning central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye, with corrective glasses, or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a field defect in which the peripheral field has contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye; (4) severe burn injury precluding effective operation of an automobile; (5) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; or, (6) for adaptive equipment only, ankylosis of one or both knees or one or both hips.  38 U.S.C. § 3901; 38 C.F.R. § 3.808.  

The Veteran is service connected for PTSD, as well as obstructive sleep disorder.  Accordingly, the Board does not see that the Veteran is service connected for a disability that would qualify under the criteria listed above.  See Rating Decision - Codesheet, June 2022.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has alleged an eye disability.  See VA Form 21-4502, September 2019.  However, again, the Board does not see that either of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are an eye disability.

The Board acknowledges a February 2024 memorandum from the Veteran's representative.  This memorandum identifies two Board appeals, including the one presently before the Board.  However, the Board does not see further argument or evidence submitted with the memorandum that would be germane to this appeal.  The memorandum primarily addresses the other appeal; indeed, it states that "the most important contentions are" those from the other appeal, namely the Veteran's pursuit of a higher evaluation for his PTSD, as well as entitlement to a TDIU.  Third Party Correspondence, February 2024.  The Board acknowledges that the memorandum also references "a sworn statement from" the Veteran, as well as an "attached . . . competent expert opinion".  Third Party Correspondence, February 2024.  The Board does not see either document included with the memorandum.  However, based on statements in the memorandum describing these documents, they appear to pertain to "the most important contentions" of the Veteran's PTSD evaluation and entitlement to a TDIU, not the issue addressed herein.  Third Party Correspondence, February 2024.

?

Accordingly, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities meet any of the criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 3.808.  Therefore, entitlement to eligibility for financial assistance for automobile or other conveyance, and/or adaptive equipment is denied.
