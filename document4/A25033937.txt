DOCKET NO. 240712-455376
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The issue of the propriety of the proposed reduction in the rating of the Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, insomnia and traumatic brain injury with postconcussion syndrome (psychiatric disorder) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On August 5, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of the appeal regarding the issue of the propriety of the proposed reduction in rating for psychiatric disorder is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran involving the propriety of the proposed reduction in the rating of the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served active duty in the Navy from February 2018 to September 2023.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a June 2024 rating decision from the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) that proposed a reduction of the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder from 70 percent to 0 percent. The Veteran appealed the June 2024 rating decision through the submission of a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, in July 2024, selecting the Hearing docket. 

The Board notes that the June 2024 rating decision was only a proposal and did not effectuate the proposed reduction. The Veteran may not appeal a proposed reduction as it is not a decision that can be appealed to the Board because the factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. Cf. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d).  However, in written correspondence from the Veteran received in August 2024, the Veteran withdrew his current appeal relating to the proposed reduction in the June 2024 rating decision. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id.

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal regarding the proposed reduction of the rating for his service-connected psychiatric disability. In correspondence from the Veteran received in August 2024, the Veteran submitted a formal request to withdraw and cancel the current appeal. Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
