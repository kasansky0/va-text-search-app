FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively supports that a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes has not been shown during the pendency of the appeal, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 

2. The evidence persuasively supports that right elbow pain, left hand pain, and left hip pain have not been shown during the pendency of the appeal, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

3. The Veteran was discharged from his last period of military service on September 30, 2023. The effective date of October 1, 2023 is the earliest date permitted under law and is the date assigned for the award of service connection for the following disabilities: trochanteric pain syndrome of the right hip; DEA; lumbosacral strain; erectile dysfunction; frequent urination; GERD; SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ; cervical strain; temporomandibular joint disorder on the left; skin condition, rash and other nonspecific skin eruption; left ankle tendonitis; tinnitus; right ankle tendonitis; left elbow limitation of flexion; pes planus on the left foot; residuals of right hand fracture, long finger; left knee recurrent patellar dislocation, left knee instability, patellar instability, patellofemoral pain syndrome with degenerative arthritis; right lower extremity radiculopathy; left lower extremity radiculopathy; medial epicondylitis left elbow; right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome; shin split on the right and left; scars of the left upper extremity; residuals of a left shoulder rotator cuff surgery with pain; sleep apnea; right shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis; temporomandibular joint disorder on the right; left upper radiculopathy to include left upper long thoracic nerve; right upper radiculopathy to include right upper long thoracic nerve; left wrist strain; and right wrist strain.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2001 to September 2001 and from September 2001 to September 2023.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024 and February 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal and February 2024 AOJ decision regarding the right hip. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

1. Service Connection for Hearing Loss

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the January 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the January 2024 rating decision included a favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's active service, specifically noting that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was that of a Helicopter Pilot, which would have exposed him to potentially hazardous noise on a regular basis. 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland (MD) CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects his primary specialty included an aviation warfare officer for 18 years and seven months, which, as noted above, would support exposure to excessive noise during active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). 

During the pendency of the appeal, there have been no auditory thresholds in any of the relevant frequencies at 40 decibels or greater, there were not three frequencies at greater than 26 decibels for the left ear, and the speech recognition score was above 94 percent, thereby not meeting the criteria to qualify as a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The results of the audiometric testing in the November 2023 VA examination are as follows: 

			HERTZ		

					

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	10	5	10	15

LEFT	15	10	10	10	15

Speech discrimination scores using the MD CNC word recognition list revealed findings of 100 percent in both ears. Although the Veteran reported having intermittent issues in noisy situations, the results of audiometric testing do not reveal a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997). Here, the VA hearing examination findings are not sufficient to establish a current right or left ear hearing loss disability during the period on appeal for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. During the period on appeal, the evidence of record demonstrated the Veteran was evaluated to have normal hearing in both ears by a VA examiner. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

While the Veteran is competent to report his observations of hearing loss, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and knowledge of bodily systems. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which does not demonstrate a current diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes. 

Without competent evidence of a diagnosis of a hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the Board must deny the Veteran's claim. The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against service connection for hearing loss, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Service Connection for Right Elbow Pain

3. Service Connection for Left Hand Pain

4. Service Connection for Left Hip Pain

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the January 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, there were no favorable findings for the right elbow, left hand or left hip in the January 2024 rating decision. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not had a current diagnosis of right elbow pain, left hand pain or left hip pain at any time during the pendency of the claims. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Post-service medical records reflect no diagnoses of right elbow pain, left hand pain, or left hip pain at any time throughout the duration of the appeal. November 2023 and December 2023 VA examinations reflect no findings, complaints or diagnoses of right elbow pain, left hand pain or left hip pain. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Although a June 2023 Service Member Identification And Self-Assessment worksheet reflects the Veteran reported pain in the left hand after fracturing several bones in 2012, this was reported and diagnosed as a right hand fracture in the November 2023 VA examination of the hand and fingers. The November 2023 VA examination of the hand and fingers also reflects no complaints of a left hand problem and no diagnosis of a left hand disability. Although a June 2023 Service Member Identification And Self-Assessment worksheet reflects that the Veteran reported pain in both hips, the November 2023 VA examination of the hips reflects he only reported a history of right hip injury and current right hip problems and was diagnosed with a right hip disability. Likewise, while the Veteran reported pain in both elbows in the June 2023 Service Member Identification And Self-Assessment worksheet, he reported having an injury in service and left elbow pain since that time, with no complaints regarding the right elbow in a November 2023 VA examination of the elbows and forearms. At that time, he was diagnosed with a left elbow disability. 

The Board notes that the record is absent of any post-service medical records showing any diagnoses of a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability. However, the Board notes that consideration of the functional impairment of earning capacity resulting from the Veteran's claimed disabilities must be given if no diagnosis is of record. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Board finds the available evidence of record does not show symptoms of a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability that have impaired the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks. Thus, the Veteran's claimed disabilities have not demonstrated functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1368.

Regarding the Veteran's a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability, aside from the Veteran's bare assertion of entitlement to service connection for these conditions as several of a number of claimed conditions on his June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, he has made no other statements concerning these conditions. Thus, the Veteran's claimed disabilities have not demonstrated functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1368.

While the Veteran is competent to report past treatment and lay observations, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and knowledge of bodily systems. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which does not demonstrate a current diagnosis a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability during the period of the appeal. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997). During the period on appeal, the evidence of record did not demonstrate any confirmed diagnosis a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability at any time during the period of the appeal. In this case, entitlement to service connection for right elbow pain, left hand pain or left hip pain cannot be established without the requested medical evidence. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Without competent evidence of a diagnosis of a right elbow disability, left hand disability or left hip disability, the Board must deny the Veteran's claims. The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against the claims for service connection for right elbow pain, left hand pain or left hip pain it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Effective Date

Generally, and except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim for disability compensation, i.e., service connection, is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

The effective date for an increase will typically be the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). However, for an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). For earlier effective date increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998). 

Under former regulations pertaining to legacy appeals, prior to February 19, 2019, a rating decision becomes final and binding if the Veteran does not timely perfect an appeal of the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.1103. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim after notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. After a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for trochanteric pain syndrome of the right hip, DEA, lumbosacral strain, erectile dysfunction, frequent urination, GERD, SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ, cervical strain, temporomandibular joint disorder on the left, skin condition, rash and other nonspecific skin eruption, left ankle tendonitis, tinnitus, right ankle tendonitis, left elbow limitation of flexion, pes planus on the left foot, residuals of right hand fracture, long finger, left knee recurrent patellar dislocation, left knee instability, patellar instability, patellofemoral pain syndrome with degenerative arthritis, right lower extremity radiculopathy, left lower extremity radiculopathy, medial epicondylitis left elbow, right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, shin split on the right and left, scars of the left upper extremity, residuals of a left shoulder rotator cuff surgery with pain, sleep apnea, right shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, temporomandibular joint disorder on the right, left upper radiculopathy to include left upper long thoracic nerve, right upper radiculopathy to include right upper long thoracic nerve, left wrist strain, and right wrist strain.

In this case, a review of the record reveals that the Veteran's claims for service connection were received by VA on June 7, 2023. The Veteran's last day of active duty was on September 30, 2023. In a January 2024 rating decision and February 2024 rating decision, the RO awarded service connection for the above noted disabilities and assigned ratings, effective October 1, 2023, the day after the Veteran's separation from active service.

Upon a review of the record, the Board finds the appropriate effective date for the grant service connection for the above disabilities is October 1, 2023, the day after the Veteran's discharge from active duty. The claim leading to the award of service connection was received by VA on June 7, 2023, while the Veteran was still in active service. As the claim was received within one year of discharge, the Veteran was assigned an effective date of October 1, 2023.

As the Veteran has already been assigned an effective date that is the day following his separation from service, no earlier effective date is legally possible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). The Veteran has not presented any argument regarding why he believes an earlier effective date is warranted or indicated that his DD Form 214 separation date is incorrect.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention on his June 2024 VA Form 10182 that his retroactive compensation payment for his service-connected disabilities did not include the month of October 2023. However, the Board notes that regardless of VA regulations concerning effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits will not begin until the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31. Therefore, as the Veteran's service connection awards became effective in October 2023, his first payment would not begin until November 1, 2023. 

As there is no legal basis to allow for an effective date prior to October 1, 2023 for the award of service connection for trochanteric pain syndrome of the right hip, DEA, lumbosacral strain, erectile dysfunction, frequent urination, GERD, SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ, cervical strain, temporomandibular joint disorder on the left, skin condition, rash and other nonspecific skin eruption, left ankle tendonitis, tinnitus, right ankle tendonitis, left elbow limitation of flexion, pes planus on the left foot, residuals of right hand fracture, long finger, left knee recurrent patellar dislocation, left knee instability, patellar instability, patellofemoral pain syndrome with degenerative arthritis, right lower extremity radiculopathy, left lower extremity radiculopathy, medial epicondylitis left elbow, right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome, shin split on the right and left, scars of the left upper extremity, residuals of a left shoulder rotator cuff surgery with pain, sleep apnea, right shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis with acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, temporomandibular joint disorder on the right, left upper radiculopathy to include left upper long thoracic nerve, right upper radiculopathy to include right upper long thoracic nerve, left wrist strain, and right wrist strain, these claims must be denied as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
