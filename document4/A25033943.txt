ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 18, 2024, for the payment of additional dependency compensation benefits for the Veteran's stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K., is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c, dated July 26, 2022, listing M.K., D.K. and J.K. as his stepchildren.

2. At the time of the April 26, 2023, VA administrative decision on appeal, the Veteran had not submitted any information to VA identifying his current spouse, N.K., or confirming the relationship of his three stepchildren as the biological children of his current spouse.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to February 18, 2024, for the payment of additional dependency compensation benefits for the Veteran's stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K., have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1115, 5101, 5110, 5124; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57, 3.204, 3.401. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2006 to November 2006, and from February 2008 to May 2011. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 administrative decision which removed the Veteran's former spouse, R., and two of his stepchildren, E.M.G. and S.M.G., from his award of dependency benefits. He appealed directly to the Board and chose the Direct docket. See April 2023 VA Form 10182. The Board may only consider evidence of record as of the April 2023 decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

In his Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran contested the fact that three new stepchildren were not added to his award of dependency benefits. Subsequently, in a July 2024 decision, the Veteran was awarded additional dependency benefits for his new spouse, N.K., and three stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K. Although this occurred outside the applicable evidentiary window, the Board is permitted to consider the effect of rating decisions issued after the rating decision on appeal. The subsequent rating decision is not new evidence, but rather, a new legal finding. The Board has therefore recharacterized the issue on appeal to consider the favorable legal finding made in this subsequent rating decision.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to July February 18, 2024, for the payment of additional dependency compensation benefits for the Veteran's stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K.

The Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for the grant of additional compensation for his dependent stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K., who are each the biological children of his present spouse, N.K.

Veterans having a service-connected disability that is compensated at 30 percent or more may be entitled to additional compensation for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115. The effective date of such an award will be the latest of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) the effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) the date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for dependents is the date of the Veteran's marriage or birth/adoption of a child, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of the VA request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(1). An award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (f).

The earliest that the additional award of compensation for a dependent child can occur is the first day of the month following the effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

In certain circumstances, stepchildren may also be considered "children" for the purposes of additional dependency compensation. The regulation defining what constitutes a "child" for these purposes includes "a stepchild who acquired that status before the age of 18 years and who is a member of the veteran's household or was a member of the veteran's household at the time of the veteran's death." 38 C.F.R. § 3.57 (a)(1). The term "stepchild" is further defined as "a legitimate or an illegitimate child of the veteran's spouse." 38 C.F.R. § 3.57 (a)(2).

Initially, the Board observes that the Veteran has been in receipt of at least a 30 percent combined rating for his service-connected disabilities since May 21, 2011. Accordingly, the Veteran has been rated appropriately to receive additional compensation for all time periods relevant to his current appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1115.

Unfortunately, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of dependency benefits for his stepchildren, M.K, D.K. and J.K. A review of the evidence of record shows that in July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, which listed his three stepchildren. While the Veteran indicated that M.K., D.K. and J.K. were his stepchildren, he failed to answer questions on the form asking whether any of the listed children were biological children of his spouse. This form also failed to provide any information about his present spouse, N.K. Further, at the time of the April 2023 decision on appeal, the Veteran had not submitted any information either confirming the identity of his present spouse or establishing the relationship of his stepchildren as the biological children of his present spouse. 

The Veteran's earlier effective date claim fails because of absence of legal merit or lack of entitlement under the law, and as such, the claim must be denied. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
