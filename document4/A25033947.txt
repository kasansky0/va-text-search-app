REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1993 to November 2003.

The present appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) following an August 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision. The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in October 2024. He elected the Direct docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was notified of the AOJ August 2024 decision on appeal on August 6, 2024 which is within one year of the issuance of this decision, and the opportunity to request a different Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, docket has not fully expired. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 311 (2024). However, the Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams.

Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain.

The Veteran seeks service connection for his current low back disability. He contends his low back pain is due to or related to an in-service motor vehicle accident. See November 2020 VA 21-4138 Statement In Support of Claim. Following a review of the evidence, the Board finds a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

VA has a duty to assist veterans and must provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion when such examination or opinion is necessary to decide the claim. 38?U.S.C. §?5103A(d)(1). Whenever VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 312 (2007). A medical opinion is adequate when it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one. Id, at 311. 

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in March 2022 and June 2023. Neither of the examiner's opinions adequately address the Veteran's assertions and relevant medical history. The March 2022 examiner provided an opinion in June 2022 that is inadequate as it is based on inaccurate facts. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The VA examiner found that the Veteran's service treatment records were silent for complaints of low back pain in service. See June 2022 C&P Exam. However, the Veteran reported and/or was treated for low back pain in November 1994, June 1995, March 1998, and May 1999 while on active duty. See September 2015 STR - Medical; September 2015 STR - Medical. 

The June 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain was less likely than not caused by his in-service motor vehicle accident. See July 2023 C&P Exam. By way of rationale, the VA examiner emphasized that the Veteran did not report low back pain at the emergency room following the motor vehicle accident and his low back pain had its onset after reaching for a baby. The VA examiner does not discuss the proximity in time to the motor vehicle accident, the Veteran's reports of the severity of the accident, or the Veteran's consistent reports of recurring low back pain throughout his remaining active service. Notably, the VA examiner does not consider the Veteran's in-service report that pain from other injuries incurred in the accident had a "delayed onset." In that regard, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion does not adequately consider the Veteran's medical history or lay statements, and the VA examiner's opinion does not describe the disability in sufficient detail. See Barr; see also Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020) (holding that an examiner's failure to consider a Veteran's testimony when forming a medical opinion renders it inadequate).

Therefore, the Board finds a remand is necessary to cure the duty to assist error by not obtaining an adequate medical opinion prior to the decision on appeal. Remand is necessary to cure this defect.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the claims file to a qualified VA examiner for an opinion regarding the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain. The entire claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by the examiner. All necessary tests and studies should be accomplished, and the examiner should provide a complete rationale for the conclusion reached. The need for a full, in-person examination shall be left up to the discretion of the examiner.?

?

Following a review of the record and, if applicable, an in-person examination or telephone interview, the VA examiner shall opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain had its initial onset or is otherwise etiologically related to active service, to include the in-service October 1994 motor vehicle accident.

In rendering the requested opinion, the VA examiner must specifically consider and discuss, but is not limited to, the relevant evidence of record, including: 

"	The Veteran's November 2020 lay statement; 

"	The medical and lay evidence regarding the Veteran's October 1994 motor vehicle accident, to include the severity and details of the accident;

"	The Veteran's treatment for on and off low back pain in-service in November 1994, June 1995, and May 1999; 

"	The June 1995 physical therapy note that the Veteran's low back pain was similar to his cervical strain pain sustained from the motor vehicle accident; and

"	The Veteran's treatment for low back pain following active service beginning in February 2007.

The examiner must fully explain the rationale for the opinion, with citation to supporting data/lay statements, as deemed appropriate. If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, they should expressly indicate this and provide a supporting rationale as to why an opinion cannot be made without resorting to speculation.
