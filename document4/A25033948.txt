FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. The appellant filed a valid and properly executed Form 21-22a Fee Agreement in September 2020.

2. The October 2020 and November 2020 Rating Decisions, which, respectively, granted a 10 percent evaluation from September 10, 2020 for loss of sense of smell and a 10 percent evaluation from September 10, 2020 for speech changes, and denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for dementia and moderate sleep impairment, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for difficulty chewing and swallowing, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity neuropathy, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for masked facies, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for left and right upper extremity muscle rigidity with bradykinesia , denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and denied a compensable rating for loss of taste, are both the initial decisions on the claim for those benefits.

3. The appellant filed a relevant Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Supplemental Claim in October 2021, and in October 2022, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia, and unspecified depressive disorder (PTSD) from February 10, 2022, a 20 percent rating for  left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, a 10 percent rating for loss of sense of taste from February 10, 2022, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, service connection for masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and service connection for speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army, on active duty from August 1969 to February 1972. His awards include the Vietnam Service Medal and Bronze Star Medal. The appellant is his former attorney.

This appeal was before the Board in February 2023, at which time it remanded the issue of eligibility for payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the October 2022 grant of benefits. The purpose of this remand was compliance with specialized contested claims procedures. In September 2023, on the Board's motion, it vacated this remand because it was procedurally improper.

Accordingly, pursuant to contested claims procedures, a redacted copy of the appellant's substantive appeal was sent to the Veteran's address on file. In the same letters, sent to the Veteran and the appellant in February 2025, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) informed each party of the circumstances under which the Board will place the parties on the Direct docket after 30 days. In correspondence dated April 2025, the AOJ informed the parties that the appeal had been placed on the Direct docket. Accordingly, the Board finds that that there has been compliance with applicable specialized contested claims procedures.

Attorney Fees

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(1), all fee agreements must include the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number, and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(2). A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g)(3). Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (e), (f).

When a claimant and an agent or attorney have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the agent or attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether or not the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant, the total fee payable to the agent or attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1). Under VA regulations, such award of past-due benefits must result in a cash payment to a claimant or an appellant from which the fee may be deducted. Id. 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a claim reopened after a denial by a VA AOJ or the Board or the lump-sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award, as determined by applicable laws and regulations, and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the reopened claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased evaluation is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability evaluation initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(1)(i).

1. Eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the October 2022 grant of a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia, and unspecified depressive disorder (PTSD) from February 10, 2022, a 20 percent rating for  left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, a 10 percent rating for loss of sense of taste from February 10, 2022, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, service connection for masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and service connection for speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side.

Under the AMA, agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once:

"	the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements.

"	an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim, and

"	the initial decision was on a claim on or after February 19, 2019 (the effective date of the modernized decision review system). See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

An "initial decision on a claim" is the result of a valid appeal. It includes an initial decision on a request to revise a prior decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE); a decision on an initial claim for an increase in rate of benefit; or, as relevant to this appeal, an initial decision on a supplemental claim that was submitted after the final adjudication of an earlier claim. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i).

In this case, the appellant is eligible for the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from benefits resulting from the October 2022 grant of a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia, and unspecified depressive disorder (PTSD) from February 10, 2022, a 20 percent rating for  left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, a 10 percent rating for loss of sense of taste from February 10, 2022, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, service connection for masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and service connection for speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side. Specifically, the pre-decisional evidence of record shows that the requirements for withholding of attorney fees for the appellant have been met. See Cox v. McDonough, 4 Vet. App. 112 (2021).

First, the appellant complied with the regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements. Specifically, in September 2020, the Veteran and the appellant signed and countersigned VA Form 21-22a and the appellant filed a validly executed Fee Agreement. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d)(2), the Fee Agreement provides for direct payment of 20 percent of past-due benefits.

Second, the AOJ granted benefits related to PTSD, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, loss of sense of taste, difficulty chewing and swallowing, masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side based on a Supplemental Claim filed by the appellant. Specifically, in September 2015, the AOJ issued a Rating Decision granting service connection for depression with moderate sleep impairment, with an evaluation of 30 percent effective June 30, 2015, service connection for uncontrolled left leg movements, with balance impairment and stooped posture with an evaluation of 10 percent effective June 30, 2015, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, with an evaluation of 10 percent effective June 30, 2015, service connection for masked facies with an evaluation of 10 percent effective June 30, 2015, and service connection for loss of taste, with a noncompensable evaluation effective June 30, 2015.  

In May 2016, the AOJ received the Veteran's new VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim seeking increased ratings for Parkinson's symptoms.  In an August 2016 Rating Decision, the AOJ granted service connection for speech changes, with an evaluation of noncompensable effective October 1, 2015, service connection for stooped posture, with an evaluation of noncompensable effective October 1, 2015, denying a rating in excess of 10 percent for left leg bradykinesia with uncontrolled leg movements and tremors, with balance impairment and stooped posture, denying a rating in excess of 10 percent for right leg bradykinesia with uncontrolled leg movements, and proposing a decrease of the Veteran's 10 percent rating for masked facies to noncompensable.  In an October 2016 Rating Decision, the AOJ denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for Parkinson's disease with dementia and moderate sleep impairment, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for difficulty chewing and swallowing, and denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for masked facies, denied a compensable rating for loss of taste. 

After retaining the appellant, the Veteran, through the appellant, in September 2020, submitted a new VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim seeking increased ratings for loss of sense of smell, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, speech difficulties, loss of sense of taste, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and masked facies.   

In an October 2020 Rating Decision, the AOJ granted a 10 percent evaluation from September 10, 2020 for loss of sense of smell and a 10 percent evaluation from September 10, 2020 for speech changes.  In a November 2020 Rating Decision, the AOJ denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for dementia and moderate sleep impairment, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for difficulty chewing and swallowing, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity neuropathy, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for masked facies, denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for left and right upper extremity muscle rigidity with bradykinesia , denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and denied a compensable rating for loss of taste.

In September 2021, the Veteran, through the appellant as counsel, submitted VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Applications seeking increased ratings for speech difficulties, loss of taste, masked facies, dementia and moderate sleep impairment, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and difficulty chewing and swallowing.  In an October 2022 Rating Decision, the AOJ awarded a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder, dementia, and unspecified depressive disorder (PTSD) from February 10, 2022, a 20 percent rating for  left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, a 10 percent rating for loss of sense of taste from February 10, 2022, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, service connection for masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and service connection for speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side.  In the October 2022 Rating Decision, the AOJ also awarded a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture from February 10, 2022, and entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance criteria being met.  

While the October 2022 fee decision indicates the absence of a request for benefits that qualifies the appellant to receive fees, the October 2021 Supplemental Claim form claiming increased ratings for speech difficulties, loss of taste, masked facies, dementia and moderate sleep impairment, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and difficulty chewing and swallowing is indeed a qualifying request for benefits, as a result of which benefits were granted. Accordingly, the Board finds that attorney fees are warranted for these benefits in the amount specified in the September 2020 Fee Agreement.

In so ruling, the Board reiterates that in light of the Federal Circuit's decision in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Vet. Aff., 7 F.4 th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the Federal Circuit found invalid 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i)'s limitation of attorney fees in supplemental claims to only when the supplemental claim had been filed within one year of the prior rating decision. The Federal Circuit explained that a supplemental claim can be considered part of the same case as the initial rating decision, regardless of when the supplemental claim is filed. The Federal Circuit stated, "Just as a CUE claim belongs to the same 'case' as a [V]eteran's original claim for benefits, thereby permitting paid representation for work performed after an AOJ's initial decision, so too does a... supplemental claim seeking the 'same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis as the original claim." Id. at 65.

In this case, however, the appellant's October 2021 Supplemental Claim for increased ratings for speech difficulties, loss of taste, masked facies, dementia and moderate sleep impairment, left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and difficulty chewing and swallowing is part of the same case as the denials in adverse October 2020 and November 2020 Rating Decisions, and ultimately resulted in the October 2022 initial AMA decision awarding increased ratings for the same benefits-that is, a 100 percent rating for PTSD from February 10, 2022, a 20 percent rating for  left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, a 10 percent rating for loss of sense of taste from February 10, 2022, service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing, service connection for masked facies, seventh cranial nerve, left side, and service connection for speech changes, tenth cranial nerve, right side, there is no question that direct payment of the attorney fees specified in the Fee Agreement is warranted as to those benefits.

2. Eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the October 2022 grant of a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture from February 10, 2022, and entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance criteria being met (SMC aid and attendance).

Attorney fees are not warranted for the grant of a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture from February 10, 2022, and entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance criteria being met (SMC aid and attendance)

By way of procedural history, the AOJ granted service connection for stooped posture, assigning a noncompensable evaluation from October 1, 2015.   As outlined above, in September 2020, the parties signed and countersigned VA Form 21-22a, and the appellant timely filed a properly executed Fee Agreement.

The Veteran, through the appellant, submitted VA 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance, citing, inter alia, the Veteran's service-connected stooped posture as causing the need for aid and attendance. In its October 2022 Rating Decision, the AOJ granted a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture (previously rated as stooped posture) effective February 10, 2022, the date the AOJ received his VA 21-2680 form.  

Generally, under the AMA, a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review Claim or VA 10182 is considered an appeal of a claim to the Board. By contrast, a claim for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance as well as a claim on VA 21-526EZ is a new claim for benefits, and not an appeal of a prior decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i). In this case, while the Veteran had received ratings on account of a stooped posture, namely left and right uncontrolled leg movements, the 40 percent grant for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture is an initial decision after the Veteran's claim for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance. As the grant is not the result of a valid appeal under the AMA, direct payment of fees is not warranted for past-due benefits from its grant. Likewise, the Veteran's SMC for aid and attendance rating was granted in response to the VA Form 21-2680, and not a qualifying request for review. Accordingly, the October 2022 Rating Decision granting a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture and SMC is a decision on the Veteran's new claims for each benefit, and not issued pursuant to a qualifying request. Accordingly, attorney fees are not warranted for the October 2022 grant of a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture or SMC.

The VA Form 21-2680 filed in May 2022 is an initial claim. Despite the AOJ obtaining information relevant to a back rating, the application is not a qualifying AMA appeal of a prior decision. Applying 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1)(i), therefore, the "initial decision" is the October 2022 AOJ decision. The issuance of this initial decision triggered the beginning of the period for which the appellant may receive fees for work performed under the Fee Agreement. Id. But the decision itself does not warrant the direct payment of fees to the appellant for that particular grant.

As the evidence of record does not show that the October 2022 Rating Decision granting SMC for aid and attendance or a 40 percent rating for degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture was issued following a request for higher-level review, on or before one year after the date on which the AOJ issued a decision, a notice of disagreement, on or before one year after the date on which the AOJ issued a decision, or a supplemental claim, after a CAVC, Board, or AOJ decision, the October 2022 grant of those two benefits is the initial decision on the back and SMC for aid and attendance claims. Essentially, the appellant did not file a qualifying type of appellate review form that resulted in the award of past-due benefits related to those two claims. Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for eligibility to attorney fees are not met based on the past-due benefits for the 40 percent degenerative disc disease, arthritis, and stooped posture and SMC for aid and attendance rating awarded in the October 2022 Rating Decision, and the claim is denied. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (c)(1).  However, this does not preclude the appellant from collecting directly from the Veteran.
