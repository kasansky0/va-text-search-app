REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from August 1987 to August 1991.

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2023 rating decision.  In March 2024, the Veteran appealed the issues to the Board under the Hearing lane by submitting a VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), which allows for the submission of additional evidence for up to 90 days following the hearing.  See 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 177 (Jan. 18, 2019) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d)).  However, in June 2024, before a Hearing occurred, the Veteran withdrew his appeal.

The Board notes that the March 2023 rating decision awarded a 30 percent rating for IBS and a separate noncompensable (zero percent) rating for GERD.  In an April 2023 rating decision, however, the Regional Office (RO) determined that the award of two separate ratings was clear and unmistakable error (CUE), as the disabilities showed "the same manifestation under different diagnoses," and therefore resulted in impermissible pyramiding.  As such, the ratings for IBS and GERD were combined, and a single 30 percent rating was assigned under the predominant disability, IBS.  The Board has therefore characterized the issue as an appeal for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for IBS with GERD.

Withdrawal of Appeals

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Here, the Veteran's representative submitted a written notice on June 11, 2024, indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw his appeals to the Board regarding migraines, IBS, shortness of breath, allergic rhinitis, dermatitis of the right knee, hypertension, and stomach condition.

In light of this, the Veteran has clearly and explicitly withdrawn his appeals of these issues; hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issues on appeal, and they are dismissed.
