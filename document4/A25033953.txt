ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most persuasive evidence does not weigh against finding that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is etiologically related to his service-connected deviated septum.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With resolution of reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for a grant of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from July 1968 to June 1972, February 1975 to April 1978, and October 1980 to July 1996, including service in the Vietnam War.  

The rating decision that led to this appeal was issued in November 2019 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for sleep apnea, most recently addressed in the November 2019 rating decision.  In September 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2022 decision.  In a September 2023 decision, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In August 2024, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the December 6, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or attorney with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Obstructive Sleep Apnea

The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea is etiologically related to his active-duty service.  Specifically, he contends that his sleep apnea is due to his service-connected deviated septum.  He has also raised other theories of service connection, such as service connection on a direct basis but, because this theory is dispositive, the Board will not address the Veteran's other contentions.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995). 

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that an appellant will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in approximate balance with the negative evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).    

The Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea as a result of a polysomnogram in August 2016.

The Veteran has submitted an April 2019 medical opinion by his treating primary care physician at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, who opined that "[u]pper airway abnormalities including nasal septal deviation increase the likelihood of having or developing obstructive sleep apnea."

In July 2019 statements, the Veteran and his spouse report that he snored heavily and had restless sleep as early as 1990.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for sleep apnea in February 2021.  The clinician diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea but did not provide an opinion with regard to this theory of service connection.  

The Veteran was afforded an additional VA examination for sleep apnea in February 2022.  The clinician diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea and did not provide an opinion with regard to this theory of service connection but opined that it was not incurred in or caused by active duty service because sleep apnea was not mentioned in his service treatment records.  The clinician did not address the lay reports of symptoms having their onset in active duty service.  

The Veteran was afforded an additional VA medical opinion by a different clinician in April 2022.  The clinician opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea was not proximately due to or the result of service-connected disabilities including a deviated septum because the Veteran and his spouse reported symptom onset prior to the in-service injury that caused the deviated septum.  The opinion did not address the contradiction between this rationale and the February 2022 opinion with regard to direct service connection.  In addition, the clinician provided no opinion with regard to secondary aggravation.  To be adequate, a VA opinion must provide separate rationales for both causation and aggravation.  Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74 (2018).  For these reasons, this opinion is of limited probative value and will play no role in the Board's decision.

The Veteran was afforded additional VA medical opinions in October 2023 and July 2024, but they did not address this theory of service connection.  

The April 2019 Walter Reed medical opinion is favorable to the Veteran's claim and supported by an adequate rationale.  It contains no adequate medical opinion to the contrary.  In light of the totality of the circumstances, and after resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the evidence of record does not weigh persuasively against finding that the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by his service-connected deviated septum.  Accordingly, the Board finds that granting service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is the decision that is the most consistent with VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts of the case.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
