ORDER

Service connection for a lumbar spine condition is granted.

Service connection for a right hip condition is granted.

Service connection for a left shoulder condition is granted.

Service connection for a cervical spine condition is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current diagnoses of Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS), degenerative arthritis, and degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the lumbar spine are due to service. 

2. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current diagnoses of degenerative arthritis and labral tear of the right hip are due to service.

3. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tendinitis and degenerative arthritis of the left shoulder are due to service.

4. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's IVDS of the cervical spine is due to service.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine condition are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine condition are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1982 to June 1986. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in August 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

The Board notes that the Veteran had additional service from June 1986 to February 1989; however, this period of service was found to be dishonorable for VA benefits purposes. See 11/4/1992 VA Memo. 

In the July 25, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of August 18, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after August 18, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The August 18, 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims of a lumbar spine condition, cervical spine condition, right hip condition, and left shoulder condition. See 8/18/2023 Rating Decision. These are favorable findings by the RO and the Board will proceed to address the claim on the merits. See 38?U.S.C. § 5104A; 38?C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable to his senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine condition.

The Veteran asserts that his lumbar spine condition was onset during service as a result of lifting and pulling heavy items while working on airplanes, as well as physical training. 6/9/2023 C&P Exam, p. 2; 12/19/2020 VA Form 21-4138. After review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is warranted. 

The RO's August 2023 rating decision included the favorable finding that the Veteran has current diagnoses of degenerative arthritis, DDD, and IVDS. 8/18/2023 Rating Decision, p. 6. In addition, the RO's favorable findings indicate that the evidence shows a qualifying event, injury, or disease that had its onset in service and that a medical nexus exists. Id. However, the RO separately concluded that that the Veteran's condition neither occurred in nor was caused by service. Id. at 5. Despite this discrepancy, for the reasons discussed below, the Board finds no reason to disturb the RO's favorable findings because the Veteran is entitled to service connection for his left shoulder disability. See 38 C.F.R. 3.104.

With respect to the issues of an in-service event and medical nexus linking the Veteran's condition to his military service, the Veteran has stated that his back injury has continued in varying degrees since the time that he separated from active duty. 5/26/2023 VA Form 21-4138, p. 1. The Board notes the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was tactical aircraft maintenance specialist. See 2/21/1989 DD-214. Although the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable to his senses, he is not competent to report establish a causal link between his condition and his military service, as that requires medical expertise that the Veteran has not been shown to have. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a). Therefore, the Board finds the Veteran's statements as to his ongoing symptomatology to be competent and credible, and assigns his statements moderate probative weight.

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion in May 2023. See 5/26/2023 Med. Treatment. Rec. The private opinion concluded that, based upon a review of the record, the Veteran's statements regarding the original onset of symptoms during service, the symptoms' continuous and progressive nature, and the relevant medical literature, it is more likely than not that the Veteran's current lumbar condition is due to the overuse injury he sustained during active military service. Id. at 3. The Board notes that the examiner did not specifically address the presence of any medical records evidencing complaints of or treatment for the Veteran's condition while in service or in the years following. However, the Board acknowledges that the absence of documentation does not render the Veteran's lay statements uncredible. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that the lack of contemporaneous medical records does not serve as an "absolute bar" to the service connection claim). The Board, therefore, finds that the examiner is competent and credible and that the opinion carries substantial probative weight. 

The Board notes that the May 2023 private medical opinion is the only medical opinion of record. Although the Veteran did undergo a VA examination for his thoracolumbar spine, there was no medical opinion provided by the examiner because the RO did not request one. See 6/1/2023 Exam Request.

Additionally, the Board notes that arthritis is a presumptively chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. 3.303. The Veteran reports that he injured his back in service as the result of physical training and heavy lifting/pulling in relation to his airplane responsibilities and that he has experienced his symptoms consistently since the time of his discharge from active duty. The Veteran's claims regarding his injuries are corroborated by his military occupational specialty (MOS) of tactical aircraft maintenance specialist. See 2/21/1989 DD-214. Because the Board otherwise has no reason to doubt the credibility or veracity of the Veteran, the Board assigns his statements substantial probative weight. 

After review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's lumbar spine condition is the result of his military service. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is for application and all doubt has been resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a); see Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014) (noting that the benefit of the doubt rule is a unique standard of proof, and "the nation, 'in recognition of our debt to our veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding such benefits"). Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a lumbar spine condition, diagnosed as degenerative arthritis, DDD, and IVDS, is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip condition.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right hip condition he asserts is related to physical training exercises during his active-duty military service. See 5/26/2023 Va Form 21-4138. 

The RO's August 2023 rating decision including a favorable finding that the Veteran has current diagnoses of degenerative arthritis and right hip strain. 8/18/2023 Rating, p. 7. The Board further notes a diagnosis of right hip labral tear from a June 2023 VA examination. 6/9/2023 C&P Exam, p. 3. In addition, the RO found that the Veteran's disabilities are medically related to his military service. 8/18/2023 Rating Decision, p. 7. Because the Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in these favorable findings, the Board sees no reason to disturb them and finds that the first and third elements of service connection have been established. See 38 C.F.R. 3.104.

As to the second element of service connection, evidence of an in-service disease, injury, or event, the Veteran has provided various statements regarding the initial onset of his symptoms. The Veteran has stated that his injuries began after injuring his hip during physical training exercises and that his pain has continued ever since active duty. 5/26/2023 VA Form 21-4138, p. 1. The Board notes that the Veteran's June 2023 C&P Exam indicates an onset date of approximately 2008. However, it is unclear whether that onset date is a reference to the Veteran's arthritis symptoms or right hip labral tear. Resolving favor in doubt of the Veteran, the Board finds that the onset of the Veteran's arthritis-related injuries leading to the development of his arthritis-related symptoms was during service, as supported by his credible lay statements. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. Therefore, the Board, in resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, finds that the Veteran's symptoms were onset during service and that the second element of service connection has been established.

Moreover, the Board notes that arthritis is a presumptively chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. 3.303. Therefore, based on the Veteran's lay statements that his symptoms were onset in service and have continued ever since active duty, the Board finds that service connection for degenerative arthritis is also warranted on a presumptive basis as a chronic disease related to his continuity of symptomatology since the original onset of the injury. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record is, at a minimum, in approximate balance and that, therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Accordingly, the Board has resolved all doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that service connection for a right hip condition is warranted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition.

The Veteran contends he suffered a left shoulder injury after a motorcycle accident during active service in 1984. 6/19/2023 C&P Exam, p. 2. 

The RO's August 2023 rating decision included the favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left shoulder strain and that a nexus between his condition and his military service has been established by the record. 8/18/2023 Rating Decision, p. 5. Therefore, because the Board finds no reason to disturb these findings, the first and third elements of service connection have been established. 

As to the second element of service connection, that of an in-service event, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) indicate that the Veteran sought treatment for his right shoulder and face after a motorcycle accident in June 1986. 1/9/2023 STR - Medical, p. 37. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's STR references a right shoulder injury and that the Veteran is currently claiming service connection for a left shoulder injury. However, the Veteran's credible lay statements indicate that his left shoulder was also injured during this event. 6/19/2023 C&P Exam, p. 3. Because the Board finds that the in-service event in question occurred, the Board shall resolve any doubt in favor of the Veteran with respect to the discrepancy. 

Therefore, after review of the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability was related to the in-service motorcycle accident and that, per the Veteran's reports, he has experienced continuous symptoms since the time of the original onset during service and the Veteran's private medical opinion establishes a medical nexus between the Veteran's current chronic disability (arthritis)and the in-service event. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a). Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability is granted. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a cervical spine condition that he sustained as the result of multiple in-service incidents, including a motorcycle accident and falling off of a ladder while working on an airplane. 6/19/2023 C&P Exam, p. 2; 5/26/2023 VA Form 21-4138, p. 1. 

The RO's August 2023 rating decision included favorable findings that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of cervical spine strain and his June 2023 VA examination made a diagnosis of IVDS. 8/18/2023 Rating Decision, p. 3; 6/19/2023 C&P Exam, p. 2. Therefore, the Board finds that the first element of service connection has been established. In addition, the RO made a favorable finding that the Veteran's May 25, 2023 private medical opinion established a nexus between his disability and his military service. 8/18/2023 Rating Decision, p. 3. Because the Board sees no reason to disturb this finding, the Board finds that the third element of service connection has also been established. 

As to the second element, that of an in-service event, injury, or disease, the Veteran contends that his neck pain onset after falling from a ladder while working on an airplane and after his in-service motorcycle accident. 6/19/2023 C&P Exam, p. 2. The Board notes the Veteran's June 1986 STR indicating treatment for injuries to his face and shoulder after a motorcycle accident. 1/9/2023 STR - Medical, p. 37. Although this STR does not specifically reference an injury to the Veteran's neck, the Board notes the Veteran's injury to his face and the use of sutures for a laceration sustained to the chin. Id. With respect to the Veteran's contention that he was sustained an injury to his neck when he fell off a ladder while working on an airplane, the Board was not able to corroborate this contention through review of STRs. However, the Board notes the Veteran's MOS was tactical aircraft maintenance specialist so such tends to be consistent with his in-service duties. See 2/21/1989 DD-214. The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that his neck symptoms began at the onset of these in-service events and have continued consistently from their onset to the present time. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a).

The Board finds that the competent and probative evidence of record is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's neck condition is due to an in-service event. Therefore, in resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a cervical spine condition is granted.
