FINDING OF FACT

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1969 to February 1972.

As discussed in more detail below, in November 2024, the Veteran submitted a copy of an April 2024 VA Form 10182 appealing an April 2023 rating decision denying effective dates earlier than January 4, 2023, for the grants of service connection for left and right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

See discussion at section 2 below.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy

In a March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy with an effective date of March 9, 2023.  In April 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review of the effective date assigned.  

In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted an earlier effective date of January 4, 2023, but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for bilateral lower extremity diabetic neuropathy.

On April 18, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the effective date assigned for the grant of service connection for bilateral lower extremity diabetic neuropathy.  The form was dated on April 10, 2024.  Although he identified the March 2023 rating decision on the form, his notice of disagreement was later accepted as timely to appeal the April 2023 rating decision.  This appeal was docketed under docket number 240418-456157.  In an October 2024 decision, the Board denied entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for left and right lower extremity diabetic neuropathy.  

On May 29, 2024, while docket number 240418-456157 was pending, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 10182 seeking earlier effective dates.  This appeal was assigned docket number 240529-443314.  In a later October 2024 decision, the Board dismissed the Veteran's appeal for earlier effective dates.  In this regard, the Board found that the May 2024 VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election because it identified the exact same issues as his earlier, April 2024 VA Form 10182.  The Board also stressed that "because this exact claim on appeal has been fully adjudicated from Docket No. 240418-456157, the Veteran is not prejudiced in dismissing this second identical claim."

In November 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, which identified the date of decision as March 11, 2023, and was dated on April 10, 2024, seeking earlier effective dates for the grant of service connection for bilateral lower extremity diabetic neuropathy.  The Board finds that this is a duplicate or exact copy of his earlier April 2024 VA Form 10182, discussed above, because it is dated on the same day and identifies the same rating decision.  This appeal was assigned the instant docket number 241109-503507.

Additionally, the Board construed the November 2024 VA Form 10182 as a motion for reconsideration of the Board's October 2024 decision denying earlier effective dates.  The Board denied the motion in February 2025.  

Unfortunately, the Board finds that the instant appeal was docketed in error.  The submission of two copies of the same form appealing the same issue resulted in the same appeal being docketed at the Board under two different docket numbers (docket number 240418-456157 and docket number 241109-503507).  This is an administrative error as the VA Form 10182 associated with the claims file on November 9, 2024, is a copy of the VA Form 10182 received on April 18, 2024.

Moreover, as noted above, the Board denied the same issues in an October 2024 decision.  Further, the Board dismissed the same issues in a separate October 2024 decision.

Applicable law provides that when a claim is disallowed by the Board, generally the decision may not thereafter be readjudicated, and a claim based upon the same factual basis may not be considered.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.  After a Board decision is final, an appellant may file an appeal to the Court, if desired, or may file a motion for reconsideration, a motion to vacate for denial of due process, or a motion for revision based on CUE.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

Here, the Veteran's claim for earlier effective dates was fully adjudicated in the October 2024 Board decision under docket number 240418-456157 and dismissed in the October 2024 Board decision under docket number 240529-443314.  As noted above, the Board denied a motion for reconsideration of this decision in February 2025.  Comparing the issues on appeal in docket number 240418-456157 and docket number 240529-443314, with the instant appeal, the Board already considered the same disability, filings, and period on appeal as in the present appeal, because the Veteran limited his appeal to the same singular issue and because the instant VA Form 10182 is a copy of his earlier form.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182 (appealing "[e]ntitlement to an earlier effective date for Diabetic Neuropathy"); May 2024 VA Form 10182 (appealing "[e]ntitlement to EED for Diabetic Neuropathy"); November 2024 VA Form 10182 (appealing "[e]ntitlement to an earlier effective date for Diabetic Neuropathy").  As already adjudicated, the Veteran abandoned an appeal for service connection on December 22, 2015, and only reopened the claim on January 4, 2023.

In sum, the Board finds that this appeal was docketed in error in that the Veteran merely submitted a copy of a previous VA Form 10182, which was adjudicated in full.  Given that the current appeal is a duplicate appeal of the same issue, the Board similarly finds that no case or controversy exists for the Board to decide at this time.  Moreover, because this exact claim on appeal was fully adjudicated in Docket No. 240418-456157, the Veteran is not prejudiced in dismissing this identical claim.  Under these circumstances, the Board concludes that the current appeal was docketed in error and therefore must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.
