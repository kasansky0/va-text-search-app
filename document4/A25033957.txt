ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lower back pain is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for mental health/stress, anxiety and depression is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claims for lower back pain and mental health/stress were denied in an April 2023 rating decision.

2. The Veteran filed a new claim for "back strain," as well as anxiety and depression, in November 2023. The claim for back strain was denied in a March 2024 rating decision. The claims for anxiety and depression were combined and granted in an April 2024 rating decision. 

3. In April 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with the April 2023 rating decision and the March 2024 rating decision. In that notice of disagreement, the Veteran expressly distinguished the back strain claim from the lower back pain claim-that is, the Veteran listed the two disabilities as separate issues in the notice of disagreement, and correctly identified the back strain claim as being associated with the March 2024 rating decision, and the lower back pain claim as being associated with the April 2023 rating decision.

4. In May 2024, the Veteran filed a second notice of disagreement for the April 2023 rating decision, appealing the denial of service connection for both lower back pain and mental health/stress, anxiety and depression. That is the notice of disagreement giving rise to the appeal currently before the Board.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for lower back pain have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for mental health have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 2019 to December 2022. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision of the Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA), which is also the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for lower back pain is dismissed.

When a claim is denied, the claimant has a variety of review options available, including appealing to the Board via a VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement. To appeal a decision, the VA Form 10182 must be received within one year from the date the AOJ sent the claimant notice of the decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

As to the Veteran's lower back pain claim, the AOJ mailed the rating decision on April 6, 2023, which started the clock on the time to appeal. The Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182 or seek any other review option until May 4, 2024, which was after the one-year deadline.

 

While the one-year deadline is not a jurisdictional bar to the Board's review of a claim, "it is an important and mandatory claim-processing rule." See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc). 

In this case, the Veteran failed to adhere to the filing deadline, and he has offered no explanation as to why the VA should waive this requirement. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). See also, Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (while the Board has jurisdiction to hear an appeal that is not in conformity with the relevant claims processing rules, it may dismiss nonconforming filings in appropriate circumstances if it explains its reasons for doing so).

The Board finds there was no timely appeal of the lower back pain issue, and there is no evidence of good cause for extending the deadline for appealing it. This appeal is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for mental health/stress, anxiety and depression is dismissed.

As to this disability, the timeline is somewhat muddled because in November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) for anxiety and depression.  The Board finds this supplemental claim filed was an alternative to a VA 10182 to obtain review of the denial of the mental health/stress, anxiety and depression claim, albeit under a slightly different name. The AOJ recharacterized the disability as adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression granted service connection. See April 2024 rating decision. 

Therefore, no allegation of error in law or fact is left to be resolved by the Board here, and the appeal before the Board is moot. Barrera v. Gober, 122 F.3d 1030 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Grantham v. Brown, 114 F. 3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

The Board observes the Veteran has not appealed the effective date or the disability rating assigned to his adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression, but even if he had, those would be downstream issues. This appeal is dismissed.
