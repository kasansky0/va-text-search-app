FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, prior to filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), both of which sought review of all issues on appeal. 

2. The Veteran reiterated his desire to file a request for Higher-Level Review when he resubmitted the same VA Form 20-0996, as well as when he contacted VA in order to schedule an informal conference, an option which is provided to Veterans on this form.

3. The Veteran did not withdraw his request for Higher-Level Review, nor did the agency of original jurisdiction reject the Veteran's request for Higher-Level Review.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from February 1993 to February 1996.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision addressing TDIU and a June 2024 rating decision addressing increased ratings for right knee strain and instability, as well as increased ratings for all ten fingers.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board notes that while the Veteran also appealed an April 2024 rating decision addressing TDIU, because the Veteran's claim for TDIU was part and parcel of his claim for service connection for right knee conditions, the Board finds that the issue of TDIU was also raised by the record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision that granted service connection for right knee instability and right knee strain. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). As such, any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain with limitation of flexion is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the left little finger is dismissed.

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the left ring finger is dismissed.

5. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the right ring finger is dismissed.

6. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the right little finger is dismissed.

7. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the left thumb is dismissed.

8. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the right thumb is dismissed.

9. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the left long finger is dismissed.

10. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the left index finger is dismissed.

11. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the right index finger is dismissed.

12. Entitlement to a compensable rating for Dupuytren's contracture of the right long finger is dismissed.

13. Entitlement to total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

As a matter of background, the AOJ denied the above issues in a June 20, 2024, rating decision. On the same day the rating decision was issued, the Veteran filed both a VA Form 20-0996 seeking higher-level review, as well as a VA Form 10182, seeking an appeal to the Board. The electronic claims file shows that the VA Form 20-0996 was received first. On June 21, 2024, the Veteran resubmitted his VA Form 20-0996, again seeking a higher-level review of the above issues. On June 25, 2024, the Veteran returned a call from VA and provided his scheduling availability for an informal conference related to his request for higher-level review. The AOJ then issued a rating decision on July 1, 2024, in response to the request for higher-level review, in which it again denied all issues on appeal except for the issue of entitlement to TDIU, which was not addressed.

On July 5, 2024, the Board sent the Veteran a docketing letter, informing him that his appeal dated June 20, 2024, had been placed on the direct review docket. However, this letter also noted that, although the appeal had been docketed at that time, it was possible that further review would reveal that the appeal request did not meet the necessary procedural requirements, and the appeal may ultimately be dismissed based on said procedural defect.

The procedural history in this case indicates that the Veteran's June 2024 submission of a VA Form 10182 was an attempt at a concurrent election of a second appeal. While the VA Form 20-0996 and the VA Form 10182 were both submitted on the same day, the VA Form 20-0996 was submitted first. Additionally, the Veteran resubmitted the VA Form 20-0996 the next day, which supports the conclusion that the Veteran wished to file the VA Form 20-0996 and proceed with his request for a higher-level review. This is further supported by the Veteran's scheduling of an informal conference with the AOJ, an option which is available when seeking a higher-level review but is not available when seeking a Board appeal.

Thus, it appears that the Veteran attempted to initiate an appeal to the Board while a higher-level review appeal was still pending. Indeed, the submission of the VA Form 10182 came before the Veteran was notified of the July 2024 rating decision addressing all of the increased ratings claims, and the Veteran indicated that his appeal was of the June 2024 rating decision. Additionally, the claim for TDIU, which was not addressed in the July 2024 rating decision, was still pending with the AOJ. Since the Veteran did not explicitly withdraw his higher-level review appeal, this type of concurrent election is prohibited. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), (e)(1). As such, all issues in this appeal must be dismissed.

As an additional matter, the Board notes that the AOJ later granted increased ratings with respect to the Veteran's bilateral thumbs, index fingers, and long fingers. The Board further notes that the Veteran has continued to pursue the issue of entitlement to TDIU. While the Board has dismissed these issues with respect to the June 2024 rating decision, matters that occurred after that rating decision are not before the Board, have not been addressed by the Board, and are not affected by this decision.
