ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to traumatic noise exposure in service. 

2. The Veteran does not have left knee disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for left knee disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 2014 to June 2018.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2024 and August 2023 and constitutes initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of either the July 2024 or August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board lastly notes that the Veteran has one year from the date of the July 2024 rating decision concerning tinnitus to request a change in the appeal lane.  However, given that the Board is granting that claim in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication prior to expiration of that one-year period.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Continuity of symptomatology may also provide a basis for a grant of service connection for diseases, such as tinnitus and bilateral hearing loss, defined as "chronic" by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). After careful consideration of the evidence, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence, which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the appellant. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the appellant prevailing in either event, or whether a preponderance of the evidence is against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that the ringing in his ears began in service and continued. 

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d. 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Because tinnitus is largely "subjective," its existence is generally determined by whether or not the veteran claims to experience it. For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

Service treatment records (STRs), including his entrance and separation examination, are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for tinnitus or related symptoms. The Veteran was fit for earplugs in December 2016 and denied ringing in the ears. 

During a July 2024 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of tinnitus. The Veteran reported an onset of tinnitus in 2018 following weapon noise exposure. He described his tinnitus as a constant humming noise in both ears. The examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not due to his military service. The examiner stated that there was no nexus of auditory damage on active duty. 

The July 2024 rating decision made the following favorable findings: the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus, and his military occupational specialty (MOS) indicates a probability of noise exposure. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. Therefore, the only issue remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's tinnitus was etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure. 

After carefully reviewing and weighing the competent evidence of record, the Board is satisfied that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). Thus, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

The unfavorable evidence in this case consists of the lack of treatment records for tinnitus and the July 2024 examiner's negative direct service opinion. However, the record contains favorable evidence in the form of the Veteran's credible and competent reports of ringing in the ears following weapon noise exposure in 2018. The Veteran reported a constant humming sound in both ears that does not go away. Given the nature of tinnitus, the Veteran is uniquely situated to competently identify and report on its onset and duration. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Here, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports of onset and continuity of symptoms of tinnitus both competent and credible, and thus is positive evidence that supports a finding of nexus in this case.

For these reasons, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and grants service connection for tinnitus. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability

The Veteran contends that his left knee disability was caused by extensive physical training for infantry. In the alternate, the Veteran contends that his left knee disability was caused or aggravated by his service-connected right knee disability. 

Service treatment records (STRs), including his entrance and separation examination, are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for a left knee disability. 

Post-service VA treatment records were silent for any complaints, treatment, or a diagnosis for a right knee disability. 

During an April 2018 separation VA examination, the examiner did not diagnose a left knee disorder. 

Initially, the Board notes that in order to be successful on a claim for service connection, either direct or secondary, the Veteran must have a current disability. Here, the record is devoid of any documented diagnosis of a left knee disability, and the Veteran's service treatment records and post-service treatment records were silent for a left knee disorder. Nor do the medical records on file document impairment of left knee functioning.  Therefore, the Bord finds that service connection is not warranted on either a direct or secondary basis for left knee disability. 

As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report symptoms pertaining to a left knee disability, such as pain. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). The Board finds the Veteran's account lacks credibility as it not corroborated by the record. See Macarubbo v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 388 (1997) (holding that the credibility of lay evidence can be affected and even impeached by inconsistent statements, internal inconsistency of statements, inconsistency with other evidence of record, facial implausibility, bad character, interest, bias, self-interest, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and witness demeanor). Service treatment records and post-service medical records fail to demonstrate any complaints of pain or treatment for a left knee disability. In fact, with the exception of this claim, the record is silent for mention of the left knee. See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59 (1994) (a Veteran's version of events from the past may be of limited credibility and probative value in the absence of medical records showing treatment for the claimed disorder).

Under McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006), a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i). The third prong, which requires evidence that the claimed disability or symptoms "may be" associated with the established event, is a low threshold. McClendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.

Here, the Veteran's lay statements of left knee pain are contradicted by the competent and credible medical evidence of the record. Thus, the record does not suggest nor indicate a current disability nor persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability. The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran does not contend his symptoms continued since service and does not allege an in-service event. The record does not support an in-service event, injury, or disease occurred in service causing a left knee disability. Therefore, as the record does not indicate the Veteran's claimed symptoms may be associated with an established event, the Board finds the VA's duty to assist was not triggered. Thus, a VA examination in not necessary. 

After considering the evidence of the record, including lay statements from the Veteran, the Board finds that Veteran does not have a diagnosis associated with his left knee at any point during the appeal period. Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection on either a direct or secondary basis for a left knee disability is denied.
