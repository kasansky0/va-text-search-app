FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a left knee disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The Veteran's right knee disability is manifest by an extension endpoint to 10 degrees.

3. The Veteran's rhinitis has not resulted in polyps, greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, or complete obstruction on one side.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(16), 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.03.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1984 to June 2007. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions. In April 2024, the RO issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2023 and January 2024 decisions. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision for the knee claims, and the January 2024 rating decision for the rhinitis claim.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this Decision, there is no requirement that every piece of evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail. Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim. See Gonzales v. West,?218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81?(Fed. Cir. 2000); Timberlake v. Gober,?14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130?(2000).

Service Connection - Left Knee

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is warranted because the claimed disability is the result of active service. More specifically, the Veteran asserts that the left knee disability was caused by physical training in-service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for direct service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claims or is in approximate balance, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claims, in which case the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Analysis - Left Knee Disability

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a left knee disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran filed a claim for left knee benefits in August 2023. At that time, the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination. 

In the September 2023 Knee and Lower Leg Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), the examiner indicated that the only diagnosable conditions on examination included a right knee strain and right knee degenerative arthritis; there was no indication of a left knee disability diagnosis. 

There is no other medical evidence of record that indicates a diagnosable left knee disability or left knee pain that reaches a level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.

The Board does not doubt the sincerity of the Veteran's belief that there is a current diagnosis of a left knee disability, but, in the Board's view, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires an understanding of body systems and interpretation of diagnostic testing and criteria.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 & n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

II

Increased Rating - Right Knee

The Veteran asserts a rating in excess of 10 percent for the right knee disability is warranted because his symptoms are worse than contemplated by the currently assigned rating. 

The Veteran's right knee disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, for limitation of extension of the leg. Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted for extension limited to 5 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 10 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 15 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 20 degrees. A 40 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 30 degrees. A 50 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). 

Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Analysis - Right Knee

In a September 2023 Knee and Lower Leg DBQ, the examiner noted a diagnoses of right knee degenerative arthritis and right knee strain. The Veteran reported that pain and soreness in the right knee worsened with prolonged sitting and standing. Flare-ups were noted as occurring once every two weeks lasting for hours in duration and characteristic of sharp pain at the joints; symptoms were described as moderate in severity. Range of motion testing revealed a flexion endpoint to 115 degrees and an extension endpoint to 5 degrees; the Veteran exhibited pain in flexion and extension. Range of motion did not change during passive range of motion testing for the right knee. The right knee also exhibited evidence of pain with active motion and passive motion causing functional loss. There was objective evidence of crepitus on examination and localized tenderness or pain on palpation in the patella that was moderate in severity. The Veteran did not experience additional loss of function or range of motion following repetitive-use testing. 

In the September 2023 DBQ, the examiner provided an estimated range of motion following repeated use over time, which was noted as a flexion endpoint to 105 degrees and an extension endpoint to 10 degrees; pain, fatigability, and weakness contributed to functional loss. The estimated range of motion during a flare-up was noted as a flexion endpoint to 95 degrees and an extension endpoint to 10 degrees. Additional factors contributing to the right knee disability included interference with sitting, interference with standing, disturbance of locomotion, and less movement than normal. No muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or joint instability on examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, repetitive use, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he experiences flare-ups once every two weeks lasting hours in duration would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating extension limited to 15 degrees. While the Veteran experiences pain with prolonged sitting, standing, and walking, the Veteran's reports of functional loss during flare-ups, repeated use over time, and repetitive-use testing did not approximate extension limited to 15 degrees

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

Regarding DC 5256, there was no ankylosis. Regarding DCs 5257-59, there was no knee instability and no dislocation or removal of semilunar cartilage. The Board is persuaded by the totality of the evidence of record that the Veteran did not have a compensable knee extension disability during the period on appeal. Regarding DC 5262, there was no tibia or fibula impairment. Regarding DC 5263, there was no genu recurvatum.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

III

Increased Rating - Chronic Allergic Rhinitis

The Veteran's rhinitis has been rated as noncompensable under DC 6522 for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis for the entire period on appeal, beginning in September 2023, when he filed a claim for increase. Under DC 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.

This rating code does not contain provisions for a zero percent evaluation. In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a DC, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

In a January 2024 Sinus/Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx DBQ the examiner noted the Veteran's allergic rhinitis diagnosis. Onset symptoms included nasal congestion, sinus pressure, cough, runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and nasal polyps. The Veteran's treatment for allergic rhinitis, at that time, included Benadryl. At the time of the examination the Veteran reported treating symptoms with Zyrtec, Flonase, and Singulair. The Veteran reported intermittent headaches, that sinus congestion interferes with concentration and causes difficulty breathing at times. The examiner found that there was no evidence of greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, no complete obstruction of either nasal passage, and no nasal polyps. Permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates was noted. There was no loss of part of the nose, scars, granulomatous conditions, or larynx or pharynx conditions.

The question in this appeal is whether the Veteran's rhinitis resulted in polyps, greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, or complete obstruction on one side. 

After careful review of the evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 6522 have not been met. The Veteran's symptoms have included nasal congestion, sinus pressure, cough, runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and nasal polyps. According to the January 2024 DBQ, the Veteran did not have nasal passage obstruction greater than 50 percent on both sides, complete obstruction of either side, polyps, or granulomatous conditions. The Veteran also did not have any larynx or pharynx conditions.

The Board finds the objective medical evidence to be competent, probative, and credible in determining that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a compensable disability rating. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77. In addition to the medical evidence above, the Board has considered the lay evidence in the form of the Veteran's correspondence. A layperson is competent to testify regarding the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer, 7 Vet. App. 379, 384 ; Falzone, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 ; Caldwell, 1 Vet. App. 466. However, even affording the Veteran full competence and credibility, the statements do not show impairment more closely approximating the criteria for a higher rating.
