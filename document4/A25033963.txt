ORDER

The claim for entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is dismissed.

The claim for restoration of a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis to include residuals of a broken nose, effective July 22, 2023, is dismissed.

Entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for sinusitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On December 28, 2023, the Veteran filed a request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) (VA Form 20-0996) and an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) (VA Form 10182), as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for CFS and restoration of a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis to include residuals of a broken nose, effective July 22, 2023.

2. On May 3, 2024, and May 8, 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) responded to the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996 submission by issuing notices of HLR rating decisions for the CFS and allergic rhinitis issues respectively.

3. The Veteran does not have sinusitis as the result of carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment or similar instance of fault as a result of VA treatment, nor is sinusitis the result of an event not reasonably foreseeable.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for CFS have been met. 38 C.F.R. § 20.2500.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim for restoration of a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis to include residuals of a broken nose, effective July 22, 2023, have been met. § 20.2500.

3. The criteria for compensation for sinusitis under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1151 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.361.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2015 to April 2019.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in February 2023 and August 2023 and constitute an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 (38 U.S.C. § 1151 claim) and August 2023 (CFS and allergic rhinitis claims) AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dismissed Claims

VA regulation provides that claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing an HLR request, Supplemental Claim, or Board Appeal. 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(a). VA regulation prohibits the concurrent election of review of a VA decision under different review options and indicates that a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(a) may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option. 38 C.F.R. 3.2500(b). 

A claimant may withdraw a Supplemental Claim or HLR request at any time before VA issues a decision on the issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(d). If a claimant wants to change the review option while an issue is pending adjudication, and it is within one year of the prior decision notice, the claimant may do so by withdrawing the request as prescribed in 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(d) and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue. 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(e); 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 3 (2023).

An August 2023 rating decision denied service connection for CFS. The August 2023 rating decision also reduced the rating for allergic rhinitis to include residuals of a broken nose from 10 percent to 0 percent, effective July 22, 2023. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, HLR Request for the allergic rhinitis issue in August 2023. A December 2023 HLR rating decision continued the noncompensable rating for allergic rhinitis.

On December 28, 2023, the Veteran contemporaneously filed two review option requests for his CFS and allergic rhinitis claims: (1) VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) and (2) VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). As a result, a concurrent election was created that is prohibited under the AMA. The Veteran proceeded with the higher-level review option for both issues and the issues were improperly docketed at the Board.

The Veteran's HLR requests were adjudicated in subsequent April 2024 and May 2024 rating decisions. In the April 2024 rating decision, for which notification was provided in May 2024, service connection for CFS continued to be denied. The May 2024 rating decision increased the rating for t allergic rhinitis and residuals of a broken nose to 10 percent, effective December 28, 2023. Notably, the Veteran has continued to pursue the issue of service connection for CFS by filing a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim in May 2024. This will be addressed separately by the AOJ.

Although the Board cannot dismiss the appeal for these issues due to lack of jurisdiction, the Board may dismiss the appeal for a procedural defect. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction but may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect, where the Board improperly docketed in the modernized appeal system an appeal with concurrent administrative review options pending).

Therefore, the Board finds that the appeal for these issues must be dismissed due to an improper concurrent election. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Compensation Under 38 USC 1151 for Sinusitis

The law provides that compensation may be paid for a qualifying additional disability that is (1) not the result of the Veteran's willful misconduct; (2) was caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished the Veteran under any law administered by VA either by a VA employee or in a VA facility; and (3) the proximate cause of the disability was (A) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination or (B) an event not reasonably foreseeable. See 38 U.S.C. § 1151.

In the October 2022 application for benefits, the Veteran claimed (in relevant part) compensation for sinusitis under 38 U.S.C. § 1151. He reported that after "surgeries by the VA" he started to have sinusitis. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Historically, the Veteran sustained a broken nose while participating in martial arts in service. Service treatment records also show he was treated for acute sinusitis (without X-ray evidence) in October 2017. A December 2018 separation examination shows the Veteran had no current sinus complaints. The examiner noted the Veteran's history of sinusitis and broken nose, but sated no sinusitis was found on examination.

Following service, a January 2019 rating decision awarded service connection for allergic rhinitis to include residuals of broken nose.

VA treatment records show the Veteran was treated for sinusitis for 10 days in May 2019; in June 2019, he reported feeling better. 

He underwent a septorhinoplasty for acquired nasal deformity in June 2019. His history of nasal fracture in service with severely deviated septum affecting his breathing was noted. Informed consent was obtained; there were no complications during surgery. 

A July 2019 follow up report notes the Veteran was doing well. He was using sprays and reported some difficulty breathing from the nose. The splint was removed. He was seen again two weeks later with complaints of congestion and pain. He had not been blowing his nose or irrigating. Examination showed congestion with purulent rhinorrhea. Stents were removed and the nose was suctioned. In September 2019, he was seen with complaints of daily episodes of blood-tinged mucous when blowing his nose hard. He reported worsening congestion over the last two weeks. Assessment included mild chronic rhinitis. Subsequent treatment records show the Veteran's ongoing treatment for rhinitis.

An October 2020 VA examination report and November 2022 X-ray studies are negative for findings of sinusitis.

For compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, there first must be evidence of additional disability, as shown by comparing the veteran's condition before and after the VA medical care in question. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b). To determine whether a veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the Veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy (CWT) program upon which the claim is based to the Veteran's condition after such care, treatment, examination, services, or program has stopped. VA considers each body part or system separately. The additional disability must not be the result of the Veteran's willful misconduct. See 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(c)(3).

Second, the additional disability must be caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy program furnished the veteran by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c). Merely showing that a veteran received care, treatment, or examination and that the veteran has an additional disability does not establish cause. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1). In order for an additional disability to be compensable under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, the additional disability must have been actually caused by, and not merely coincidental to, hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or medical examination furnished by a VA employee or in a VA facility. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1); Loving v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 96, 99-100 (2005); Sweitzer v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 503, 505 (1993). That is, the additional disability must have been the result of injury that was part of the natural sequence of cause and effect flowing directly from the actual provision of "hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination" furnished by VA and such additional disability must be directly caused by that VA activity. Loving, 19 Vet. App. at 101.

Third, the proximate cause of the disability, as opposed to a remote contributing cause, must be (1) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination; or (2) an event that was not reasonably foreseeable. See 38 U.S.C. § 1151(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d). Whether the proximate cause of the additional disability was an event not reasonably foreseeable is to be determined based on what a reasonable health care provider would have foreseen. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(2). The event need not be completely unforeseeable or unimaginable but must be one that a reasonable health care provider would not have considered to be an ordinary risk of the treatment provided. In determining whether an event was reasonably foreseeable, VA will consider whether the risk of that event was the type of risk that a reasonable health care provider would have disclosed in connection with informed consent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(2).

The mere fact that the Veteran received care, treatment, or examination and has an additional disability does not establish actual causation. Evidence must show that VA hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination resulted in additional disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1).

In this case, a VA examiner reviewed the claims file, examined the Veteran, and provided a medical opinion in November 2022. The examiner noted that the Veteran had sinusitis and septal deviation prior to the 2019 surgery. Regarding the Veteran's claim that his sinusitis worsened after surgery, the examiner noted that the surgical records indicated there were no complications. The examiner opined that the medical evidence showed no evidence of worsening following surgery. Therefore, the examiner concluded it was less likely than not that sinusitis was caused by or became worse as a result of VA surgery. The examined stated that sinusitis was a chronic and recurrent condition and was not related to the 2019 septorhinoplasty. See November 2022 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). There is no medical opinion, or other competent evidence, to the contrary.

?

After a review of all the evidence under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for sinusitis.

Put simply, there is overwhelming evidence that VA did not cause an additional disability, as noted in the VA treatment records and 2022 medical opinion. (Parenthetically, the Board points out that service connection for allergic rhinitis was granted in a 2019 rating decision.) The evidence does not show that VA hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination resulted in additional disability of sinusitis. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(c)(1). The Veteran's claim is denied.
