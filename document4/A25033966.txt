ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for menorrhagia is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for costochondritis is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy left upper extremity is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for restless leg syndrome is granted.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had fibromyalgia at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that menorrhagia began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The Veteran's costochondritis, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities, and restless leg syndrome are proximately due to her service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with panic attacks and substance abuse.

4. Since the initial grant of service connection, the Veteran experienced migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring no more than once every month, and did not manifest in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for fibromyalgia are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for menorrhagia are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for costochondritis, including secondary to service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

4. The criteria for service connection for peripheral neuropathy left upper extremity, including secondary to service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

7. The criteria for an initial evaluation in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1997 to September 2004.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

A.	Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia.

B.	Entitlement to service connection for menorrhagia.

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), requesting review of a March 2022 rating decision, which denied the Veteran's claims seeking service connection for fibromyalgia and menorrhagia.  In April 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the April 2023 HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2022 decision.  

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 rating decision.

C.	Remaining Claims on Appeal 

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, HLR, requesting review of an April 2022 rating decision, which denied the Veteran's remaining claims on appeal herein.  In April 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2022 decision.  

In the November 2023 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, as to the remaining claims on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 rating decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia.

The Veteran contends that she has fibromyalgia related to her military service.  Alternatively, she claims that this condition is secondary to her service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of fibromyalgia and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran underwent VA examinations for fibromyalgia in July 2019 and February 2022.  Both of these VA examiners concluded that the Veteran did not have fibromyalgia.  In reaching this conclusion, both VA examiners considered the evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements; physically examined the Veteran; and also supported their no current diagnosis conclusions with sufficient rationale.  

Post service treatment records also do not contain a diagnosis of fibromyalgia supported by factual findings.

While the Veteran believes she has a current diagnosis of fibromyalgia, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim; the evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for fibromyalgia is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for menorrhagia.

The Veteran contends that she has menorrhagia related to her military service.  She attributes this condition to an inservice sexual assault, which resulted in pregnancy with preterm labor at seven months with loss of child.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of menorrhagia, and evidence shows that her inservice incident occurred, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that her menorrhagia began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

VA treatment records show the Veteran was not diagnosed with menorrhagia until years after separation from service.  While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding intermittently since service, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that these symptoms were manifestations of menorrhagia.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the interaction between multiple organ systems in the body and medical pathology. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. 

The March 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's menorrhagia is less likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's service treatment records were reviewed, including records relating to her inservice sexual assault and preterm labor, and that there were no medical records showing treatment for or diagnosis of menorrhagia.  The VA examiner also cited the lack of any post service history of treatment for or diagnosis of this condition for many years after service. 

In rendering this opinion, the examiner considered the evidence of record, including the Veteran's statements, prior to forming this opinion.  The VA examiner also physically examined the Veteran; and supported the opinion provided with a sufficient rationale.  The VA examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Veteran believes that her claimed menorrhagia is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  She is, however, not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the interaction between multiple organ systems in the body and medical pathology.  Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that she has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the VA examiner's opinion.

The persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim; the evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for menorrhagia is denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for costochondritis.

4. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy left upper extremity.

5. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy left lower extremity.

6. Entitlement to service connection for restless leg syndrome.

The Veteran contends that she has costochondritis, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities, and restless leg syndrome, secondary to her service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse.  

The February 2022 VA examination for bones and other skeletal conditions concluded with a diagnosis of costochondritis.  

The February 2022 VA examination for peripheral nerve conditions show that the Veteran currently has peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities and bilateral restless leg syndrome.  

The February 2022 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's costochondritis, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities, and restless leg syndrome, were at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of her service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse.  The VA examiners reached this conclusion based upon a review of the Veteran's claims file, consideration of the Veteran's contentions, and physical examination of the Veteran.  Moreover, the VA examiners provided a rationale for each of these conclusions.  

There are no conflicting medical opinions of record.  Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current costochondritis, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities, and restless leg syndrome are proximately due to her service-connected PTSD with panic attacks and substance abuse.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for costochondritis, peripheral neuropathy of the left upper and left lower extremities, and restless leg syndrome is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102."

7. Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 30 percent for migraine headaches.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule of Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent   the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating many accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a questions as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability pictures more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Veteran contends that her migraine headaches warrant assignment of an increased initial evaluation. 

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100, for migraine.  Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  A 50 percent rating is the highest schedular rating under Diagnostic Code 8100.

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contains several undefined phrases.  The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.  The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless.  Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract."  Id. (internal citation omitted).  Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability."  Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 445-46 (2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran has had migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8100.  

The Veteran's February 2022 VA examination for headaches noted the Veteran's complaints of pulsating or throbbing headaches with pain on both sides of the head.  She also reported symptoms of dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound.  The examination report noted that the Veteran's headaches result in characteristic prostrating attacks occurring once every month and typically last one to two days.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran does not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The report indicated that the Veteran's migraines do impact her ability to work, including having difficulty concentrating and focusing on completing tasks with flare ups of prostrating migraines.

The Veteran is competent to report her readily observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran reported her symptomatology to VA examiner, and her credibility in reporting her symptoms is accepted.  

In reaching its conclusion herein, the Board is cognizant of the fact that the Veteran uses medications, including Topiramate, Naproxen, and Tylenol, to treat her migraine headaches.  The Court has held that in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  More recently, the Court stated that the "the Board [is] obligated to discount the beneficial effects of the medication taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity of those disabilities." Ingram v. Shinseki, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025).  Diagnostic Code 8100 does not contemplate the ameliorative effect of medication when evaluating migraine headaches. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

The Board notes, however, that neither Jones nor Ingram address how the Board is to discount the beneficial effects of medication, particularly when used as treatment for an ongoing, yet intermittent, condition such as migraine headaches.

Remanding this appeal to order an addendum medical opinion based on Jones and Ingram, and in the lens of the rating criteria under § 4.124a, would require an examiner to engage in medical speculation and would result in a medical opinion that lacks the degree of certainty to ascertain, even under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard, the impact of the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches. See, e.g., Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2005) (medical opinions that are speculative have "little probative value").  f

Because it is highly unlikely that remand to obtain a medical opinion as to the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's migraine headaches would result in a probative, non-speculative opinion as to such, the Board does not wish to further delay adjudication of the Veteran's appeal to engage in likely unfruitful further development pursuant to Jones and Ingram.  Moreover, the Board certainly cannot - and will not - order the Veteran to stop taking medication for an extended period of time to undergo an examination that would reflect the true severity of her migraine headaches without the use of medication. This would not only be cruel and potentially damaging to the Veteran, but the undersigned finds it would be legally unethical to ask such.

The Board also notes that VA compensation does not contemplate hypothetical symptoms or impairment.  Instead, the purpose of VA benefits is to compensate for decreased earning capacity - to compensate for actual symptoms or impairment that an individual experiences in the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

Considering all relevant evidence of record, the Board concludes that the Veteran has had migraine headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average no more than once a month throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8100.  

A higher 50 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8100 is not warranted unless there are migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran's service-connected migraine headaches have not exhibited and/or been capable of producing this level of severity at any point during this appeal.  Moreover, the evidence of record does not indicate or suggest that the Veteran's condition would be this severe without her use of ameliorative medications.  Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran does not have migraine headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability at any time during the appeal period.  A higher 50 percent evaluation is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 8100.
