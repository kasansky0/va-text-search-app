ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for a right hip strain, limitation of flexion, prior to February 25, 2021, is denied.

 FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the period under review, right hip flexion was not limited to 45 degrees or worse.

2. The Veteran's additional functional impairment caused by hip pain has been compensated under the rating for impairment of the thigh, limitation of abduction with motion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected right hip strain with limitation of flexion have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5252.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to August 2016.

This matter originally came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 supplemental claim rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested a review of the October 2022 rating decision. In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 decision which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that, after the filing of the January 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating for his service-connected right hip disability. Thereafter, a February 2025 rating decision increased the current rating of the right hip with limitation of flexion to 10 percent disabling, effective October 21, 2024, and decreased ratings for limitation of extension and limitation of abduction 10 percent disabling to noncompensable, effective March 1, 2025. In this regard, the Board reiterates that it may not review, or consider, any evidence which was associated with the record after the October 2022 rating decision on appeal. As such, consideration has been limited accordingly.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations should be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if that disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).

Where a claimant appeals the denial of a claim of an increased disability rating for a disability for which service connection was in effect before he filed the claim for increase, the present level of disability is the primary concern, and past medical reports should not be given precedence over current medical findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 57-58 (1994). Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy, and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different, or "staged," ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-510 (2007).

When evaluating a musculoskeletal disability, VA must consider functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45. These determinations are, if feasible, to be expressed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to any weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, flare-ups, or pain. The examiner should also determine the point, if any, at which such factors cause functional impairment. See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 33 (2017); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43-44 (2011); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for a right hip strain with limitation of flexion prior to February 25, 2021, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher rating for his service-connected right hip for limitation of flexion with painful motion. See January 2024 Notice of Disagreement. 

As background, the Veteran's right hip strain was initially rated under DC 5252 for limitation of flexion of the thigh, and DC 5253 for limitation of abduction of the thigh with painful motion. The ratings were assigned from September 1, 2016. On February 25, 2021, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim form. In May 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating of his right hip with limitation of abduction. The AOJ adjudicated all the Veteran's right hip disability evaluation in a July 2021 rating decision. In the October 24, 2022, supplemental claim rating decision, the Veteran was granted a separate rating for limitation of extension of the thigh, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from February 25, 2021. The noncompensable rating for the right hip with limitation of flexion was continued from February 25, 2021, the date of the Veteran's intent to file form. 

The 10 percent ratings for limitation of abduction and extension of the right hip under DC 5251 and DC 5253, respectively, have not been appealed. Presently on appeal is the noncompensable rating for the right hip, limitation of flexion, rated under DC 5252.

Under DC 5252, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5252.

Under DC 5253, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.

On February 7, 2021, amendments to the schedule for rating musculoskeletal disabilities went into effect. See 85 Fed. Reg. 76453. Here, the Board notes that relative to said amendments, DC 5252 was not impacted.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable rating for his limitation of flexion for his right hip because the functional loss caused by pain on flexion has been evaluated in the 10 percent rating under DC 5253. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran has not had limitations of flexion below 45 degrees, and that compensation for functional loss attributed to pain has already been captured by the current disability rating for his right hip. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2016. The examination report shows that the Veteran reported shooting pain down his leg that he mitigated with stretching. Initial range of motion testing revealed right hip flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 45 degrees, and adduction to 25 degrees. Adduction was limited such that the Veteran could not cross his legs. The examiner noted that functional loss during range of motion testing was shown by the Veteran not being able to cross his legs. Pain was reported on flexion. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with three repetitions and post-test range of motion results did not reveal any additional limitation, functional loss, or functional impairment. The Veteran had normal strength in his right hip. The VA examiner did not find that the Veteran suffered from localized tenderness or pain to palpation for joints/soft tissue of the right hip, ankylosis, malunion or nonunion of femur, flail hip joint or leg length discrepancy. 

In November 2020, the AOJ obtained an addendum opinion to clarify whether pain, weakness, fatigability or incoordination significantly limited the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time or during flare-ups. The examiner reported no, as to both repeated use and flare-ups.

Relative to the October 2016 and November 2020 VA examiner's findings, the Veteran's right hip did not manifest with flexion limited to 45 degrees as contemplated by the 10 percent rating criteria under DC 5252.

In June 2021, the Veteran was afforded another examination for his right hip. The Veteran reported that his right hip pain has worsened over the years and that he currently experiences hip pain and stiffness. Further, he reported flare-ups of the right hip that occurred several times per week and lasted about three hours, precipitated by standing, walking, jogging, or climbing stairs. Range of motion testing revealed right hip flexion to 90 degrees with evidence of pain, extension to 20 degrees, abduction to 35 degrees and adduction to 20 degrees. External rotation was shown to be 40 degrees and internal rotation was 30 degrees. Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion. There was evidence of pain on weight-bearing, active motion and passive motion. The examiner found that the Veteran's pain manifested as stiffness, limited range of motion, difficulty standing for more than 30 minutes, walking more than half a mile, or climbing stairs with more than two flights. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with three repetitions. Post-test range of motion results revealed flexion endpoint was limited to 80 degrees, extension was 15 degrees, abduction was 30 degrees, and adduction was 15 degrees. The examiner noted functional loss was indicated on range of motion after three repetitions testing by pain and lack of endurance. The examiner estimated that range of motion after repeated use over time was limited to 70 degrees for flexion, 10 degrees for extension, 25 degrees for abduction, and 10 degrees for adduction. During a flare-up, flexion endpoint was estimated at 60 degrees, extension at 5 degrees, abduction at 20 degrees, and adduction at 5 degrees. The VA examiner did not find that the Veteran suffered from localized tenderness or pain to palpation for joints/soft tissue of the right hip, ankylosis, malunion or nonunion of femur, flail hip joint or leg length discrepancy.

In sum, the June 2021 examination shows that the Veteran's right hip strain did not manifest with flexion limited to 45 degrees, as contemplated by the 10 percent rating criteria under DC 5252. 

During the period on appeal the Veteran's right hip flexion endpoints were greater than 45 degrees, even when considering the VA examiner's estimated range of motion immediately after repeated use and during flare-ups in the June 2021 examination. While he was given the opportunity to describe functional limitation related to the disability, the Veteran's statements alone do not show the requisite limitation of motion necessary for a higher rating for limitation of flexion. 

Caselaw requires the Board to take due consideration that the beneficial effects of medication are discounted unless such effects are otherwise contemplated in a particular diagnostic code. See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, ___ Vet. App. ___ (2025). In this case, the VA examiner, in rendering range of motion findings, noted and considered the Veteran's lay statements describing functional limitations when his pain and functional impairment is at its worst (e.g., during flare-ups, on repetitive motion, due to lack of endurance, lack of coordination, etc.). The examination report as a whole does not indicate whether the Veteran was on any pain medications at the time of the examination, but in any case, it is clear the examiner already provided an opinion estimating range of motion findings discounting any potential ameliorating effects of medication. As such, the Board finds the report and the remainder of the evidentiary record adequate to base a decision, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor. 

Here, the RO considered the additional functional limitation of the Veteran's pain on flexion with the Veteran's limitation of abduction and elevated the evaluation accordingly. See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45. Accordingly, the RO assigned a noncompensable rating for the limitation of flexion based on the absence of a compensable limitation of motion under DC 5252. To assign separate ratings for limited flexion for the same symptoms contemplated by the 10 percent rating for abduction, namely: noncompensable limited and painful motion, would violate the rule against pyramiding. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (2004) (discussing how separate ratings may be assigned under DCs 5260 and 5261 where there is a compensable limitation of flexion and extension in the context of knee disabilities). Here, the symptoms related to painful motion and other limited motions, separate from flexion, were evaluated under the 10 percent rating for limitation of abduction.

Notably, where manifestations of a musculoskeletal disability causing additional functional limitation result in elevation of the evaluation pursuant to the factors outlined in DeLuca, those manifestations cannot be further compensated for separate evaluation and pyramiding purposes. See Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). Specifically, when a veteran receives a higher evaluation for the joint based on pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, he cannot receive a higher evaluation for the same joint based on the same "DeLuca factors," in light of the rule against pyramiding that prohibits compensating the veteran twice for the same manifestations afflicting the same joint. see DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45. 

This is also supported by the holding in Mitchell where the Court reiterated that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 allows for a single 10 percent rating for painful motion of a joint, not for painful motion under each of the limitation-of-motion diagnostic codes. The holding in Mitchell supports that the "DeLuca factors" can be considered only once, when rating the joint as a whole, and not when rating each plane of motion. Therefore, because the RO applied the "DeLuca factor" when assigning a 10 percent rating under DC 5253, the Veteran's pain for his right hip cannot also be compensated under DC 5252, limitation of flexion.

For all these reasons, a separate compensable rating of 10 percent based on painful flexion cannot be assigned for the period prior to February 25, 2021. 

As the evidence is not in approximate balance and is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
