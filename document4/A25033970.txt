ORDER

The appeal of basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code (Chapter 33 or Post-9/11 GI Bill), is DENIED.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is not shown to have served a qualifying period of active duty service for Chapter 33 purposes after September 10, 2001. 

2. The Veteran was not separated from service after 30 days of service due to a service-connected disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits are not met. 10 U.S.C. § 2107(b); 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), (22)(A), (24)(B), 3002, 3301, 3311; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.9500, 21.9505, 21.9520.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 2019 to January 2020.  The Appellant is his surviving spouse.   

The case is on appeal to the Board from an August 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office decision that denied basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 on the basis of the Veteran's character of discharge and insufficient qualifying active-duty service.  

In the April 2021 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182) the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

Prior to his death in May 2024, the Veteran sought entitlement to educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33 to pursue a program of education at Montclair State University.  Here, the Veteran's spouse has been granted substitution for all appeals pending before VA at the time of his death by virtue of a most recent April 2025 AOJ decision.  Thus, the Board will proceed to address the appeal on the merits.     

In an August 2020 decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to education benefits under Chapter 33 on the basis that the Veteran did not meet basic eligibility requirements such as sufficient qualifying active duty service after September 10, 2001, and because the Veteran did not receive an honorable discharge.

In his April 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's sole argument was that entitlement to the benefit sought is warranted because his character of discharge was upgraded to "honorable conditions."  

Applicable law provides that eligibility for education benefits under Chapter 33 is based on certain qualifying periods and types of active duty for individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3301-3324; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

Generally, an individual must have served a minimum of 90 aggregate days of active duty excluding active duty for entry level and skill training and, after completion of such service, (1) continued on active duty; (2) was discharged from service with an honorable discharge; (3) was released from service characterized as honorable and placed on the retired list, temporary disability retired list, or transferred to the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve; (4) was released from service characterized as honorable for further service in a reserve component; or (5) was discharged or released from service for a medical condition that preexisted such service and is not determined to be service connected; hardship, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned; or a physical or mental condition that interfered with the individual's performance of duty but was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own misconduct. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a).  

38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b), which is the implementing regulation to 38 U.S.C. § 3311(b)(2), provides that alternatively, a veteran may establish eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits if he or she served a minimum of 30 continuous days and, after completion of such service, is discharged under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).  

The Veteran's DD Form 214 reflect that he received an "Uncharacterized" discharge from the Army due "Entry Level Performance and Conduct."  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(l)(1), uncharacterized entry level separations are considered under "conditions other than dishonorable."  

The evidence shows that the Veteran did not meet the basic requirements for entitlement to basic eligibility for Chapter 33 benefits under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a), which establishes basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 33, if an individual served a minimum of 90 aggregate days, but expressly excluding entry level and skill training.  In this case, the Veteran was discharged from service after 32 days at entry level.  

However, the exclusion of entry level and skill training service is not imposed or contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).  As discussed above, service members need only to have completed at least 30 days of service and discharged under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability. 

So, the remaining question for the Board is whether the Veteran was entitled to Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits on the basis of an under other than dishonorable conditions discharge due to a service-connected disability after having served at least 30 continuous days on active duty. 

A review of the Veteran's service personnel records does not show that the Veteran was recommended for separation from service due to a service-connected disability.  Review of the Veteran's service treatment records show that on December 30, 2019, the first day of his entry level training, the Veteran endorsed being in good health.  

On January 14, 2020, the Veteran was seen by a mental health provider after he ran from his drill sergeants and attempted to jump into the back of a moving vehicle to leave post and go on absence without leave (AWOL).  The Veteran was detained by the military police and was transported to the emergency room for a risk assessment.  At the time of his evaluation the Veteran reported "no current or recent suicidal thoughts plans or intent" and acknowledged that he was attempting to jump into the vehicle in order to go AWOL.  

As a result of the incident, the Veteran's company commander requested his expedited separation.  The medical provider indicated that the Veteran had a past history of depression and suicidal attempts in 2013 and 2015, but none present since 2015.  

On January 16, 2020, the Veteran underwent a medical assessment for separation.  The report indicates that the Veteran had been seen at the emergency room for back and ear pain, and for counseling for mental health services for behavioral issues.  The provider, however, indicated that all medical concerns that prompted the assessment were evaluated, treated, and cleared.  The Veteran was recommended for entry level separation.   

The Veteran denied any complaints or concerns at that time.  A pain assessment revealed his pain at 0 out of 10 (no pain), and a PHQ-2 Depression Screen test conducted during the assessment resulted negative.  The health provider noted that the Veteran had not been in a situation where he was verbally or physically hurt, threatened, or made to feel afraid.  The report further indicates that the Veteran was not on a medical profile or on limited duty.          

Upon review of the record evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran was not separated from service due to a service-connected disability but as documented in his DD Form 214, due to performance and conduct that did not meet military standards.  In support of the foregoing, the Board has considered the Veteran's acknowledgement to his health provider that the January 14, 2020 incident that prompted his recommendation for separation was to go on AWOL and not due to a disability.  The Board has also considered the fact that during the January 16, 2020, subsequent medical assessment, the Veteran denied pain, depression, suicidal ideation or intent.    

The Board has considered that the Veteran was granted service connection for depression effective January 31, 2020, the day following separation from service.  Upon review of the VA medical opinion relied on by the AOJ to award the benefit, the Board finds no rationale or explanation linking the January 14, 2020 incident that led to his recommendation for separation to any mental health disorder the Veteran may have experienced during service.  As discussed above, while the Veteran endorsed a history of depression prior to service, the Veteran himself acknowledged that the reason for his actions was to go on AWOL.  Moreover, the health provider who conducted the January 16, 2020 Report of Medical Assessment confirmed that all medical concerns, to include any associated with mental health disorders were evaluated, treated, and cleared.  Thus, the provisions set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b) are not applicable to the facts of this case.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the Veteran is not shown to have served a qualifying period of active-duty service for Chapter 33 purposes after September 10, 2001, or that he was separated from service after 30 days of service due to a service-connected disability.  Accordingly, entitlement to basic eligibility to educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill is denied.
