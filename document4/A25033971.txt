DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 4, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that he intended to withdraw his appeal as to the issues of entitlement to service connection for PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1988 to September 1998.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

In an October 4, 2024, written statement, the Veteran indicated he wished to withdraw his appeal. The Veteran's statement satisfied the requirements for withdrawal because it explicit and unambiguous stated the desire to withdraw, in writing, and identified his name, VA claims file number, and the intent to withdraw "all ongoing claims including appeals." See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020). Therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal as to PTSD, and it is dismissed.
