REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2016 to May 2020.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2022 and August 2023 rating decisions of a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a December 2022 decision.  In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for irritable bowel syndrome

The Veteran seeks service connection for irritable bowel syndrome.  She asserts such a disability began during active duty service, and service connection is therefore warranted.  In the alternative, she asserts this disability is due to or aggravated by her other service-connected disabilities, and service connection is therefore warranted on a secondary basis.  

Law and Regulations

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service.  For the showing of "chronic" disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  With chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service-connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of "continuity of symptoms" after service is required for service connection.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.? Id.  Finally, service connection may be awarded for a disability caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability or disabilities.  

Analysis

The service medical records are negative for any diagnosis of or treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.  The Veteran has reported, however, that shortly after service entrance in 2016, she began to experience such abdominal symptoms as abdominal pain, frequent bowel movements, and loose stools.  On VA examination in June 2022, irritable bowel syndrome, with onset in 2016, was diagnosed.  Regarding the etiology of the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome, the VA examiner opined that her current irritable bowel syndrome was unrelated to service, as the Veteran consistently denied diarrhea, stomach problems, or related problems while undergoing multiple examinations during service.  Thus, the examiner opined, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome was unrelated to service.  

The Board notes that while this VA examiner determined the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome was not related to service, this same examiner listed "2016", the same year the Veteran entered service, as the date of onset.  Additionally, the Veteran is competent to report such observable symptoms as stomach pain and loose stools, as these are observable by laypersons.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence).  

In light of this evidence and after affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds service connection for irritable bowel syndrome is warranted.  The appeal as to this issue is thus granted.  

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for a lumbosacral strain

The Veteran seeks a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for her service-connected lumbosacral strain.  She asserts this disability has worsened in severity, and an increased rating is therefore warranted.  

Law and Regulations

Disability evaluations are based upon the average impairment of earning capacity as contemplated by the schedule for rating disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  In adjudicating increased rating claims, the level of disability in all periods since the effective date of the grant of service connection must be taken into account, to include the possibility that a staged rating may be assigned.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  As such, the Board will consider whether staged ratings are appropriate to the pending appeals.  In cases in which a reasonable doubt arises as to the appropriate degree of disability to be assigned, such doubt shall be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

Disabilities of the spine are generally rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (for Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243, unless 5243 is evaluated under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes).  Ratings under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine are made with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.  

The General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides the following:  

With or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease

Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine						100

Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine				50

Unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine; or, forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine									40

Forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis				20

Forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height							10

Note (1): Evaluate any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code.

Note (2): (See also Plate V.) For VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the cervical spine is zero to 45 degrees, extension is zero to 45 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 45 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 80 degrees. Normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees. The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  The normal combined range of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees and of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.  The normal ranges of motion for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined range of motion.

Note (3): In exceptional cases, an examiner may state that because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that individual, even though it does not conform to the normal range of motion stated in Note (2). Provided that the examiner supplies an explanation, the examiner's assessment that the range of motion is normal for that individual will be accepted.

Note (4): Round each range of motion measurement to the nearest five degrees.

Note (5): For VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

Note (6): Separately evaluate disability of the thoracolumbar and cervical spine segments, except when there is unfavorable ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-43.  

Spinal disabilities may also be rated under the criteria for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), if applicable.  Intervertebral disc syndrome with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months warranted a 60 percent rating.  With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted.  With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted.  With incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted.  An "incapacitating episode" is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243, Note 1.  

With any form of arthritis or other orthopedic disorders, painful motion is an important factor of disability.  Joints that are actually painful, unstable, or misaligned, due to healed injury, should be entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  Special note should be taken of objective indications of pain on pressure or manipulation, muscle spasm, crepitation, and active and passive range of motion of both the damaged joint and the opposite undamaged joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  While pain alone does not constitute functional loss, the Court has clearly indicated that the Board must consider the effects of pain, particularly as to any adverse impact on the normal working movements of the body.  Mitchell, 25 Vet. App at 44 (noting that although "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss," pain which "affects some aspect of 'the normal working movements of the body' such as 'excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance,'" may constitute functional loss).  Additionally, the Board must consider pain on both active and passive motion of the affected joint, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  

However, a veteran may be entitled to a higher disability evaluation than that supported by mechanical application of the rating schedule where there is evidence that his or her disability causes "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability... to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' including as due to pain and/or other factors" or "reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination."  Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 117-18 (2017) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 36-37 (2011); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-07 (1995).  In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34 (2017), the Court noted that the VA Clinician's Guide instructs examiners when evaluating certain musculoskeletal conditions to obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from a veteran.  

Finally, the Board notes that even if a claimant does not have ankylosis, if his functional loss during a flare-up is severe enough, he she can be entitled to a finding of ankylosis.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 11 (2021); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.  

Analysis

In the present case, the Veteran has been granted a 10 percent rating for her lumbosacral strain.  On VA examination in May 2022, she reported sharp pain of the lumbosacral spine, especially with use.  No history of spinal surgery was noted.  On range of motion testing, active and passive spinal motion included forward flexion to 80 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, lateral flexion to 30 degrees bilaterally, and lateral rotation to 30 degrees bilaterally.  The Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  Repetitive motion or repeated use over time also did not result in additional limitation of motion.  The examiner reported no additional limitation of motion due to such factors as pain, fatiguability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination.  Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensory response for the lower extremities were all within normal limits.  Straight leg raising was positive bilaterally.  Radiculopathy of the lower extremities was noted.  Ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine was not present, nor was intervertebral disc syndrome.  The Veteran did not require an assistance device to aid mobility.  The final impression was of a lumbosacral strain.  

Another VA examination was afforded the Veteran in September 2022.  She reported continuing sharp pain in the lumbosacral spine, worsening with use, for which she used over-the-counter medication.  On initial range of motion testing, her motion of the lumbosacral spine was within normal limits on all planes of motion.  She exhibited forward flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, lateral flexion to 30 degrees bilaterally, and lateral rotation to 30 degrees bilaterally.  Pain was reported with motion; this did not result in any additional limitation of motion, however.  The examiner reported no additional limitation of motion due to such factors as pain, fatiguability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination.  Repetitive motion or repeated motion over time did not result in any additional limitation of motion.  No flare-ups were reported.  Localized tenderness was present, but the Veteran was without muscle spasm or guarding.  Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensory response for the lower extremities were all within normal limits.  Crepitus was not present.  Straight leg raising was negative bilaterally.  Radiculopathy was present in both lower extremities.  Ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine was not present, nor was intervertebral disc syndrome.  The Veteran used a waist belt to aid mobility.  The final impression was of a lumbosacral strain.  

The record also contains outpatient treatment records and the results from imagining scans of the Veteran's spine.  These records do not demonstrate symptomatology more severe than what was reported in the above-discussed examination. 

After considering the totality of the record, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's low back disability.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms such as pain and functional loss.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that she has low back pain would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees.  Furthermore, the Veteran does not have additional limitation of motion following repetitive use, repeated use over time, or due to such factors as pain, weakness, fatiguability, or incoordination, as would warrant an increased rating.  

Additionally, the Veteran did not have muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  As such, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted under the general criteria for spinal disabilities.  Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, as noted above, the Veteran does not have intervertebral disc syndrome, according to the VA examination reports.

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection and compensable ratings for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities and the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability.  Moreover, the Veteran's bilateral radiculopathy of the sciatic nerves will be addressed below.  

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for her low back disability.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38  U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).  

3. Entitlement to an increased rating for a right hip strain

4. Entitlement to an increased rating for a left hip strain

The Veteran seeks increased ratings for her bilateral hip disabilities.  10 percent disability ratings have been granted for each hip.  She asserts these disabilities have increased in severity, and increased ratings are therefore warranted.  

The general criteria for the evaluation of service-connected disabilities have been noted above and are incorporated herein by reference.  The Veteran's bilateral hip strains are rated as under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5252, for limitation of the flexion of the thigh.  Under this Code, a 10 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 45 degrees; a 20 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 30 degrees; a 30 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 20 degrees; and a maximum 40 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 10 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5252.  Additionally, DC 5251, for limitation of extension of the thigh, provides a single rating of 10 percent for extension limited to 5 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5251.  Under DC 5253, for limitation of abduction, adduction, and/or rotation, limitation of rotation to 15 degrees or less is afforded a 10 percent rating.  Limitation of adduction of the thigh, implying an inability to cross the legs, is afforded a 10 percent rating.  Limitation of abduction of the thigh, with motion lost beyond 10 degrees, is afforded a 20 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.  

Upon receipt of her claim, the Veteran was afforded an August 2022 VA examination.  She reported severe bilateral hip pain, especially with use, and occasional falls due to her hip pain.  She used medication for her hip pain.  On range of motion testing, she had, with active and passive motion of each hip, flexion to 110 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 45 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 40 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  Pain was reported with motion.  She was able to cross her legs.  Crepitus was not present in either hip.  The Veteran could perform repetitive use testing for the left hip, but not the right hip, due to fear of pain.  For the left hip, no additional limitation of motion resulted from repetitive use testing.  Such factors as pain, weakness, fatigability, and lack of endurance resulted in additional limitation of motion, with findings as follows: flexion to 90 degrees bilaterally, extension to 25 degrees bilaterally, abduction to 35 degrees on the right and 40 degrees on the left, adduction to 20 degrees bilaterally, external rotation to 35 degrees on the right and 30 degrees on the left, and internal rotation to 30 degrees on the right and 25 degrees on the left.  

During flare-ups, the examiner estimated range of motion for the right hip would include flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, abduction to 45 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 40 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  For the left hip, range of motion would remain the same during a flare-up.  No muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or other impairment of the femur or hip joint was noted.  The Veteran denied any surgical history of the hips.  She did not require any assistance devices to aid mobility.  

Upon consideration of the totality of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against increased ratings for the Veteran's bilateral hip disabilities.  The Veteran does not have limitation of flexion to 30 degrees for either hip, as would warrant the next higher evaluation of 20 percent.  Additionally, the Board finds that a schedular compensable rating for hip limitation of motion under DC 5253 is not warranted as limitation of adduction, abduction, or rotation to a compensable degree is not demonstrated.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5253.  Nevertheless, as the Veteran has reported painful motion, she has already been granted a compensable rating of 10 percent for each hip under DC 5252.  Similarly, a compensable rating for limitation of extension under DC 5251 is not warranted as the evidence of record does not support a finding that extension of either hip is limited to 5 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5251.  While the Veteran and her representative have asserted she has painful motion of both hips, she has already been awarded a compensable rating for this symptom.  The Court has held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 provides a single compensable rating for painful motion of a single joint, not for each plane of motion of the affected joint.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).

Regarding other criteria for the hip, the Veteran does not have nonunion or malunion of the femur, ankylosis, or flail joint of either hip.  Thus, entitlement to a separate compensable rating pursuant to these criteria is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5250-54.  Further, the Board finds that the 10 percent rating already awarded for each hip accurately encompasses the Veteran's reported flare-up symptomology of having difficulty bending her legs and painful motion.  

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against entitlement to disability ratings in excess of 10 percent for either hip, and the appeal is thus denied as to those issues.  In denying increased ratings, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.  

5. Entitlement to an increased rating for sciatic nerve radiculopathy of the right lower extremity

6. Entitlement to an increased rating for sciatic nerve radiculopathy of the left lower extremity

The Veteran seeks disability ratings in excess of 10 percent each for sciatic nerve radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  She asserts these disabilities result in additional impairment not contemplated by her current ratings, and increased ratings are therefore warranted.  

The Veteran has been granted a 10 percent disability rating for each lower extremity under Diagnostic Code (DC) 8520, for impairment of the sciatic nerve.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.  

The VBA Adjudication Manual (M21-1) provides general guidelines for each level of incomplete paralysis of the upper and lower peripheral nerves.  Mild incomplete paralysis can be described as a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.  A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment.  Symptoms will likely be described as significantly disabling.  Combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) are graded as medically moderate.  Severe incomplete paralysis includes motor and/or reflex impairment such as atrophy, weakness, or diminished hyperactive reflexes at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases.  See M21-1, Part III, Subpart iv, Chapter 4, Section N, Topic 4, Assigning Level of Incomplete Paralysis, Neuritis, or Neuralgia. 

The Board acknowledges that when relying on any M21-1 provision, the Board must independently review the matter the M21-1 addresses.  If after such review, the Board chooses to rely on the M21-1 as a factor in its analysis or as the rule of decision, it must provide adequate reasons or bases for doing so.  The Board may not simply rely on the nonbinding M21-1 position without analysis.  Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The Veteran was afforded a VA neurological examination in August 2022.  Her claims file was reviewed in conjunction with the examination.  She reported severe pain in both lower extremities, along with mild numbness and moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias.  On objective examination, she had normal strength and sensory response at the knees and ankles bilaterally.  Reflexes were also 2+ at the knees and ankles bilaterally.  No trophic changes were present, and her gait was within normal limits.  The examiner determined the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the lower extremities bilaterally.  She did not require an assistance device to aid standing or mobility.  The Veteran was noted to be a fulltime student at that time.  

After a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the lay and medical evidence does not demonstrate moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve in either lower extremity in order to warrant disability ratings in excess of 10 percent under DC 8520.  Rather, the evidence of record is persuasively against a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for either the right or left lower extremity based on sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  

Specifically, the evidence of record does not show any trophic changes in either lower extremity.  Additionally, sensory, strength, and reflex testing has been normal for both lower extremities during the period on appeal.  No muscle atrophy has been noted.  Regarding pain, the Veteran has described severe radiating pain, along with numbness, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, from her low back into her lower extremities.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that her pain of the bilateral lower extremities is severe; however, in light of the fact her strength, reflexes, and sensory response in the lower extremities are all within normal limits, this symptom alone does not warrant a higher disability rating.  

Additionally, the Veteran has not been found to have complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve of either lower extremity at any time during the period on appeal.  The August 2022 VA examination does not indicate complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve of the right or left lower extremity.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability is primarily manifest by pain radiating from the low back into each lower extremity.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability is manifest by impairment of motor functions, trophic changes, sensory disturbance, loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.  The Board thus concludes that the level of impairment is most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis for each lower extremity.  

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, separate or higher ratings under a different DC are not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for a rating in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy of the right or left lower extremity.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against ratings in excess of 10 percent for each lower extremity, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

7. Entitlement to a TDIU

The Veteran seeks a TDIU.  She asserts her service-connected disabilities prevent her from obtaining or maintaining gainful employment, and a TDIU is therefore warranted.  

The Veteran has been in receipt of a 100 percent schedular rating effective from December 16, 2021.  Additionally, special monthly compensation at the (s) rate has also been awarded the Veteran, effective from March 11, 2022.  

In the present case, the claim of entitlement to TDIU has been rendered moot by the award of a 100 percent schedular evaluation for PTSD.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  The Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a veteran is totally disabled.  Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990).  Thus, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that veteran disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).  

Additionally, the Veteran has been granted special monthly compensation at the (s) rate, awarded when at least one disability is rated as 100 percent disabling, and an additional disability or disabilities combined are rated as 60 percent disabling.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 350(i).  As noted above, the award of special monthly compensation has been made effective from March 11, 2022, prior to the receipt of the Veteran's claim.  

Accordingly, the grant of a 100 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD renders the issue of entitlement to TDIU moot.  Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2010).

Effective dates

In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If, however, a claim is received within one year of service separation, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose,, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1)(ii), the effective date based on new and relevant evidence other than service department records received after the final disallowance is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r), the effective date based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002); Melton v. West, 13 Vet. App. 442 (2000).  

Additionally, an effective date for increased disability compensation may be earlier than the date of receipt of the application.  In such cases, the effective date shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim; if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  "An effective date earlier than the date of claim may be assigned if an increase in disability is shown within the one-year ("look-back") period prior to the receipt of a claim, but not where the increase is shown prior to the one-year period preceding the receipt of the claim."  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

For continuously pursued claims, except as otherwise provided by other provisions, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, provided that any appeal to the Court must be accepted as timely by that court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  A claimant can continuously pursue a claim by timely filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, appealing to the Board, or filing a notice of appeal to the Court.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

A "claim" is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  "Date of receipt" of a claim, information, or evidence means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

8. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 16, 2020, for the award of service connection for a lumbosacral strain

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to May 16, 2020, for the award of service connection and a 10 percent initial rating for a lumbosacral strain.  She separated from service effective May 15, 2020.  Pursuant to applicable regulations, an effective date prior to the day after service separation is prohibited.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  Thus, this claim must be denied as a matter of law, and the benefit of the doubt is not applicable.  

9. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for migraines

10. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for right leg sciatic nerve radiculopathy

11. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for left leg sciatic nerve radiculopathy

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the awards of service connection for migraine headaches and bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  In a May 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted separate service connection awards, effective March 11, 2022, for sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  In a July 2022 rating decision, service connection for migraine headaches was granted effective March 11, 2022.  

This effective date was assigned for these awards based on receipt on that date of a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, which included a service connection claim for headaches and an increased rating claim for a low back disability.  In developing this increased rating claim, the RO determined the Veteran had bilateral sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities secondary to her service-connected lumbosacral strain, and granted service connection for these disabilities on a secondary basis.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  

Review of the claims file does not reveal any prior claims for service connection for migraine headaches or radiculopathy of the lower extremities.  Moreover, the competent medical evidence of record prior to March 11, 2022, was negative for a diagnosis of radiculopathy of either lower extremity.  Specifically, a September 2020 VA spinal examination was negative for radiculopathy.  Radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve of the lower extremities was subsequently confirmed on VA examination dated May 3, 2022, after the receipt of her claim and the current effective date for these awards.  At no time prior to the March 2022 claim did the Veteran claim service connection for radiculopathy or headaches, and neither the Veteran nor her representative have pointed to any such prior pending claims.  Based on this evidence, the Board must conclude earlier effective dates are not warranted for these awards.  

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the award of effective dates prior to March 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for migraine headaches or radiculopathy of either lower extremity, and the appeal must be denied as to those issues.  As the evidence is against the award of an earlier effective date, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  

12. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 16, 2021, for the award of a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), borderline personality disorder, and alcohol use disorder

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to December 16, 2021, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD, borderline personality disorder, and alcohol use disorder.  

Service connection for PTSD was originally granted in a September 2020 rating decision.  A 30 percent initial rating, effective from May 16, 2020, the day after the Veteran's separation from active duty service, was granted.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR), on May 11, 2021, regarding the assigned initial rating.  In a July 2021 rating decision, the 30 percent award for PTSD was confirmed, and an increased rating was denied.  She was notified of this decision via a VA letter dated July 14, 201.  No further action was taken by the Veteran regarding this rating decision or the September 2020 rating decision.  It thus became final.  

On December 16, 2021, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.  The Veteran was afforded a December 23, 2021, VA psychiatric examination which noted occupational and social impairment in most areas, to include work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and mood.  VA then issued a January 2022 rating decision which granted the Veteran an increased rating, to 70 percent, for her PTSD, effective December 16, 2021, based on the results of the December 2021 VA examination.  The Veteran next filed a February 2022 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, regarding the effective date and disability rating for PTSD.  These appeals were denied in a March 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran again filed a July 2022 VA Form 20-0995 regarding her disability rating and assigned effective date.  In a December 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted an increased rating, from 70 percent to 100 percent for her PTSD, effective July 26, 2022.  In April 2023, the Veteran requested a HLR of this effective date.  The RO then issued an August 2023 rating decision which granted the present effective date of December 16, 2021, for the Veteran's 100 percent rating for PTSD.  

After reviewing the entirety of the record, the Board finds the evidence to be persuasively against an effective date prior to December 16, 2021, for the award of a 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD.  While the Veteran did seek HLR of her initial rating following the initial September 2020 rating decision granting service connection for PTSD, she was afforded a July 2021 HLR decision denying an increased initial rating, which she did not subsequently appeal.  Thus, the Veteran did not continuously pursue the increased initial rating claim because she did not file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, appeal to the Board, or file notice of appeal to the Court within one year of the most recent AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  While she did file the aforementioned December 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ within one year of the July 2021 rating decision, this is not one of the applicable review options to establish continuous pursuit under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Further, the Veteran did not file one of the applicable review options within one year of either the September 2020 or July 2021 rating decisions.  The Veteran was notified of these decisions in a timely manner and does not content otherwise.  Therefore, any claims prior to December 16, 2021, cannot serve as the basis for an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the effective date of December 16, 2021, the date of the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ claim, is the earliest possible effective date pursuant to the regulations in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Therefore, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent rating for PTSD is denied.  

13. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for service connection and a disability rating of 10 percent for right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome

14. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for service connection and a disability rating of 10 percent for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome

The Veteran seeks effective dates prior to March 13, 2022, for the award of service connection and 10 percent initial disability ratings for patellofemoral pain syndrome of the bilateral knees.  

On March 13, 2022, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 from the Veteran seeking service connection for a bilateral knee disability.  A June 2022 VA examination diagnosed patellofemoral pain syndrome of the bilateral knees.  In a July 2022 rating decision, service connection for patellofemoral pain syndrome of the bilateral knees, with 10 percent ratings for each knee, was granted effective March 13, 2022.  

Review of the file indicates the Veteran first claimed service connection for bilateral knee disabilities on a VA Form 21-526EZ, received on August 9, 2019, while the Veteran was still on active duty service.  This claim was denied in a May 29, 2020, rating decision, and the Veteran was so informed by a VA notification letter dated June 4, 2020.  

On June 29, 2020, the Veteran again filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claiming service connection for bilateral knee disabilities.  In response, VA sent a letter to the Veteran informing her she needed to file the proper form for review of the May 2020 denial.  On VA examination in September 2020, a VA physician determined the Veteran did not have current disabilities of either knee.  

As noted above, submission of a VA Form 21-526EZ does not constitute continuous pursuit of her service connection claim for bilateral knee disabilities.  The Veteran did not file one of the applicable review options, consisting of a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, appealing to the Board, or filing a notice of appeal to the Court, within one year of May 2020 rating decision.  The Veteran was notified of this decision in a timely manner and does not content otherwise.  Thereafter, while the Veteran resubmitted a VA Form 21-526EZ in July 2020 a subsequent September 2020 VA examination was negative for a disability of either knee.  Current bilateral knee disabilities were not established within the record until a June 2022 VA examination resulted in diagnoses of bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome.  Thus, even if the June 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ is accepted as the date of claim for purposes of the July 2022 rating decision granting service connection for bilateral knee disabilities, such disabilities were not established until the June 2022 VA examination, the date for which entitlement arose.  This date is after the March 13, 2022, effective date already granted the Veteran for her bilateral knee disabilities.  No other evidence establishing an earlier date of entitlement has been submitted by the Veteran.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the effective dates of March 13, 2022, the date of the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim, is the earliest possible effective date pursuant to the regulations at 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Therefore, the Veteran's claims for earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for bilateral knee disabilities are denied.  

15. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the grant of special monthly compensation based on housebound status

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the grant of special monthly compensation based on housebound status.  

Special monthly compensation based on housebound status was granted within a December 2022 rating decision.  This award was made effective from July 26, 2022.  In April 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, seeking HLR of this award.  In an August 2023 HLR decision, an earlier effective date, to March 11, 2022, was granted the Veteran.  This date was based on the receipt of a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, received on that date.  

Special monthly compensation may be granted to a Veteran on the basis of the need for regular aid and attendance from another person or of being housebound.  Special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) can satisfy the need for a rating of 100 percent for special monthly compensation at the housebound rate if it can be sustained by a single disability.  Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250-51 (2011).  

In the present case, the Veteran has not argued, nor does the evidence suggest, that the circumstances needed to establish being permanently housebound due to her service-connected disabilities are present in this case.  Instead, the Veteran seeks to establish the earliest possible effective date for her entitlement to special monthly compensation on a statutory basis; that is, based upon the ratings assigned for her service-connected disabilities.  In this regard, the award of service connection and a 30 percent initial rating for migraine headaches effective March 11, 2022, was sufficient to meet the threshold for special monthly compensation based on a single disability at 100 percent and additional disabilities combined to equal a 60 percent or higher disability rating.  Effective March 11, 2022, the Veteran was in receipt of service connection for PTSD, with a 100 percent rating, as well as; migraine headaches, with a 30 percent rating; a lumbosacral strain, with a 10 percent rating; tinnitus, with a 10 percent rating; bilateral sciatic radiculopathy of the lower extremities, with a 10 percent rating for each lower extremity; bilateral patellofemoral pain syndrome of the knees, with a 10 percent rating for each knee; bilateral hip strains resulting in limitation of flexion, with a 10 percent rating for each hip; bilateral hip strains resulting in limitation of extension, with a 10 percent rating for each hip, and; bilateral hip strains with pain, with noncompensable ratings.  

The Board notes that prior to March 11, 2022, the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirements described above to warrant special monthly compensation based upon statutory housebound criteria.  Additionally, the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran was actually permanently housebound due to her service-connected disabilities prior to that date.  As such, the evidence is persuasively against an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  The Veteran's claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to March 11, 2022, for the grant of special monthly compensation based on housebound status and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
