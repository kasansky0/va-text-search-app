ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for insomnia disorder (also claimed as sleep disorder) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

February 14, 2022, is the earliest date that a claim for service connection for insomnia was received.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for insomnia disorder (also claimed as sleep disorder) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2005 to October 2012. 

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2022 decision.  In June 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2022 decision.  

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the March 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date earlier than February 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for insomnia disorder (also claimed as sleep disorder) is denied.

The Veteran contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the grant of service connection for insomnia. She contends that VA should have evaluated her properly when she first filed her claim and provided a sleep study. 

Generally, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award of compensation is the date entitlement arose or the date the claim was received, whichever is later. In other words, the effective date is not earlier than the date of application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(h)(1).

In the modernized appeal system (AMA), 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(2) states: "For purposes of determining the effective date of an award under this section, the date of application shall be considered the date of the filing of the initial application for a benefit if the claim is continuously pursued."

VA received an informal claim for service connection for insomnia on April 16, 2013. See Report of General Information. VA characterized the claim "any sleep disorder, claimed as insomnia" and denied it in a rating decision issued in January 2015. The Veteran was notified in a letter mailed on January 23, 2015. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement with the insomnia determination and no additional evidence for the claim was received within the one year period following the notification letter, so the decision became final.

Next, on December 13, 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, writing, "I had been treated for insomnia on more than one instance while serving." However, the VA Form 21-526EZ does not establish a supplemental claim when the claimed benefit has been previously denied in a final decision; it is for new claims. 

Accordingly, a January 20, 2022 letter informed the Veteran that in order to review a claim for "sleep apnea that we previously denied as insomnia disorder on 01/23/2015," VA regulations required the claim be filed on the proper form.

In response, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, received on February 14, 2022. Attached to the claim was her statement, explaining that because of her long history of sleep problems that began during her military career, it did not occur to her to get tested for sleep apnea until recently when her husband suggested it. "Now I am sure my sleeping issues are tied to sleep apnea nad the way I worked as a soldier on active duty."

A March 2022 rating decision granted service connection for insomnia disorder (also claimed as sleep disorder) and assigned an effective date of February 14, 2022. 

The Veteran filed an HLR request on May 16, 2022, challenging the effective date assigned for service connection of insomnia. A June 15, 2022 HLR decision denied an earlier effective date, and the Veteran appealed that decision to the Board.

The Veteran continuously pursued entitlement to an earlier effective date from the February 14, 2022 Supplemental Claim to the grant of service connection. However, prior to February 14, 2022 there was no pending unadjudicated supplemental claim.

The April 2013 claim was closed when the January 2015 rating decision became final. After the January 2015 rating decision, no supplemental claim was filed for insomnia (or sleep disorders) until February 14, 2022.

VA regulations provide for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

The VA Form 21-526EZ received on December 13, 2021 is not a supplemental claim and was not accepted as a valid claim by VA. Therefore, December 13, 2021 cannot be the date of claim.

The Board understands that the Veteran has experienced sleep symptoms long before February 14, 2022. In other words, entitlement to the disability arose prior to the date of claim. The effective date may not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.

In sum, the effective date was assigned based on the VA Form 20-0995 received on February 14, 2022, and the Board finds no legal basis for assigning an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for insomnia.  Accordingly, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
