REMANDED

Entitlement to additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Army Reserve.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to additional Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits is remanded.

The Veteran claims entitlement to Chapter 33 education benefits. 

The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim because documents in the claims file show that the Veteran used over 48 months of Chapter 35 and Chapter 1606 benefits.

The Board is cognizant that, in general, the maximum number of months of entitlement under two or more programs is 48 months (known as the "48-month-rule").  38 U.S.C. §§ 3013 (a)(1), 3312(a), 3695(a).

However, in this case, the Board cannot tell from the existing documents in the claims file, when and how the Veteran used Chapter 35 and Chapter 1606 benefits, as reported in a November 2022 Information Report. As this information is relevant to determining whether the Veteran is entitled to any additional education benefits, remand is required to determine the exact date that the Veteran used Chapter 35 and Chapter 1606 benefits, including any application for benefits, decisions granting entitlement to Chapter 35 or 1606 benefits, enrollment certificates, or any other documents showing when the Veteran used VA educational benefits.

In addition, the Veteran reported that she served on active duty, but the November 2022 Information Report does not show any qualifying active duty periods of service for the Veteran. As this information may be relevant to the Veteran's entitlement to educational benefits, remand is required for the AOJ to verify the nature and dates of the Veteran's service, to include any dates of active duty and reserve duty. 

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a). In this case, the Board does not have before it the evidence necessary to determine whether the AOJ correctly adjudicated the merits of the instant appeal and cannot fulfill its statutory and regulatory requirement to base its decision on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. The Board finds that the AOJ erred in not ensuring that all the necessary evidence was of record for review by the Board and failing to provide the legally required notice. Accordingly, a remand is necessary in this case. 

In addition, the Board is unable to determine based on the record evidence if the notices of decision complied with the content requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including but not limited to a summary of the applicable laws and regulations, identification of findings favorable to the claimant. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify the dates and nature of the Veteran's active duty and reserve service.

2. Determine the exact date that the Veteran used Chapter 35 and Chapter 1606 benefits, and associate copies of any supporting documents, including any application for benefits, decisions granting entitlement to Chapter 35 or Chapter 1606 benefits, enrollment certificates, or any other documents showing when the Veteran used VA educational benefits, with the claims file.
