ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss condition was incurred in or is related to her military service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1985 to April 1988.  

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  

The Veteran contends that she has bilateral hearing loss that is related to his military service. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In cases where a hearing loss disability is claimed, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the above frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt will be given to the appellant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 777-79 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

First, in the March 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney submitted a request for "any and all Compensation and Pension examiner(s) whose opinion(s) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relied on to deny the veteran's claims". The Board notes that "once the request is made for information as to the competency of the examiner, the veteran has the right, absent unusual circumstances, to the curriculum vitae and other information about qualifications of a medical examiner. This is mandated by the VA's duty to assist." See Francway v. Wilkie, 940 F.3d 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2019). 

However, pursuant to the provisions of the AMA, the Board reviews the record only to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). In this case, the evidence window closed with the February 2023 rating decision. The challenge to the VA examiner's competency under Francway was received in March 2023. As the challenge under Francway was received after the rating decision on appeal, the AOJ's failure to provide the VA examiner's qualifications to the Veteran does not represent a pre-decisional duty to assist error. The duty to assist does not attach at the Board level in an AMA appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c). Therefore, remand for that issue is not appropriate, and no further action is warranted.

Additionally, the Board notes that while the Veteran attended VA hearing examinations in October 2020 and June 2022, she missed scheduled examinations in April 2022 and January 2023.

When a claimant fails to participate in a scheduled VA examination, the Board must consider (1) whether the examination was necessary to establish entitlement to the benefit sought, and (2) whether the claimant lacked good cause to miss the scheduled examination. Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 568 (2008). Here, the Veteran and her representative have not challenged the fact that she failed to report for the examinations, did not request that the January 2023 examination be rescheduled, and did not provide good cause. Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the Veteran's failure to appear for an examination was without good cause.

The "duty to assist is not always a one-way street," and the Veteran has an obligation to actively participate in the retrieving of any information pertinent to his claim, to include attending scheduled VA examinations. A veteran is expected to cooperate in the efforts to adjudicate the claim, and the failure to do so subjects him or her to the risk of an adverse adjudication based on an incomplete and underdeveloped record. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991); Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 178 (2005).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board acknowledges the holding in Kyhn v. Shinseki, 716 F.3d 572 (Fed. Cir. 2013), that there is no presumption of regularity in a case in which the notification letter for the scheduling of a VA examination is not of record. In this case, the claims file does not contain a letter notifying the Veteran of the scheduled examinations in April 2022 and January 2023. However, the Board finds that the facts in this case are distinguishable from the facts considered in Kyhn. In Kyhn, the appellant expressly argued that he failed to attend the scheduled VA examination because he was not provided advance notice, whereas, in this case, the Veteran and her representative have not made such an argument.

Given the facts of this case, the Board finds that no further development action is needed. As a result, the Board must decide the issue based on the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

In this regard, under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). In the February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran had an occupation of Radioman and therefore, in-service noise exposure is conceded.

The Board acknowledges that it is unclear whether the Veteran has a hearing loss for VA purposes.

On the authorized audiological evaluation in October 2020, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 35	40	40	40	40

LEFT	 40	45	55	50	55

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 72 percent in the right ear and of 60 percent in the left ear.

On the authorized audiological evaluation in June 2022, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	15	20	20	25

LEFT	20	20	25	20	20

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and of 98 in the left ear. Of note, the June 2022 examiner concluded that the test results were not valid for rating purposes due to them being inconsistent with organic hearing loss. 

Nonetheless, even if the Board finds that the Veteran does have a hearing loss disability for VA purposes, service connection is not warranted in this case. 

The Veteran's service treatment records are absent of any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of hearing loss. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2020. However, the examiner did not provide an etiology opinion. 

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in June 2022. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's hearing loss was not related to service. The examiner explained that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation, which is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise. The examiner explained that recorded hearing levels using calibrated audiometric tests were with a normal hearing entrance assessment and without a significant (>10 dB HL) high frequency in-service permanent threshold shift at .5 - 6kHz bilaterally. The examiner explained that there is no report of complaint/treatment for hearing decrease in STRs or at separation. The examiner explained that although noise exposure is conceded and the relationship of noise, auditory damage and hearing loss is well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss are not conceded based on noise alone. The examiner explained that there must be a nexus of auditory damage to relate current hearing loss to military noise and not another etiology. The examiner stated that the evidence is against a nexus in this case, therefore it is less likely than not that the hearing loss is related to military noise exposure. The examiner noted that hearing loss onset was reported by the Veteran today as 2017, many years post-separation.

The Board finds that the June 2022 VA examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). As such, the Board assigns the opinion great probative value. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that she has bilateral hearing loss that is related to her military service. However, the issue is medically complex. Therefore, it is outside the competence of Veteran in this case because the record does not show that Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the June 2022 VA opinion.

The Board notes that bilateral hearing loss is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331. However, the disability was not shown as chronic in service, did not manifest to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, and was not noted in service with attributable continuity of symptomatology. Instead, the June 2022 VA examination shows that the Veteran reported an onset in 2017, years outside of the applicable presumptive period.  

As such, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and the claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
