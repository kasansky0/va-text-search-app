ORDER

An initial increased evaluation for left knee osteochondroma, degenerative joint disease, evaluated as 10 percent disabling prior to September 8, 2014, and as 20 percent disabling thereafter, is denied.  

A rating in excess of 10 percent for chondromalacia of the right knee is denied.

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Prior to September 8, 2014, the Veteran's left knee osteochondroma, degenerative joint disease, is not shown to be productive of a malunion of the tibia and fibula, ankylosis, flexion functionally limited to 60 degrees, extension functionally limited to 15 degrees, moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, impairment of the semilunar cartilage, or a dislocated meniscus. 

2.  As of September 8, 2014, the Veteran's left knee osteochondroma, degenerative joint disease, is not shown to be productive of a malunion of the tibia and fibula, ankylosis, flexion functionally limited to 60 degrees, extension functionally limited to 20 degrees, moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, impairment of the semilunar cartilage, or a dislocated meniscus.

3.  The Veteran's chondromalacia of the right knee is not shown to be productive of a malunion of the tibia and fibula, ankylosis, flexion functionally limited to 60 degrees or extension functionally limited to 15 degrees, moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, impairment of the semilunar cartilage, or a dislocated meniscus. 

4.  The Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone do not preclude him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.   

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an increased initial evaluation for left knee osteochondroma, degenerative joint disease, evaluated as 10 percent disabling prior to September 8, 2014, and as 20 percent disabling thereafter, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.40, 4.45, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 5003, 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5260, 5261, 5262.

2.  The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for chondromalacia of the right knee have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.40, 4.45, 4.7, 4.71a, DCs 5003, 5256, 5257, 5258, 5259, 5260, 5261, 5262. 

3.  The criteria for a TDIU have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a), (b). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1976 to August 1979.

In March 2010, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a left knee disability.  In January 2011, the RO granted service connection for left knee osteochondroma with degenerative joint disease, evaluated as 10 percent disabling effective February 19, 2010, and denied a TDIU.  The Veteran appealed the increased rating claim and the denial of TDIU.  

In December 2014, the RO granted the increased rating claim for the left knee to the extent that it assigned a 20 percent rating effective September 8, 2014, denied a claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability, and denied a TDIU.  See December 2014 statement of the case.  Since this increase did not constitute a full grant of the benefit sought, the increased rating issue remains in appellate status.  AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993)

In July 2018, the Board remanded the claims.  In September 2020, the Board denied the claims.  

The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and in a June 2021 order, pursuant to a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), the Court vacated the September 2020 decision and remanded the issues back to the Board.  

In March 2022, the Board remanded the claims for additional development in compliance with the JMPR.  In August 2022, a supplemental statement of the case  (SSOC) was issued. Then in September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Review. Thereafter, in November 2022, the RO denied the claims.   

In October 2023, the Veteran filed a decision review request: Board appeal (notice of disagreement) (VA Form 10182), electing for Direct Review Lane, and citing the November 2022 RO decision.  Under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the issuance of the appealed rating decision may be considered; rather, the Board review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 which was then subject to higher level review in the November 15, 2022 rating decision.  

The Veteran was afforded a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in May 2018.  The VLJ who conducted the hearing is no longer employed at the Board.  In February 2022, a letter was sent to the Veteran informing him of right to request an additional Board hearing.  In March 2022, the Veteran's representative waived the Veteran's right to a new hearing.  

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. Therefore, the Board may not consider this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1.  Initial increased rating, left knee osteochondroma, evaluated as 10 percent disabling prior to September 8, 2014, and as 20 percent disabling thereafter.

The Veteran's former representative has argued that separate ratings are warranted for limitation of flexion and extension.  See Veteran's former representative's statement, received in January 2022.  During his hearing held in July 2018, the Veteran testified that he had not received treatment for his knees during the past two to three years because he must stay at home due to kidney surgery.  He reported having knee symptoms that included severe pain, fatigue, swelling, "giving out," and popping and locking, with difficulty using stairs.  He said that he cannot lift heavy weights, "bend too much," or stand for prolonged periods.  He wears braces.   

Service connection is currently in effect for a back disability and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part IV.  If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's left knee disability has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5003 - 5261.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  This hyphenated diagnostic code may be read to indicate that arthritis is the service-connected disorder, and it is rated as if the residual condition is a limitation of extension.  

The Board must determine whether a higher initial evaluation is warranted under any applicable diagnostic code.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Therefore, the following diagnostic codes are relevant:

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5256, ankylosis of the knee with a favorable angle in full extension, or in slight flexion between 0 and 10 degrees, is rated at 30 percent.  This Diagnostic Code 5256 was not changed by the February 7, 2021 amendments, discussed infra.

In Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021), the Court held that the application of §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permits consideration of an evaluation based on ankylosis, if a claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis, that is, if the demonstrated functional loss is the functional equivalent of ankylosis.

Ankylosis is stiffening or fixation of a joint as the result of a disease process, with fibrous or bony union across the joint.  Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996); see also Villareal v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 13 (2001) (defining ankylosis to mean that "a joint is fixed, or 'frozen' in one position").

DC 5260 evaluates the limitation of flexion for the knee.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 45 degrees, a 20 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is assigned for flexion limited to 15 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260.

DC 5261 evaluates the limitation of extension for the knee.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 10 degrees, a 20 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 15 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is assigned for extension limited to 20 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5261.

The normal range of motion (ROM) for the knee is from 140 to 0 degrees for extension and from 0 to 140 for flexion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

For disabilities evaluated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA is required to apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, pertaining to functional impairment.  The Court has instructed that in applying these regulations VA should obtain examinations in which the examiner determined whether the disability was manifested by weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, or pain.  Such inquiry is not to be limited to muscles or nerves.  These determinations are, if feasible, to be expressed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to any weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, flare-ups, or pain.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

Functional loss due to pain is rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592 (1991).

The possible manifestations of functional loss include decreased or abnormal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance (38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40), as well as less or more movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement (as well as swelling, deformity, and atrophy) that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing (38 C.F.R. § 4.45).  Mitchell. 

DC 5257 evaluates recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of the knee.  Under DC 5257 (as in effect prior to February 7, 2021), a 10 percent rating is assigned for slight recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.

The words "slight," "moderate" and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

On February 7, 2021, during the course of this appeal, revisions to the Schedule of Rating Disabilities that addresses the musculoskeletal system went into effect.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held that statutes generally may not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires that result.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  In Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991), the Federal Circuit held that the more favorable regulations should apply to the Veteran.  However, in Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit overruled Karnas to the extent that it allowed for retroactive application and conflicted with U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedents.  Specifically, the Federal Circuit held that the Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise.  Thus, Karnas allows the old criteria to be applied before and after the effective date of the amendment, if such is more favorable to the Veteran. But, in light of Kuzma, the amended regulation cannot be applied prior to the effective date unless it explicitly provides otherwise.  In other words, the old and new regulations are for consideration with regard to rating the Veteran's disability, and he is entitled to the more favorable regulation; however, if the revised criteria are more favorable to the Veteran and provide for an increased rating, that award may not be made effective before the effective date of the change.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); VAOPGCPREC 3-00.  Here, the amendments to the rating schedule do not have any retroactive application.

The revisions do mark the effort by VA to quantify what slight, moderate, and severe mean within the context of knee stability and therefore, the revised regulations can be used to define the terms of 5257 throughout the course of the appeal, even before the effective date of the regulation changes.

The revisions to the regulations do change the language for malunion of the tibia and fibula, and instability and subluxation of the knee.

Under DC 5262 (as in effect prior to February 7, 2021), a 10 percent rating is assigned for malunion of the tibia and fibula, with slight knee or ankle disability, a 20 percent rating is assigned for malunion of the tibia and fibula, with moderate knee or ankle disability, a 30 percent rating is assigned for malunion of the tibia and fibula, with marked knee or ankle disability, and a maximum 40 percent rating is assigned for nonunion of, with loose motion, requiring brace.   

Under Diagnostic Code 5262 (as in effect prior to February 7, 2021) impairment of the tibia and fibula manifested by malunion is to be evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 5256, 5257, 5260, or 5261 and the Diagnostic Code that results in the highest evaluation is to be used.  Additionally, under Diagnostic Code 5262 medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS), or shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, both lower extremities is to be rated 30 percent disabling; requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one lower extremity is to be rated 20 percent disabling; requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment, one or both lower extremities is to be rated 10 percent disabling; and treatment less than 12 consecutive months, one or both lower extremities is to be rated a noncompensable.    

The amended Diagnostic Code 5257 provides two categories for instability of the knee, (1) recurrent subluxation or instability, and (2) patellar instability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257).

For (1), recurrent subluxation or instability due to sprains or ligament tears causing persistent instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there is no prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is a medical provider who prescribes either a brace or an assistive device for ambulation and there is persistent instability from ligament tears or sprains.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when there is a prescription from a medical provider for both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation.  Id.

For (2), patellar instability is defined as a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.  The patellofemoral complex for Code 5257 is defined as consisting of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  A note clarifies that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair to at least one of the patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for this Code.  Id.  For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without a surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following a brace, cane, or walker.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, and either a cane or walker.  Id.  

With regard to instability and subluxation of the knee, the descriptor terms of slight, moderate, and severe have been removed, and replaced with detailed descriptions of levels of impairment resulting from recurrent subluxation or instability, or from patellar instability.  

For the entire time period on appeal, an increased rating for the left knee or the right knee is not warranted under DC 5256 or 5262.  The Veteran is not shown to have left knee or right knee ankylosis, a nonunion of the tibia and fibula, MTSS, or shin splints.  See e.g., VA examination reports dated in October 2010, September 2014, and October 2019.   Accordingly, these Diagnostic Codes will not be further discussed. 

In Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017), the Court held that under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a separate evaluation may be assigned for meniscal problems under DCs 5258 or 5259, even when ratings are in effect under DCs 5257 and 5261.

Diagnostic Codes 5258 and 5259 evaluates a dislocated or removed semilunar cartilage.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for a dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint under Diagnostic Code 5258.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for removal of the semilunar cartilage that is symptomatic under Diagnostic Code 5259.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5258, 5259.  

Use of the conjunctive "and" in a statutory provision means that all of the conditions listed in the provision must be met.  Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (1991).  

For the entire time period on appeal, a separate rating is not warranted for the left knee or the right knee under DCs 5258 or 5259.  The October 2019 DBQ notes a left knee meniscal tear with locking and pain, but no effusion.  See id.; see also May 2022 VA DBQ.  A history of knee surgery and/or a meniscal condition were not noted or found in the July 2009, October 2014, or May 2022 VA DBQs, or in VA progress notes.  There is no evidence of removal of the semilunar cartilage in either knee.  The criteria for a separate rating under DCs 5258 or 5259 have therefore not been met, and these Diagnostic Codes will not be further discussed.  

Prior to September 8, 2014.  

The evidence shows that the Veteran was noted to have left knee extension and flexion as follows: extension to 0 degrees and flexion to 130 degrees (October 2010 VA examination report), extension to 0 degrees and flexion to no less than 120 degrees (VA progress notes).  An initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent is not warranted under DC 5261 as the Veteran's left knee is not shown to have been productive of extension limited to 15 degrees.    

The Board has considered whether an increased rating could be assigned on the basis of functional loss due to the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.  

The October 2010 VA examination report shows that the Veteran reported that he had constant pain.  He also reported stiffness, giving way, daily or more frequent locking, and episodes of dislocation or subluxation.  He complained of moderate weekly flare-ups lasting hours.  This report shows that on examination, there is no deformity, weakness, or incoordination.  An X-ray report notes a large benign osteochondroma and minimal or early degenerative osteophyte formation in the medial compartment without joint space loss.  The diagnoses were left knee osteochondroma and mild degenerative joint disease.     

A February 2011 VA spine examination report notes 4/5 strength of left knee flexion and extension.   

The Board finds that when the ranges of motion in the left knee are considered together with the evidence of functional loss due to left knee pathology, the evidence does not support a conclusion that the loss of motion in the left knee more nearly approximates the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent, even with consideration of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  The VA DBQ shows that there are no incapacitating episodes of arthritis.  The impact on occupational activities was decreased mobility and pain.  There was a severe effect on sports, mild effects on recreation and chores, and no effects on shopping, traveling, dressing, and driving.  The Veteran's degenerative joint disease was characterized as mild.  As such, it is not shown that the range of motion in the Veteran left knee was so functionally limited as to warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5261. 

The Board has considered whether a separate rating is warranted for any left knee symptoms allowed by law.  A separate rating is not warranted for left knee limitation of flexion under DC 5260.  VAOPGCPREC 9-04, 69 Fed. Reg. 59990 (2005).  The recorded ranges of motion for the left knee do not show that the Veteran has been found to have flexion limited to 60 degrees or less.  This remains the case even when the associated findings on functional loss are considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45; DeLuca.  A separate rating for limitation of left knee flexion is therefore not warranted.  

As of September 8, 2014.

The evidence shows that the Veteran was noted to have left knee extension and flexion as follows: extension to 15 degrees and flexion to 90 degrees (September 2014 VA examination report (examination performed September 8, 2014)), extension to 0 degrees and flexion to 110 degrees (during flare-ups) (October 2019 VA DBQ), and extension to 0 degrees and flexion to 70 degrees (May 2022 VA knee and lower leg DBQ).  

A rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted under DC 5261, as the Veteran's left knee has not been productive of extension limited to 20 degrees.    

The Board has considered whether an increased rating could be assigned on the basis of functional loss due to the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain.  

The September 2014 VA DBQ shows that the Veteran complained of daily pain, and locking when ascending stairs, with limitations on walking.  He did not verbalize flare-ups.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional limitations.  The Veteran constantly used a cane and regularly used a brace on his left knee.  Strength of left knee flexion and extension was 4/5.  The examiner endorsed chronic limitation of activities due to pain and associated limitation of motion which the examiner stated was demonstrated in examination.  The examiner further stated although the Veteran's condition would preclude a physical job like that of a mover, his condition would not preclude all employment.  The relevant diagnosis was osteochondroma posterior aspect tibia with degeneration.  

A 2018 MRI was noted to show an asymptomatic, benign osteochondroma.  A 2018 bone imaging study contains an impression of mild increased activity in the left proximal tibia extending, with a suggestion of mild degenerative changes.  

The October 2019 VA DBQ shows that the Veteran reported stiffness, locking, and clicking up the stairs.  He reported "rolling" in his meniscus.  He stated that it also caused him to fall.  He reported flare ups and functional loss due to repeated use over time.  He reported that his knee caused difficulty bending, kneeling, squatting, jogging, running, hiking, jumping, climbing up or down stairs, and prolonged standing or walking.  The examiner noted that the Veteran would be additionally limited by pain during a flare up.  There was no evidence of pain on weight bearing, on passive motion, or when the joint was used in non-weight bearing.  Diagnostic studies showed degenerative arthritis, bilaterally.  The Veteran's bilateral knee disorders affected his ability to work in that he had "difficulty with moderate to heavy manual labor.  Some difficulty with plant, pivot, and shift.  Some difficulty going up or downstairs.  Can perform light manual, office, and sedentary work."  A left knee X-ray report contains an impression of unchanged exostosis at the proximal tibia.  The Veteran regularly used a cane and brace.  There was no pain on passive motion or non-weight bearing.  Strength of left knee flexion and extension was 5/5.  See also October 2019 VA back DBQ (5/5 strength of knee flexion and extension)

The May 2022 VA knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the Veteran complained of flare-ups and functional loss with repeated use over time manifested by pain with standing and walking short distances, walking up and down stairs, and squatting.  There was interference with standing and disturbance of locomotion.   

VA progress notes show treatment for complaints of left knee symptoms that include pain.  They include findings that patellar mobility was within normal limits.  There are notations of left knee derangement, osteochondroma.  Heel-to-toe gait was normal.  Strength was 2+ to 3/5 at the quadriceps and hamstrings, and 3+/5 knee flexion and extension.  

The Board finds that when the ranges of motion in the left knee are considered together with the evidence of functional loss due to left knee pathology, the evidence does not support a conclusion that the loss of motion in the left knee more nearly approximates the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent, even with consideration of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  The evidence has been summarized.  In part, the September 2014 VA DBQ shows that the Veteran did not verbalize flare-ups and that he was able to perform repetitive use testing with no additional limitations.  The October 2019 VA DBQ shows that there was a limitation of functional loss due to flare ups such that flexion was to 110 degrees.  Extension was unchanged at 0 degrees.  There was no additional functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions.  The May 2022 VA DBQ shows that there was no additional functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions.  The evidence does not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination which significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups.  Muscle strength was 5/5 in October 2019 and May 2022.  There is no evidence of muscle atrophy.  As such, it is not shown that the range of motion in the Veteran left knee was so functionally limited as to warrant a rating in excess of 20 percent under DC 5261.  

The Board has considered whether a separate rating is warranted for left knee limitation of flexion.  VAOPGCPREC 9-04.  The recorded ranges of motion for the left knee do not show flexion limited to 60 degrees or less.  This remains the case even when the associated findings on functional loss are considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45; DeLuca.  A separate rating for limitation of left knee flexion is therefore not warranted under DC 5260.  

To the extent that there are findings of reduced ranges of motion in an October 2018 VA progress note, e.g., left knee flexion to 17 degrees and right knee flexion to 40 degrees, these findings are significantly inconsistent with contemporaneous findings and the majority of findings as a whole.  See e.g., findings of flexion to between 86 and 98 degrees with extension to 0 degrees, with a normal heel-to-toe gait and no use of an assistive device in June and July 2018 VA progress notes; ranges of recorded motion in VA DBQs.  This evidence indicates a single flare up that is insufficient to warrant an increased rating.  Madden v. Gober, 125 F. 3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  

For the entire time period on appeal, a separate rating is not warranted for left knee instability.  

An October 2010 VA DBQ notes complaints that included instability, giving way, and locking.  However, the Veteran denied episodes of dislocation or subluxation.  Instability was not found on examination.  There was a finding of patellar abnormality associated with mild dislocation and subluxation.   

A September 2014 VA DBQ shows that that the examiner indicated that there is no history of recurrent patellar subluxation or dislocation.  On examination, there was no evidence of instability, subluxation, or dislocation.  All tested ligaments were normal.  

VA progress notes dated in 2018 note a left knee sprain.  The cruciate ligaments were intact.  There was no instability.  

An October 2019 DBQ shows that there is no history of recurrent subluxation or lateral instability for either knee, and that all tested ligaments in the left knee and the right knee are normal.  See also October 2019 VA progress note (finding of no instability).  

The May 2022 VA DBQ shows that the examiner indicated that there is no history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knees.  On examination, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of either knee, and patellar instability, were not found.   

The evidence is insufficient to show recurrent subluxation or lateral instability of the left knee for the entire period on appeal to warrant a separate rating under DC 5257. 

2.  Rating in excess of 10 percent, chondromalacia of the right knee. 

The Veteran's service treatment reports show that in 1978, he was put on light duty for right knee chondromalacia.  

In August 1980, the RO granted service connection for right knee chondromalacia, evaluated as noncompensable.  In October 2000, following a September 2000 Board decision, the RO increased the Veteran's rating to 10 percent.  In February 1997, the RO denied a claim for an increased rating for a right knee disability.  On June 29, 2005, the Board denied the claim.  The Board's decision was final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (b).  In December 2014, the RO denied a claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a right knee disability.  

The Veteran's right knee disability has been rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5257-5003.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  This hyphenated diagnostic code may be read to indicate that instability is the service-connected disorder, and it is rated as if the residual condition is degenerative arthritis.  

The relevant evidence includes the July 2009 VA examination report for the right knee showing that the examiner determined that there was no giving way, episodes of dislocation or subluxation, or locking episodes.  On examination, there was/were no instability, abnormal tendons or patellar abnormality.  

An October 2010 VA DBQ notes complaints that included instability, giving way, and locking.  However, the Veteran denied episodes of dislocation or subluxation.  Instability was not found on examination.  There was a finding of patellar abnormality associated with mild dislocation and subluxation.   

A September 2014 VA DBQ shows that that the examiner indicated that there was no history of recurrent patellar subluxation or dislocation.  On examination, there was no evidence of instability, subluxation, or dislocation.  All tested ligaments were normal.  

An October 2019 DBQ shows that there was no history of recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, and that all tested ligaments in the right knee were normal.  See also October 2019 VA progress note (finding of no instability).  

The May 2022 VA DBQ shows that the examiner indicated that there was no history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knees.  On examination, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability of either knee, and patellar instability, were not found.   

Based on the evidence, the Veteran does not meet a rating in excess of 10 percent for his right knee for instability as the evidence clearly shows there was no history of instability or recurrent subluxation.  There is certainly no evidence of moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability to warrant a higher rating under the prior rating criteria.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257.  Notably, the Veteran himself denied  giving way, episodes of dislocation or subluxation, or locking episodes. Additionally, while the Veteran used a cane, there is no evidence of persistent instability from ligament tears or sprains; or has a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair to meet the criteria for a higher rating under the revised criteria. 

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran can get additional ratings under other rating codes.  In this regard, the evidence shows that the Veteran was noted to have right knee extension and flexion as follows: extension to zero degrees and flexion to 120 degrees (July 2009 VA joints examination report); extension to 10 degrees and flexion to 90 degrees (September 2014 VA DBQ), extension to 0 degrees and flexion to 110 degrees (during flare-ups) (October 2019 VA DBQ), extension to 0 degrees and flexion to no less than 63 degrees (VA Progress notes dated in 2019), extension to 0 degrees and flexion to 80 degrees (May 2022 VA DBQ).  

Separate/higher ratings are not warranted under DCs 5260 or 5261, as the Veteran's right knee is not shown to have been productive of extension limited beyond 10 degrees for a higher rating or flexion limited to 60 degrees to even meet the criteria for a compensable rating.   

The Board has considered whether an increased rating could be assigned on the basis of functional loss due to the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain.  DeLuca.  The July 2009 VA examination report shows that the Veteran complained of pain, especially when walking upstairs and with changes in the weather.  He denied flare-ups.  He was able to stand for 15 to 30 minutes.  He was able to walk one-quarter of a mile.  He frequently used a cane.  The report notes that he denied any other symptoms, to include locking up, swelling, and weakness.  There was no history of surgery.  On examination, there was no giving way, deformity, stiffness, weakness, incoordination, episodes of dislocation or subluxation, effusions, or locking episodes.  His current limitations on standing up and walking were mainly related to his hip and low back pain, as well as his use of a cane.  On examination, gait was antalgic.  There was no instability, abnormal tendons, or meniscus or patellar abnormality.  There was no objective evidence of pain following repetitive motion.  There was no ankylosis.  There was a moderate impact on chores and exercise, a mild effect on traveling and driving, and no effect on recreation.  The current severity of right knee degenerative arthritis was mild to moderate.  The examiner stated that most of the Veteran's functional impairment at this time was related to his right hip pain and low back pain.  

A February 2011 VA spine examination report notes 4/5 strength of right knee flexion and extension. 

VA progress notes show complaints of right knee pain aggravated by climbing stair, walking long distances, bending down, and lifting.  The Veteran walked with a cane.  Strength was 4/5 in the right lower extremity in 2012.   In 2019, the Veteran's right knee was noted to have 3+/5 strength on flexion and extension. 

The September 2014 VA DBQ shows that extension was not additionally limited  following repetitive-use testing.  Strength on flexion and extension was 5/5.  There was functional loss due to less movement than normal, pain on movement, and swelling.  

The October 2019 VA DBQ shows that strength of right knee flexion and extension was 5/5.  There was no muscle atrophy. 

The May 2022 VA DBQ shows that there was no additional functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions.  The evidence did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination which significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups.  There was interference with standing and disturbance of locomotion.  Muscle strength at the right knee was 5/5.  

The Board finds that when the ranges of motion in the right knee are considered together with the evidence of functional loss due to right knee pathology, the evidence does not support a conclusion that the loss of motion in the right knee more nearly approximates the criteria for a compensable rating even with consideration of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  The evidence has been summarized.  In part, the October 2019 VA DBQ shows that there was a limitation of functional loss due to flare ups such that flexion was to 110 degrees.  Extension was unchanged at 0 degrees.  There was no additional functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions.  The May 2022 VA DBQ shows that there was no additional functional loss or range of motion after three repetitions.  The evidence does not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups or repeated use over time.  The DBQs show that muscle strength was 5/5.  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.  As such, it is not shown that right knee range of motion was so functionally limited as to warrant compensable ratings under DCs 5260 or 5261.  

The Board has considered the Veteran's assertions of knee instability.  The Veteran is competent to report his right knee symptoms, as these observations come to him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his symptoms are of such severity as to warrant an increased rating.  The evidence as to the lack of instability was summarized supra.  The VA DBQs show that the Veteran's statements were considered and evaluated along with the clinical findings, which do not show instability.  The Board therefore finds that the medical findings, which directly address the criteria under which the disabilities are evaluated, are more probative than the Veteran's assertions as to the severity of his disabilities.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

3.  TDIU.

In 2010, the Veteran asserted that he is unemployable due to his back condition.  See VA Form 21-4138 received in June 2010.  The Veteran's former representative has argued that the Veteran last performed substantially gainful employment in approximately 1992-93.  See Veteran's former representative's statement, received in January 2022.  

A 1994 TDIU claim (VA Form 21-8940) shows that the Veteran indicated that he last worked full-time (40 hours a week) as an electrician in April 1992.   The Veteran indicated that he had 12 years of schooling.  He indicated that he did not leave his last job due to disability.  An August 2010 TDIU claim (VA Form 21-8940) shows that the Veteran indicated that he worked full-time as a train operator from September 1980 to October 1988, followed by full-time work as an electrician from February 1990 to April 1992.  He indicated that he earned between $2,080 and $3,167 a month, and that he did not leave his last job due to disability.  

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id.

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  Id.  The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment.  Id.  Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity).  Id.

"[U]nable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a) comprises both economic and noneconomic components, which required consideration of a wide range of factors, and one is a veteran's ability to perform sedentary activities.  Id. at 73 (also holding that Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations defining "sedentary" are not binding on VA).  

Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139, 148 (2018) held that while 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 "does not make the concept of sedentary work an explicit TDIU factor" if TDIU is denied because "a veteran is capable of sedentary work" this must be explained in the context of that case."  Thus, while not a legally governing consideration, the ability to perform sedentary work can be a relevant factor and a finding that sedentary employment is possible can be determinative when explained in relation to past education and occupational history.  See id.  However, neither VA nor the Court has explicitly defined the term "sedentary employment."  Withers, 30 Vet. App. at 148.

The Board finds that sedentary employment is the common meaning in society of non-physical, white collar, office-type work.  Non-physical employment encompasses administrative, managerial or other forms of employment that would not require the Veteran to spend a significant amount of time standing, ambulating or performing physical activity requiring lifting, bending, walking, or standing for long periods of time, and which would permit the Veteran to take periodic breaks.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training.  See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Substantially gainful employment" is that employment that "is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihoods with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides."  Moore (Robert) v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  Marginal employment will not be considered substantially gainful employment."  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

As of February 2010, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities were: right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy, evaluated as 40 percent disabling; lumbosacral strain with degenerative disc disease, degenerative arthritis, and herniated nucleus pulposus, evaluated as 20 percent disabling; left knee osteochondroma with degenerative joint disease, evaluated as 10 percent disabling, and right knee chondromalacia, evaluated as 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran's combined rating was 70 percent.  The Veteran is therefore shown to have met the schedular criteria for TDIU based upon two or more service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

While Social Security Administration decisions regarding unemployability are clearly relevant and should be weighed and evaluated, they are not controlling with respect to VA determinations.  Odiorne v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 456, 461 (1992). 

A September 1995 decision of the Social Security Administration (SSA) shows that the Veteran was determined to be disabled as of July 1993.  He was noted to have a primary diagnosis of disorders of the back, and a secondary diagnosis of osteoarthrosis and allied disorders.   

VA VR&E (vocational rehabilitation and employment) reports note that the Veteran was placed on discontinued status in June 2010 for failure to complete an evaluation.  An associated 2010 functional capacity evaluation (FCE) shows that it was concluded that the Veteran demonstrated the ability to perform at a sedentary to light PDC (presumably: physical demand characteristics of work).  He is limited with squatting, kneeling, ladder climbing, and stooping.  His diagnosis was DJD.   

An October 2010 VA knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the impact on the Veteran's occupational activities was decreased mobility and pain.  

A February 2011 VA spine examination report shows that the examiner concluded that the effect and resulting work problems due to the Veteran's back disability was increased absenteeism.  

A September 2014 VA knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the examiner concluded that the Veteran's bilateral knee conditions would preclude a physical job like "mover."  The examiner stated that the Veteran's knee conditions would not preclude employment.

An October 2019 knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the impact on the ability to perform occupational tasks was that the Veteran has difficulty with moderate to heavy manual labor.  "Some difficulty with plant, pivot, and shift.  Some difficulty going up or downstairs.  Can perform light manual, office, and sedentary work."  

An October 2019 back DBQ shows that the examiner concluded that the Veteran's back disability did not impact his ability to work.  

A May 2022 VA knee and lower leg DBQ shows that the impact on the Veteran's occupational activities was that he was precluded from physical labor that required prolonged standing, walking, or lifting.  

The Board finds that the Veteran is not shown to be unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities.  While the Veteran clearly has some limitations due to his service-connected disabilities, a disability rating itself is recognition that industrial capabilities are impaired.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).  In reaching a determination of TDIU, it is necessary that the record reflect some factor which takes a claimant's case outside the norm with respect to a similar level of disability under the rating schedule.  Id.  In this case, no such factor is shown.  The Veteran appears to have completed high school and to have work experience as a train operator and an electrician.  The SSA determined that the Veteran was disabled as of 1993 due to his back disability with a secondary diagnosis of osteoarthrosis and allied disorders.  The SSA's decision is dated almost 30 years ago, in September 1995, and it warrants little probative value as it was issued many years prior to the time period on appeal.  Boggs v. West, 11 Vet. App. 334, 344 (1998).  Five VA opinions are of record spanning a period of about 12 years (between 2010 and 2022) which indicate that the Veteran can work.  These opinions include an examiner who stated that the Veteran can perform "light manual, office, and sedentary work," an examiner stated that the Veteran's ability to work was precluded to the extent that he cannot perform a physical job like "mover," and a VR&E employee who determined that the Veteran has the ability to perform sedentary work and light work.  Another examiner concluded that the Veteran can work as long as the job does not require physical labor with prolonged standing, walking, or lifting.  No examiner has concluded that the Veteran has a decrease in functioning due to his service-connected disabilities which precludes employment.  There is no competent opinion of record in support of the claim.  With regard to the opinions indicating that the Veteran can perform sedentary or light work, the Veteran's limitations due to his back and lower extremities have been discussed.  There is no evidence to show impairment of the upper extremities or upper body due to service-connected disability which would preclude employment.   

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence of record is insufficient to show that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of his service-connected disabilities.  

While the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have resulted in occupational impairment, the competent and probative evidence does not show that the Veteran was unable to perform non-marginal employment.  Accordingly, the criteria for a TDIU are not shown to have been met and the claim is denied.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).              

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against the matters of whether the criteria for increased ratings for the left knee or the right knee have been met, and whether the Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities.  Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
