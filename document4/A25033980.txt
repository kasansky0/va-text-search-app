DOCKET NO. 240918-482396
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal regarding the appellant's eligibility to the direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in a July 2024 rating decision granting entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) and Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In November 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this case, and based upon an updated October 2024 Fee Decision granting direct payment of 20 percent of fees from past due benefits awarded in a July 2024 rating decision, the appellant withdrew his appeal of the initial July 2024 Fee Decision denying payment of fees.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the dismissal of the present appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from January 1979 to December 1993; the appellant is his former VA representative.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2024 VA Fee Decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) regarding a July 2024 rating decision granting a TDIU and SMC.  As this was an initial fee determination, the contested claims procedures of the Appeals Modernization Act apply.  The Board notes that although these required procedures have not yet been completed, as the appeal is being dismissed for lack of a dispute of law or fact, no prejudice arises from proceeding with a decision at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400-20.405.

In June 2022, the appellant filed valid VA Form 21-22a appointing him as the Veteran's representative before VA as well as a duly signed fee agreement stipulating the payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded.  The appellant subsequently filed a December 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim on the Veteran's behalf, seeking a TDIU and listing a December 2022 Higher Level Review decision that identified a duty to assist error in a prior rating decision's adjudication of the issue of TDIU.  This claim correctly noted that the issue of TDIU had yet to be readjudicated and therefore was still pending Higher Level Review; the AOJ later issued an October 2023 Higher Level Review decision denying TDIU.

After further development based on the December 2023 Supplemental Claim, the AOJ issued a July 2024 rating decision granting entitlement to a TDIU and SMC from the date of receipt of the December 2023 claim.  Internal VA documents indicate this resulted in $13,852.72 in past due benefits being awarded to the Veteran.  In the resulting Fee Decision on appeal, the AOJ found that the criteria for the direct payment of fees to the appellant had been met but listed the amount of fees to be paid as $0.00.  The appellant filed a timely VA Form 10182 Board Appeal disputing this amount, and while the case was pending before the Board the AOJ issued a replacement October 2024 Fee Decision regarding the July 2024 rating decision.  This decision determined that the appellant was entitled to direct payment of fees in the amount of 20 percent of the $13,852.72 in past due benefits.

Based on the replacement Fee Decision, the appellant submitted November 2024 correspondence identifying the present appeal and indicating his satisfaction with the new determination as well as his desire to withdraw his appeal.  Internal VA documents confirm that fees in the amount of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded in the July 2024 rating decision (minus fees) were disbursed to the appellant in December 2024.  This, combined with the appellant's desire to withdraw the appeal, leave no remaining disputes of law or fact to adjudicate.   

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  As the underlying dispute has been resolved and there remain no allegations of error of law or fact for appellate consideration, the appeal is dismissed.  Id.
