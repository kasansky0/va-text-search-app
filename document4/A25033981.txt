DOCKET NO. 231012-384132
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is granted based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.	The Veteran died by suicide in November 2020.

2.	At the time of the Veteran's death, he had been diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (see October 2020 private medical records), and it is not in question that his depression was the cause of his death.

3.	The Veteran served honorably in support of multiple combat tours overseas (including Operation Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Noble Eagle) during his nearly six years of active service, and the resulting guilt he experienced as a result of being away from his family during that time.

4.	The Veteran's spouse provided competent (that is, qualified) and credible reports that her late husband, the Veteran, would discuss his military service when he was depressed and that it was the circumstances of his service, along with his feelings of guilt about being away from his family during that time, that was the cause of his depression; the Veteran's son provided similar competent (that is, qualified) and credible reports; there is no evidence suggesting the Veteran's depression (which caused his death by suicide) had any cause other than his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1310, 5107(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.312 (2021).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from December 1990 to December 1994, September 2001 to September 2002, and March 2003 to August 2003. See DD-214s.  He also had significant Air Force Reserve service.  He was awarded an Air Force Reserve Force Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Air Force Achievement Medal, among numerous others.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) is granted based on service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.

For the reasons noted above, the appeal is granted.
