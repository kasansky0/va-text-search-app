FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The June 2022 appointment of the appellant as the Veteran's agent and the associated fee agreement are valid.

2. In a January 25, 2023, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for cranial nerve V neuralgia, left side (claimed as nerve damage of face) with an evaluation of 10 percent, effective June 24, 2022; service connection for cranial nerve VII neuralgia, left side (claimed as nerve damage of face) with an evaluation of 10 percent, effective June 24, 2022, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 25, 2023, rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2010 to August 2015.      

The appellant, Michael C. Kiser, is an accredited VA claims agent, and Veteran's current representative.  

The case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 Summary of the Case (fee decision).

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 fee decision on appeal, and a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the NOD if received within 30 days of the notice of the content of the NOD. 38?C.F.R. §§?20.400-20.405.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

The record reflects both the Veteran and appellant were mailed copies of the AMA Initial and Final Notification Letters dated August 2023 and September 2023.

Issue: Whether the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a January 25, 2023,  rating decision. 

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).  Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); see also Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28, 32-34 (2023).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

In Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (Federal Circuit) held that agents and attorneys are eligible to receive fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision has been under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (b), and thereby invalidating the regulatory provision of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i). 7 F.4th 1110, 1135-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Federal Circuit explained that while § 5104C(b) supplemental claims may have a different effective date and duty to notify than § 5104C(a) supplemental claims, see §§ 5110(a)(3), 5103(a)(3), such distinctions should matter in the context of charging attorneys' fees. Id. at 1139.  The Court expressly rejected the government's argument that a § 5104C(b) supplemental claim filed more than a year after a prior decision is not part of the same "case" as that earlier decision, thereby barring attorneys from charging fees for any work on such claims until the supplemental claim itself is rejected. Id. at 1138.

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

Analysis

In June 2022, the Veteran and the appellant executed a VA Form 21-22a and fee agreement, which provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of any past due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the 20 percent was to be paid directly to the appellant by VA.  The Board finds that the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his agent, and the associated fee agreement, are valid. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).

Earlier, in a February 2016 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for status post mandibular injury with residuals of pain and functional limitation (claimed as jaw injury). 

In September 2022, the Veteran, through his agent, submitted a supplemental claim for service connection for nerve damage of face. See Forms VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim. 

By rating decision dated January 9, 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for cranial nerve IX, V, VII, XII neuralgia, right side (claimed as status post mandibular injury with residuals of pain and functional limitation), effective June 24, 2022.  In that same decision, the AOJ indicated a decision on the entitlement to compensation for cranial nerve V, VII neuralgia, left side (claimed as status post mandibular injury with residuals of pain and functional limitation) was deferred. 

In a January 10, 2023, Summary of the Case, the AOJ found the appellant eligible to fees and withheld $787.25 for fees, which is 20 percent of past-due benefits.  The appellant does not dispute this fee decision. 

Subsequently, by rating decision dated January 25, 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for cranial nerve V and VII neuralgia, left side (claimed as nerve damage of face) with an evaluation of 10 percent each, effective June 24, 2022, from which the past-due benefits awarded are contested.

In a January 26, 2023, Summary of the Case (fee decision on appeal), the AOJ indicated that fees could not be directly paid to the agent.

Here, the Board finds basic eligibility to fees based on the January 25, 2023, grant of past-due benefits is warranted.  As the Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his agent, and the associated fee agreement, are valid, this case turns on whether the appellant is eligible to receive fees stemming from the September 2022 supplemental claim seeking service connection for service connection for nerve damage of face, which was granted in the January 25, 2023, rating decision. 

To that end, the Federal Circuit directly addressed this question in holding that attorneys are eligible to fees pursuant to supplemental claims filed more than one year after a decision has been under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (b) and thereby invalidating the regulatory provision of?38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i). See Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7 F.4th at 1135-41.  

Accordingly, even though the September 2022 supplemental claim was submitted more than one year after the last final denial of service connection for status post mandibular injury with residuals of pain and functional limitation, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 2023 rating decision, which granted service connection for cranial nerve V and VII neuralgia, left side, with an evaluation of 10 percent each, effective June 24, 2022.  

Thus, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in the January 25, 2023, rating decision and the appeal is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.
