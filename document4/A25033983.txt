ORDER

Eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a March 2021 Rating Decision is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. In August 2014, the claimant and the appellant executed and filed a valid fee agreement and VA Form 21-22.

2. A Notice of Disagreement (NOD) was filed in August 2014 with the March 2014 denial of a rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD.

4. In a March 2021 Rating Decision implementing a March 2021 Board decision, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) awarded a rating of 70 percent for PTSD from January 28, 2011, a rating of TDIU from January 28, 2011, and establishing basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) from January 28, 2011.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in a March 2021 Rating Decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from May 1989 to October 2000, with foreign service including in Southwest Asia, Somalia, and Rwanda.

This matter was previously before the Board in December 2021, at which time it denied the issue on appeal. The appellant appealed this denial to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In July 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), vacating the Board's prior decision and remanding the claim for further development. Specifically, the Court remanded for the Board to seek clarification as to whether the appellant intended to seek review under the Direct Review or Evidence Submission docket.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56,64-65 (2023).  The Court also remanded to consider whether the appellant's fee agreement was timely filed under the "mailbox rule" presumptions of 20 C.F.R. § 20.110(a).  Letters noticing the Veteran and the appellant of the Court's JMR were mailed to each party in July 2024.

Having now considered this issue, the Board finds that there has been substantial compliance with the Court's remand directives.  Specifically, the record reflects that while the Veteran's original VA Form 10182 included a selection of the Direct Review docket, he intended to select the Evidence Submission docket.  Furthermore, the relevant evidence of record now reviewable indicates that the appellant submitted his July 2014 Fee Agreement well within 30 days of execution.  This finding renders moot any discussion of the mailbox rule.

The fee decision on appeal was issued in March 2021 and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. On a timely May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), the appellant challenged the March 2021 fee decision.

The appellant selected the Direct docket. However, the appellant referred to evidence submitted with his May 2021 VA Form 10182.  As the appellant's submission was ambiguous, per Edwards v. McDonough, supra, the Court issued its July 2024 JMR.  The appellant thus submitted another VA Form 10182 in October 2024 resolving the ambiguity in his submission and selecting the Evidence docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the May 2021 VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  

Attorney Representation and Fees

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904. A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA.

Agents and attorneys may charge claimants or appellants for representation provided: After an AOJ has issued a decision on a claim or claims, including any claim to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (a) or for an increase in rate of a benefit; the AOJ issued notice of that decision before the effective date of the modernized review system; an NOD has been filed with respect to that decision on or after June 20, 2007; and the agent or attorney has complied with the power of attorney requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 and the fee agreement requirements in 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g). All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. Fee agreements must be valid and, as is relevant here, must state the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3).  

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

Entitlement to attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in a March 2021 Rating Decision

The appellant, the claimant's attorney, asserts entitlement to the 20 percent fee stipulated in his agreement with the claimant.  The Board finds that the appellant is entitled to the direct payment of fees

As an initial matter, in July 2014, the appellant signed VA Form 21-22a, Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative and a fee agreement stating that the attorney's fee to be paid will be 20 percent of past-due benefits, paid directly to the attorney by VA. The Board finds the agreement to be valid, as it was properly filed with VA and contains all required information in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g).  Notably, an August 7, 2014 fax memorandum submitted in May 2021 with the Veteran's substantive appeal indicates that the fee agreement was submitted within 30 days of its July 11, 2014 execution.   

Next, the appellant is eligible to direct payment of fees. Specifically, service connection for PTSD was granted in a January 2003 Rating Decision, with a 30 percent rating.  A rating in excess of 30 percent was denied in AOJ decisions dated April 2013 and March 2014.  A Notice of Disagreement (NOD) was filed in August 2014 as to the March 2014 denial of a rating in excess of 30 percent for PTSD.  After an April 2017 Substantive Appeal, the Veteran was granted a rating increase to 50 percent effective September 12, 2016, in a February 2018 SSOC.  This SSOC was appealed to the Board in March 2018 and as a result of a March 2021 Board decision, in the March 2021 Rating Decision mentioned above, the AOJ granted a 70 percent rating effective January 28, 2011.  In a March 2021 Summary of the Case, the AOJ found that the criteria for direct payment of fees were not met.

In his Form 10182, the appellant argued that he should be eligible for the direct payment of fees because he submitted his July 2014 Fee Agreement within 30 days, as required.   

Based on a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the appellant is, as he claims, eligible for the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the March 2021 Rating Decision. Specifically, the decision resulting in a grant of benefits was decided under the Legacy system. A Notice of Disagreement was filed on the claim after June 20, 2007, and the VA Form 21-22a and July 2014 Fee Agreement were valid and timely filed with VA. Therefore, the appellant is eligible for the direct payment of attorney fees.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
