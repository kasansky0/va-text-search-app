REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for thoracolumbar spine disorder, to include degenerative arthritis, degenerative joint disease (DJD), and degenerative disc disease (DDD), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to February 1968. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued on March 4, 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. See Rating Decision (March 2024). The AMA automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).

On January 19, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim for service connection for thoracolumbar spine disability.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the January 19, 2023, supplemental claim rating decision.  In March 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal continuing the denial of service connection for thoracolumbar spine disability, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the January 19, 2023, supplemental decision. 

In February 2025, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), selecting the Direct Review docket and waiving his right to modify his docket selection. See VA Form 10182 (February 2025). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 19, 2023, rating decision that was the subject of the March 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the January 19, 2023, rating decision the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a notice of disagreement and change Board dockets by submitting a new notice of disagreement within one year of notification of the decision on appeal or within 60 days of the date that the Board received the original notice of disagreement, whichever is later. Here, although the Veteran's time to select a docket other than Direct Review has not yet elapsed, the Veteran, through his attorney, waived the right to change dockets. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). See also VA Form 10182 (February 2025) and Third Party Correspondence (February 2025). Thus, the Board may proceed to adjudicate the claim.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand. Thus, the Veteran should not presume that the Board has found his report of injury credible or not credible at this time. See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249 (2020). See also, Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332 (2020).

Entitlement to service connection for thoracolumbar spine disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his thoracolumbar spine disorder stems from an in-service injury when heavy shelves containing canned goods fell on top of him, causing injury to his low back. See C&P Exam (October 2021). Alternatively, he contends that his thoracolumbar spine disorder is secondary to service-connected right ankle disability. See VA Form 21-4138 (April 2004).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reflect no complaint or abnormal pathology of the back, and no documented injury to the back to include from falling shelves. Further, the Veteran's December 1967 Report of Medical History (ROMH) at service separation reflects that he denied a history of having or having had recurrent back pain as well as injury other than noted-no injury to the back was noted or the alleged by the Veteran. The December 1967 Report of Medical Examination (ROME) reflects normal clinical evaluation of the spine, other musculoskeletal. See STR - Medical (September 1970).

VA received the Veteran's original VA disability claim in August 1967, but it did not include any back claim or report of injury from fallen shelving. See VA Form 21-526 (August 1970).

Treatment records dated between 1988 and 1996 reflect musculoskeletal complaints/findings (e.g. ankle, elbow), but no back complaints or findings. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (MTR) (August 1988); MTR (December 1996). A January 1997 VA joint examination reflects that the Veteran provided a medical history that, for example, included borderline hypertension and borderline diabetes, and right leg pain; but there were no complaints pertaining to the back or report of any history of injury from falling shelves in service. See VA Examination (January 1997). However, at another VA joints examination in May 2001, the Veteran reported ankle injury due to injury sustained in 1968 "when he was stacking some objects on a shelf and then the shelf gave way. See VA Examination (May 2001).

The first documented indication of a back problem comes in April 2004 correspondence from the Veteran indicating his service connected ankle disability was "creating a back condition." See VA Form 21-4138 (April 2004). A February 2004 VA imaging study reflect finding for degenerative changes of low back. An August 2016 statement from the Veteran reflect his report of back injury from metal shelves with large cans that collapsed on him; and that immediately after he had lower back pain. See VA 21-4138 (June 2016).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for thoracolumbar spine disorder is remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the January 19, 2023, supplemental claim rating decision.

VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate). 

First, prior to the January 2023 decision, AOJ obtained an October 2021 Back Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire and medical opinion. See C&P Exam (October 2021). The medical opinion reflects that the Veteran's diagnosed thoracolumbar conditions are less likely than not related to in-service injury.  The rationale was that:

the Veteran have a diagnosis of (a) back condition that is less likely as not (50 percent or greater probability) incurred in or caused by (the) medical onset during service.  The STR is silent for back pain.

The Board finds the October 2021 medical opinion is inadequate because the essential rationale for that opinion is not discernable. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). First, the opinion notes that the Veteran's STRs are silent for a low back pain, however, service connection may be established for any disease diagnosed after service discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Second, it does not reflect a meaningful discussion of the Veteran's lay statements. See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016) ("the VA examiner's failure to consider [a veteran's] testimony when formulating her opinion renders that opinion inadequate").

Second, also prior to the January 2023 decision, the AOJ obtain a December 2022 medical opinion. See C&P Exam (December 2022). The medical opinion reflects that the Veteran's diagnosed thoracolumbar conditions are less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected right ankle disability. However, the clinician improperly applied the standard of proximate causation. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding all that is needed is "but for" causation or aggravation to show entitlement to secondary service connection). In Spicer, the Federal Circuit held that "the but-for causation standard is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links" and is "undisputedly broader" than proximate causation. Additionally, the medical opinion does not address the aggravation prong of secondary service connection. Therefore, the December 2022 opinion is inadequate. See El Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (indicating that findings of "not due to," "not caused by," and "not related to" a service-connected disability are insufficient to address the question of aggravation under § 3.310(b)).

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist errors on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the January 2023 rating decision, which was subject to HLR review in the March 2024 HLR rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Veteran is reminded that VA's duty to assist is a two-way street.  If the Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential to establishing his claim.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). Thus, the Veteran is encouraged to provide copies of relevant treatment records, or authorize release to VA, for consideration is addressing his claim.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician addressing the etiology of the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disorder. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal. 

The clinician must opine on:

Direct Service Connection

FOR THE PURPOSE OF AN OPINION ONLY PRESUME THAT THE ALLEGED BACK INJURY OCCURRED WHEN A METAL SHELF OR SHELVES COLLPASED: 

(a.) Whether the Veteran has a thoracolumbar spine disorder, to include degenerative arthritis, DJD, and DDD, that is at least as likely as not due to or a result of the Veteran's report of in-service injury described as heavy shelves with canned goods falling on him. Explain.

(b.) Do the Veteran's reports about his injury and symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability are known to develop or are the appellant's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?  Explain.

Consider: (1) the Veteran's December 1967 Report of Medical History (ROMH) at service separation reflects that he denied a history of having or having had recurrent back pain as well as injury other than noted-no injury to the back was noted or the alleged by the Veteran; (2) the December 1967 Report of Medical Examination showing normal clinical evaluation of the spine, other musculoskeletal; (3) Post service treatment records to include the February 2004 imaging study showing degenerative changes at all lumbar levels and SI joint. 

Secondary Service Connection

(c.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disorder, to include degenerative arthritis, DJD, and DDD, is caused by or the result of service-connected right ankle disability. Explain.

(d.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's thoracolumbar spine disorder, to include degenerative arthritis, DJD, and DDD, is aggravated by service-connected right ankle disability. Explain.

NOTE (1): Aggravation exists even if there is only an incremental increase in disability or where there is any additional impairment of earning capacity in nonservice-connected disabilities resulting from service-connected disabilities above the degree of disability existing before the increase regardless of its permanence. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233, 239 (2019).

NOTE (2): Aggravation exists even where "the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability." See Spicer, 61 F.4th 1364.
