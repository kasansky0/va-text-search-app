ORDER

Eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in rating decisions, dated May 12, 2023, and August 30, 2023, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his representative and the associated fee agreement are valid.

2. In a July 2021 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), inter alia, denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected contact dermatitis and tinea versicolor (skin conditions).  This denial was continued in an April 2022 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision.

3. In January 2023, a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, was filed seeking readjudication of, inter alia, the April 2022 HLR decision's denial of a rating in excess of 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected skin conditions, including entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU).

4. In a rating decision dated May 12, 2023, the rating for the Veteran's service-connected skin conditions was increased from 30 percent to 60 percent, resulting in an award of past-due benefits.

5. In a rating decision dated August 30, 2023, a TDIU was awarded, effective January 27, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in rating decisions, dated May 12, 2023, and August 30, 2023, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Fee Decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

In a December 2023 VA Form 10182, the appellant requested review of the October 2023 Fee Decision under the Board's direct review docket.  Under direct review, a Board decision is based on the evidence at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record in its direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Accordingly, the Board may only consider evidence of record as of October 25, 2023, the date of the decision on appeal.

Procedural Requirements

As an initial matter, the Board notes that a claim for attorney fees constitutes a contested claim and, therefore, is subject to special procedural requirements.  See Mason v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 1 (2012).

Specifically, under applicable criteria, upon the filing of a notice of disagreement (NOD) in a contested claim, all interested parties are to be furnished a copy of the substance of the NOD, including the type of review requested.  38 C.F.R. § 20.403.  Thereafter, the non-appealing party has 30 days within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.404.

Here, in a January 2024 correspondence, the Veteran was notified that the appellant had submitted a VA Form 10182 regarding entitlement to attorney fees, that the appellant had requested review under the Board's direct review docket, and notified the Veteran of the 30-day window within which to file a brief, argument, or request a different type of review.  The Veteran was also provided a redacted copy of the December 2023 VA Form 10182.  See January 2024 Board Correspondence.

Therefore, the Board finds that the procedural requirements with regards to contested claims have been met, and the Board may proceed with adjudication of this appeal.

Analysis

Eligibility for attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in rating decisions, dated May 12, 2023, and August 30, 2023, is granted.

The appellant seeks attorney fees for representation provided in conjunction with a May 12, 2023, rating decision's award of a 60 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected skin conditions, and an August 30, 2023, rating decision's award of a TDIU, resulting in awards of past-due benefits to the Veteran.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  To represent a claimant before VA, a representative must execute a power of attorney, on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative."

Agents or attorneys may charge claimants fees for representation once: (a) the agent or attorney has complied with regulatory power of attorney (POA) and fee agreement requirements; and (b) an AOJ has issued notice of an initial decision on a claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.631, 14.636.

In other words, agents or attorneys are eligible for the payment of fees, based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded in a decision, only if there is a valid POA and Fee Agreement AND the decision which awarded the past-due benefits was the result of a valid appeal.  Notably, when such a decision is issued in response to a supplemental claim, the payment of fees is warranted so long as the supplemental claim is seeking the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis as the original claim.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Vet. Aff., 7 F4th 1110, 1138 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Here, the appellant complied with the regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements.  Specifically, the appellant and the Veteran submitted a valid VA Form 21-22a in September 2021.  See September 2021 VA Form 21-22a.  Additionally, a Fee Agreement was submitted in September 2021, providing for direct payment of 20 percent of past-due benefits.  See September 2021 Fee Agreement.  As such, the first element to establish eligibility for attorney fees has been met.

The remaining question is whether the AOJ had issued an initial decision on the claim.  In other words, this matter turns on whether the issues of entitlement to a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected skin conditions and entitlement to a TDIU were on appeal at the time of the May 12, 2023, and August 30, 2023, rating decisions, respectively.

With respect to the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected skin condition, the record reflects that such issue was initially denied in a July 2021 rating decision and that the denial was continued in an April 2022 HLR decision.  Thereafter, in a January 2023 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran sought readjudication of, inter alia, the April 2022 HLR decision's denial of such issue.  The May 12, 2023, rating decision was issued in response to the January 2023 Supplemental Claim.

With respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the August 30, 2023, rating decision states that it was issued in response to a new claim for benefits received in January 2023.  Additionally, the record shows that the issue had not been adjudicated prior to such rating decision.

However, when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal of an assigned disability rating, a claim for entitlement to a TDIU will be considered to have been raised by the record as "part and parcel" of the underlying claim.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009).

Here, in the January 2023 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran appealed, inter alia, the rating assigned for his service-connected skin conditions, specifically asking for a higher rating, to include a TDIU.  Additionally, accompanying the January 2023 Supplemental Claim was a VA Form 21-8940, Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  Indeed, the May 12, 2023, rating decision, which was issued in response to the January 2023 Supplemental Claim, deferred the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, thereby implicitly acknowledging that the issue had been raised by the record and was part of the appeal stemming from the January 2023 Supplemental Claim.

Given the above, the Board finds that, as the January 2023 Supplemental Claim resulted in the May 12, 2023, and August 30, 2023, rating decisions, which granted a 60 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected skin conditions, and a TDIU, respectively, the attorney fees specified in the Fee Agreement are warranted and the claim is granted.
