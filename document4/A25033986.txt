ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for erectile dysfunction (ED) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran currently is assigned the maximum schedular rating available for ED.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable disability rating for ED have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1997 to July 2017. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granting entitlement to service connection for ED with a noncompensable initial disability rating, and granting special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, both effective August 19, 2022. The January 2024 rating decision came after an August 2023 rating decision found a duty to assist error in an April 2023 rating decision denying service connection for a penile condition. 

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). The Veteran elected the direct review docket. As this is an AMA appeal on the direct review docket, and the rating decision on appeal came after a higher-level review found a duty to assist error in the April 2023 rating decision, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the January 2024 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

An appeal of a decision by the AOJ consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board in accordance with the provisions of 30 C.F.R. §§ 20.202-.204. 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. A claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (b).

Within the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed claims that were addressed in April 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions. Notices of the April 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions were mailed on April 18, 2023, and August 15, 2023, respectively. Therefore, the Veteran had until April 18, 2024, and August 15, 2024, respectively, to file a Notice of Disagreement as to the issues decided in these rating decisions. No communication was received from the Veteran regarding the issues he now attempts to appeal until his October 2024 Notice of Disagreement. In short, the Veteran's appeal was not received within one year of those decisions, nor is there any evidence that he requested an extension of time to submit an appeal. Therefore, the Board will not address those claims. The Veteran is free to file a supplemental claim for those disabilities.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function, will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for ED is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his service-connected ED. The Veteran currently is in receipt of a noncompensable disability rating for ED pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522.

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). The rating criteria for ED were revised effective November 14, 2021. The Veteran's claim for service connection for a penile condition, ultimately granted as for ED, was received on August 19, 2022, subsequent to the November 14, 2021, amendment of DC 7522. Therefore, only the current version of DC 7522 is applicable.

Under DC 7522, ED is evaluated with a noncompensable evaluation with or without penile deformity. A note to DC 7522 states that, for the purpose of VA disability evaluation, a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity shall be rated under diagnostic code 7522. A footnote to DC 7522 also indicates that the disability is to be reviewed for entitlement to SMC for loss of use of a creative organ under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a).

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran already is in receipt of SMC for his service-connected ED based upon the loss of use of a creative organ. Therefore, the issue of entitlement to SMC is not presently before the Board.

In November 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA male reproductive organ examination. After a review of the Veteran's records and an in-person examination of the Veteran, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with, in relevant part, ED. The Veteran reported difficulty in achieving and maintaining erections 100 percent of the time. The VA examiner attributed the Veteran's ED to his use of the psychiatric medication Lamotrigine. Per the Veteran's request, the Veteran's penis, testes, and epididymis were not examined. November 2023 VA ED Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's ED is not warranted. The Board notes that although the Veteran has clearly been diagnosed with ED, he has not had a penile deformity at any time during the appeal period. Further, a noncompensable rating, with or without penile deformity, is the only schedular rating available under DC 7522. Thus, a compensable disability rating is not available.

For the reasons above, the Board finds that a compensable rating for ED is not warranted. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
