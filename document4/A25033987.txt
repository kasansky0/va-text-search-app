ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 5, 2022, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss disability is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is in approximate equipoise as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus had onset during his period of active-duty service.

2. In an August 2019 decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's service-connection claim for a bilateral hearing loss disability.  The Veteran did not request review of that determination with the AOJ or the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) within one year of notice of the August 2019 rating decision.  

3. On November 5, 2022, VA received correspondence indicating an intent to file a claim for compensation.  Within one year, on May 18, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.

4. In the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ awarded service connection for bilateral hearing loss and made the award effective November 5, 2022.

5. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's hearing loss has manifested in no worse than Level I hearing acuity in the left ear and Level I hearing acuity in the right ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for the award of service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date earlier than November 5, 2022, for the award of service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c), (h). 

3. The criteria for a compensable evaluation (in excess of 0 percent) for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1977 to July 1980.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the November 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's service-connection claim for a bilateral hearing loss disability, and assigned an initial noncompensable (zero percent) rating, effective November 5, 2022.  In the same decision, the AOJ also denied entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that, on his VA Form 10182, the Veteran listed "bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus" as the issues he desired to appeal to the Board.  As the AOJ granted the Veteran's service-connection claim for hearing loss in the November 2023 rating decision, the Board construes the Veteran's December 2023 disagreement to be with the assigned initial rating and effective date of the award.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The Veteran reported experiencing hearing loss and tinnitus, with onset during his period of active-duty service.  See the Veteran's May 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation.  He attributed both his hearing loss and his tinnitus to exposure to in-service noise from weapons fire and airplane noise in performance of his duties as an infantryman in the Army.  See id.; see also the Veteran's DD Form 214.  In the above-referenced November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ specifically awarded service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability based on a November 2023 audiologist's medical opinion that such was indeed related to "acoustic trauma from military noise."

The probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has tinnitus.  Indeed, an August 2019 VA examiner acknowledged and accepted the Veteran's report of recurrent tinnitus, experienced for many years, of gradual onset.  A prior July 10, 2017, VA treatment report also documented the Veteran's report of having occasional ringing in the ears throughout the day.  Although a more recent November 2023 examiner was of the opinion that the Veteran did not have tinnitus (but instead transient ear noise unrelated to noise-exposure) the examiner did not reconcile this conclusion with prior evidence (both lay and medical) which identified the presence of the disability.  Moreover, the AOJ had already accepted as a favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with tinnitus, and the Board is bound by that favorable finding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

Tinnitus is a subjective condition which is capable of lay observation, and the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, to include when he first noticed such symptoms. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (2007). The Board finds no reason to call into question the Veteran's report of first noticing tinnitus during his period of active-duty service, as he stated on his May 2019 claims form.

Considering the unique facts of this case, the Board finds this evidence to be sufficient to establish that the Veteran's tinnitus disability at least as likely as not had in-service onset.  Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the benefit sought is granted on this basis.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 5, 2022, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection based on an initial or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments are effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Under the former regulations, any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies the benefit sought.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014).

By way of background, on April 22, 2019, the Veteran filed both an intent to file and a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting, among other things, entitlement to service connection for a hearing loss disability.  The AOJ sent the Veteran a letter in response to the intent to file, and the Veteran filed another VA Form 21-526EZ on May 20, 2019, requesting the same benefit.  

There is no formal or informal communication from the Veteran, or from any prior representative, pre-dating the Veteran's April 2019 claim that shows an intent to file a service-connection claim for hearing loss, and the Veteran does not report that he filed any such claim with VA prior to April 2019.

In an August 2019 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's service-connection claim for hearing loss.  The Veteran did not exercise any options for review under the AMA within one year of receiving notice of that decision.

On November 5, 2022, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for compensation.  Within one year, on May 18, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability, and made the award effective the date of receipt of the November 5, 2022, intent to file.

The Veteran has disagreed with the assigned effective date for the award of service connection, but has not offered any contentions in support of the appeal.  As noted above, neither the Veteran nor his representative has identified or contended that the Veteran filed a service-connection claim for a bilateral hearing loss disability with VA prior to November 5, 2022, that has remained pending and unadjudicated, such that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection could be warranted on that basis.  

In addition, the Veteran did not continuously pursue his April 2019 hearing loss claim, after receiving notice of the August 2019 rating decision denying the claim. Indeed, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, as in this case, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).  

The Board is cognizant of the fact that in between the August 2019 rating decision and the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ solicited and obtained additional service treatment and personnel records that were not on file prior to the AOJ's August 2019 rating decision.  See a September 28, 2023, request for records, and an October 2023 response containing service records.  

Except as otherwise provided, if, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records, that existed but were not associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).  An award made based all or in part on records identified in § 3.156(c)(1) is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date which VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).

Notably, in order to be "relevant" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), the service department records must speak to a matter at issue, in other words, a matter in dispute.  See Kisor v. McDonough, 995 F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

The only matter in dispute at the time the AOJ obtained the additional service records was whether the Veteran's current hearing loss disability was related to in-service noise exposure.  Indeed, in its August 2019 rating decision, the AOJ had already accepted both that the Veteran had a current hearing loss disability, and that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as an infantryman indicated a high probability of noise exposure.  

The Board has reviewed the added service records and finds that they largely contain documents that are duplicative or cumulative of what was already on file prior to the August 2019 rating decision, or are otherwise not relevant to the Veteran's hearing loss claim.  Although the newly added records include an audiogram dated January 22, 1977, the correlating numerical results of that audiogram were transcribed onto the Veteran's January 22, 1977, Report of Medical Examination which was of record prior to the August 2019 rating decision.  Although the added personnel records include a Record of Assignments showing the Veteran's duties as a rifleman, the AOJ had already favorably found that the Veteran was exposed to loud noise from weapons fire during service in its August 2019 rating decision.  The newly added service records also include a Report of Medical Examination dated December 16, 1981; however, it does not include any actual hearing test results.  

The added service records do include a December 16, 1981, Report of Medical History upon which the Veteran denied experiencing hearing loss.  While such is arguably relevant to the question of nexus to service, it is not a record upon which an award of service connection for hearing loss would be based (as contemplated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3)), as it is essentially a statement against the Veteran's own claim.  In fact, in providing a positive medical nexus opinion linking the Veteran's hearing loss to service, it appears the November 2023 examiner accepted the Veteran's current report of decreased hearing acuity during active service in 1980, notwithstanding the Veteran's prior 1981 denial of the same.  Accordingly, an effective date earlier than November 5, 2022, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's hearing loss disability is not available under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

After considering the evidence outlined above, the Board finds that November 5, 2022, is the earliest effective date available under VA's laws and regulations for the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability.  The appeal for the assignment of an earlier effective date is accordingly denied.  

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected hearing loss disability is denied.  

The Veteran's service-connected hearing loss disability is currently rated noncompensable under Diagnostic Code 6100.  He disagrees with this assigned initial rating.  

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz).  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.  

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral.  Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

Prior to the period on appeal, the Veteran appeared for an examination scheduled by VA in August 2019.  At the examination, the Veteran reported difficulty hearing the television and some conversation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

)

Aug. 2019	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	20	20	35	40	29	100%

LEFT	20	20	30	40	28	96%

Applying these results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level I in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level I for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

The Veteran subsequently appeared for another examination scheduled by VA in November 2023.  At the examination, the Veteran reported having difficulty hearing the television, as well as speakers at meetings.  He also noted that he misunderstands words.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:  

Nov. 2023	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	30	40	40	34	100%

LEFT	30	35	40	45	38	94%

Applying these results to Table VI, the findings yield a numeric designation of Level I in the right ear and Level I in the left ear.  Entering the resulting bilateral numeric designation of Level I for the right ear and Level I for the left ear to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII, equates to a noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating under Diagnostic Code 6100.  Again, an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 was not shown.

The Veteran did not undergo another audiological assessment during the period under review.

Based on the evidence above, a compensable disability rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of diminished hearing acuity, and the impact his hearing loss has on his daily life and work.  While the Board in no way minimizes these observations and impacts, it reiterates that disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

In addition, the rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing.  Accordingly, the functional impact that the Veteran describes (i.e., trouble hearing the television, conversation with others, and speakers at meetings) is contemplated by the rating criteria.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).  Indeed, the Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what is contemplated in the rating assigned.  See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).  In the future, should the Veteran notice his hearing acuity worsen, he is invited to file another claim with VA.  

In sum, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a compensable initial rating for the Veteran's hearing loss disability.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
