REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1969 to May 1971.

This appeal stems from an August 2024 rating decision. Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for left foot gout (claimed as bilateral gout in feet) is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left index finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for left little finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for left middle finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for left ring finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

6. Entitlement to service connection for left thumb gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

7. Entitlement to service connection for right foot gout (claimed as bilateral gout in feet) is denied.

8. Entitlement to service connection for right index finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

9. Entitlement to service connection for right middle finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

10. Entitlement to service connection for right ring finger gout (claimed as bilateral gout in hand) is denied.

The Veteran appeals the AOJ's denial of entitlement to service connection for left foot gout, left index finger gout, left little finger gout, left middle finger gout, left ring finger gout, left thumb gout, right foot gout, right index finger gout, right middle finger gout, and right ring finger gout disabilities.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury, which is the "nexus" element. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for gout.

The Veteran's October 2022 VA Form 21-525EZ claims entitlement to service connection for bilateral gout in his hands and feet. He did not assert a specific in-service exposure, event or injury, and he did not explain how he believed that the gout disabilities are related to service.

In a December 2003 memorandum, the AOJ determined that the Veteran was exposed to toxic smoke, grease, oils, and liquids, including chemical cleaning solvents, during his active service.

A January 2024 hand and fingers disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) states that the Veteran started getting pain and swelling in his fingers in 1999. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with gout in both hands.

A February 2024 foot conditions DBQ states that the Veteran has gout in both feet. The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that his symptoms had their onset in 1999.

In a series of February 2024 medical opinion DBQs, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's gout disabilities are not likely due to his in-service exposure to toxic smoke, grease, oils liquids, and chemicals in cleaning solvents. The examiner reasoned that medical studies do not support a connection between these exposures and gout. The examiner opined that the lack of studies makes it reasonable to conclude that they are not related, even after considering all the Veteran's potential exposures.

The AOJ favorably determined that the Veteran has current left foot gout, left index finger gout, left little finger gout, left middle finger gout, left ring finger gout, left thumb gout, right foot gout, right index finger gout, right middle finger gout, and right ring finger gout disabilities. It also determined that the Veteran was exposed to toxic smoke, grease, oils, and liquids, including chemical cleaning solvents, during his active service. These findings bind the Board because they are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

The Veteran has not asserted a discernable theory of entitlement to service connection, and the record does not raise the theory that his gout arose in service because the Veteran reported that his symptoms began in 1999. He also has not alleged that his gout disabilities are due to an in-service injury. However, the AOJ favorably determined that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). Therefore, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's current gout disabilities are due to his TERA.

The Board finds that the February 2024 medical opinions are highly probative on this issue. The examiner reasoned that because there is no literature or other evidence indicating that the Veteran's TERA can cause gout, it is reasonable to assume that his gout is not due to his TERA. The Board finds that this rationale is understandable, well-reasoned, and adequate to fully inform the Board. There is no contrary evidence. Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's current gout disabilities are related to his TERA.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims of entitlement to service connection for left foot gout, left index finger gout, left little finger gout, left middle finger gout, left ring finger gout, left thumb gout, right foot gout, right index finger gout, right middle finger gout, and right ring finger gout disabilities, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeals are denied.
