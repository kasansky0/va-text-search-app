FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed allergy-related disorder, e.g., allergic rhinitis.

2. The evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed right or left arm disorder.

3. The evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed right ankle disorder.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for allergies have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.380. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left arm pain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right ankle pain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right arm pain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

As a member of a State Air National Guard (ANG), the Veteran had active-duty training from January 1991 to August 1991. Afterwards, he was a member of the Reserve where he had periods of active and inactive duty for training.

The Veteran appealed a November 2023 rating decision via the Direct Review Lane, and the appeal was duly docketed at the Board. See 11/29/2023 Rating Decision; 12/13/2023 VA Form 10182; 12/21/2023 BVA Docketing Letter.

Evidentiary Record

As explained on the VA Form 10182, when adjudicating an appeal in the Direct Review docket, the Board's decision must be based on the evidence already of record as of the date the November 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board has not considered any evidence submitted after that date may still be considered if the Veteran resubmits it with a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995). 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the resubmitted evidence, any other new evidence, and the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). In the absence of a currently diagnosed disorder, symptoms may also reach the level of a disability if they caused impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim, even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim for disability or death benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

When adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  

Specifically, the Board gives veterans the benefit of the doubt on any material issue when the positive and negative evidence concerning that issue are approximately balanced or nearly equal. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Therefore, unless the totality of the evidence persuasively weighs against a claim, the Board finds in favor of the veteran. Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-1379 (2023); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364-1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

1. Entitlement to service connection for allergies is denied.

In addition to the general requirements noted above, seasonal and other allergic manifestations subsiding when allergen are absent or removed generally are regarded as acute (versus chronic) diseases, healing without residuals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.380.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect any complaints, diagnoses, treatments, or entries related to allergies ENT problems. To the contrary, the Veteran indicated multiple times he had no allergies, no hay fever, and no sinusitis. See November 1996 STRs. 

Moreover, four years after he separated from service, he affirmatively denied any history of ENT issues, and he was assessed as "normal" for ENT issues. See id. P. 39, 41. Additionally, the Veteran's VA outpatient records currently do not reflect any allergic disorder in his Problem List. The only reference to an allergy in any of the Veteran's records pertains to a reaction to adhesives on bandages and tape following surgery.  See September 2021 CAPRI record.

Thus, the Board finds there is no evidence in the record indicating the Veteran has been diagnosed with an allergy disability, nor is there evidence suggesting the Veteran has an allergy that rises to the level of a disability for VA disability compensation purposes.  A threshold requirement for service connection is the existence of the claimed disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. See also, e.g., Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992), Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.  

In sum, the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the claimed disability exists. Therefore, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

It is important to consider, however, that this denial provides finality as to the appeal, but not necessarily as to the underlying claim, because the claim will be readjudicated by the AOJ if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim along with new and relevant evidence. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A) and (B) (while a veteran may not pursue both a Board appeal and a supplemental claim simultaneously, there is no prohibition on doing so in succession); 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501 (the AOJ will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is submitted with a supplemental claim). In this case, examples of new and relevant may include a diagnosis and nexus opinion from a qualified medical professional, or more detailed descriptions of the Veteran's symptoms and their functional impact.

Additionally, the Board observes if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim within one year of this decision, that claim will constitute "continuous pursuit" of the issue, and therefore the date of his original claim, not the new supplemental claim, will apply for purposes of determining the effective date of any award of benefits based on the readjudication.; 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2024) (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).

2. Entitlement to service connection for left arm and right arm pain is denied.

May 1991 entries in the STRs note the Veteran's complaints of swelling of his left upper extremity (LUE) after lifting weights. Left elbow effusion was noted. At his presentation at an emergency room, his left forearm was 33 cm, and the right, 31 cm. Two days later, the left forearm measured 31 cm, and the right 27, cm. The initial provisional diagnoses were possible inflammation 	and triceps hematoma. X-rays were negative for a fracture. See 11/25/1996 STR-Medical, P. 20, 23, 29, 31. A venogram performed under anesthesia was negative for a deep venous thrombosis. Id. P. 55, 85. The November 1995 RME noted earlier reflects that the Veteran's UEs were assessed as normal. Id. P. 39.

The AOJ arranged an examination to assist the Veteran. The Elbow and Arm DBQ (11/26/2023 C&P Exam, 1st Entry) reflects that the examiner reviewed the claim file and noted the Veteran's lay reported history as part of the examination. The examiner noted the Veteran to report that he sustained a left elbow injury during his active service, and he denied any injury to his shoulder or upper arm. Hence, the examiner completed a DBQ for the elbow and arm. Id. P. 3. 

The Veteran reported that he injured his left elbow carrying equipment; he was hospitalized; the extremity swelled to the size of a grapefruit; and a venogram was performed on the left elbow. Id. The Veteran reported occasional swelling of the left elbow if he is very active, and occasional right elbow pain. Id.  

On examination, the right and the left elbow manifested with normal range of motion without evidence of pain in any plane, or crepitus. Id. P. 5-8. The examiner did not indicate any other evidence of abnormality, such as swelling or other deformity, to include any evidence of muscle atrophy. Id. P. 12, 13. The examiner noted that since the objective findings on clinical examination did not reveal any abnormality, no diagnosis was entered. Id. P. 2, 17; see also 11/26/2023 C&P Exam, 2nd Entry.

The Veteran's representative asserts that the VA examination was inadequate, since the Veteran's records reflect complaints related to his claimed disorders, but the examiner did not enter a diagnosis. See 12/13/2023 Correspondence. The Board rejects the assertion. The Board notes that the examiner opined that there was no current left or right elbow disorder to diagnose based on the clinical findings of an objective medical examination. Hence, the Board finds that the examiner had a factual basis for her opinion. 

Further, the Board notes that the Veteran did not complain of chronic symptoms. The Board notes further that a July 1991 entry in the Veteran's service dental records notes that he reported the May 1991 left elbow injury, but he denied current problems in July 1991. See 11/25/1996 STR-Dental, P. 11. 

As noted above, the Veteran's VA outpatient records do not reflect any elbow issue in his Problem List, and that even after years in the Reserve, a November 1995 examination report and medical history did not indicate any elbow involvement. Thus, the Board finds there is no evidence in the record indicating the Veteran has been diagnosed with an allergy disability, nor is there evidence suggesting the Veteran has an allergy that rises to the level of a disability for VA disability compensation purposes.  A threshold requirement for service connection is the existence of the claimed disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. See also, e.g., Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992), Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.  

In sum, the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the claimed disability exists. Therefore, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

As discussed in the preceding section, this denial does not preclude submission of a supplemental claim that may result in readjudication, and, potentially, a grant of this claim.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle pain is denied.

The Board notes that the Veteran was not afforded an examination in conjunction with the adjudication of this claim. Nonetheless, the Board finds no pre-decision error, as an examination was not triggered.

When determining whether VA is required to provide a VA medical examination or a medical opinion, the following factors should be considered: (1) whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in-service, or evidence establishing certain chronic diseases were manifested during an applicable post-service presumptive period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). 

The third factor has a low threshold and requires only that the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between the current disability or symptoms and a veteran's service. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

All of the above factors must be present to trigger an examination, and the Board finds that not all are present. First, the Board notes that other than listing the right ankle on his claim formal claim, he does not assert any specific in-service event that may have resulted in a current right ankle disorder. A March 2019 entry in his VA outpatient records note his report of a history of ankle/knee pain and bone spurs. No assessment or diagnosis is noted. See 10/16/2020 CAPRI, P. 71; and an August 2023 entry in his VA outpatient records notes that an MRI examination related to another issue showed an old ankle injury that the Veteran called old active-duty pain. See 11/11/2023 CAPRI, P. 36. An April 1992 letter from M. J. R., M.D., an orthopedist, notes that he was treating the Veteran for a right ankle fracture, and he asked that the Veteran be excused from NG physical activities for 2 months. Dr. R's letter does not indicate that the fracture was in any way related to the Veteran's ANG involvement. See 11/25/STR-Medical, P. 45. 

Also, the Veteran's personnel records reflect that he performed a paid 2-day inactive duty tour from March 7-8, 1992; and a 2-day special tour from March 20-21, 1992. See 10/01/2018 Military Personnel Records (MPR), 3rd Entry, P. 7. Nonetheless, there are no indications in the STRs or MPRs, e.g., a Profile or Line of Duty Report, that the Veteran sustained an injury during a training activity. 

Hence, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively shows that the low threshold for an examination was not triggered. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). 

The Board finds further that the evidence is also persuasively against a currently diagnosed right ankle disorder. As concerns his noted complaint of pain, there is no evidence of a diagnosis of chronic pain at the time of his separation, or that right ankle pain impaired his earning capacity. See Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356.

?

Since the evidence of record is persuasively against the claim, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79. The appeal is denied. But, as with the other issues addressed in this decision, a supplemental claim and additional evidence ultimately may enable the VA to grant this claim.
