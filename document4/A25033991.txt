REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lupus anticoagulant syndrome is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1988 to December 1988, November 1990 to April 1991, July 1991 to September 1991 and November 1991 to November 1995. 

This matter is before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal of a February 2024 higher-level review rating decision. In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

REMAND

As an initial matter, service connection for lupus anticoagulant syndrome was initially awarded in an October 2020 rating decision and the Veteran was notified of that decision on November 2, 2020.  On November 4, 2021, the Veteran's attorney submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested an increased rating for lupus anticoagulant syndrome. With the Supplemental Claim, the Veteran's attorney requested an "exemption to timely filing based on hardship caused by the COVID-19 national emergency" because the attorney lived in Puerto Rico, which was under a government-mandated 24 hour a day, 7 days per week lock down, causing issues with communication between the attorney and the Veteran. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b), the Board may accept a late submission if good cause is shown for the delay. Due to the novelty of the COVID-19 virus and the complications regarding travel at that time, and the fact that the claim was received only 2 days after the deadline, the Board finds good cause has been provided, and the November 4, 2021, supplemental claim is accepted as timely to the October 2020 decision. Therefore, this appeal concerns entitlement to a higher initial rating from December 11, 2019.

A November 5, 2021, VA treatment record references treatment of lupus anticoagulant disorder by Dr. K.Z. and states that records were received from Dr. K.Z.'s office which were "placed in outside records folder." Additionally, an August 23, 2023, VA treatment record references "outside records from East Jefferson Hospital," which pertain to treatment for the Veteran's lupus anticoagulant syndrome as recently as November 5, 2021. Those records do not appear to be associated with the claims file. 

Treatment records from Dr. K.Z. were obtained in December 2019, but the November 5, 2021, VA treatment record suggests that more recent records are outstanding. No records from Jefferson Hospital are available for review. Failure to conduct appropriate development to obtain relevant, outstanding records from Dr. K.Z and Jefferson Hospital was a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the records from Dr. K.Z. that are referenced in the November 5, 2021, VA treatment record as well as the records from East Jefferson Hospital referenced in the August 23, 2023, VA treatment record. 

If the AOJ cannot locate such records, it must document the attempts that were made to locate them and explain in writing why further attempts to locate or obtain them would be futile. The AOJ must then: (a) notify the claimant of the specific records that it is unable to obtain; (b) explain the efforts VA has made to obtain that evidence; and (c) describe any further action it will take with respect to the claim. The claimant must then be given an opportunity to respond.

2. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for any additional outstanding, relevant records from Dr. K.Z., and East Jefferson Hospital. Make two requests for any authorized records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
