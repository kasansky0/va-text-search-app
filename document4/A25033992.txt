ORDER

Entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's disability compensation in excess of $200 per child is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was reasonably discharging his responsibilities to his dependents with his wage garnishment and the $200 per child per month apportionment.  The appellant has not demonstrated hardship when considering these payments.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's disability compensation in excess of $200 per child have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5307; 38 C.F.R. § 3.450, 3.451, 3.452, 3.453, 3.458, 3.503, 3.667.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2004 to March 2010.  The appellant, K.G., is the mother of the parties' two children, M.G. and S.G., on whose behalf apportionment was awarded.  

The apportionment decision on appeal was issued in August 2022 under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  The decision awarded an apportionment of $200 per month per child, effective September 1, 2022. 

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Because this is a contested claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the party who did not file the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) if received within 30 days of the December 9, 2024, notice of the content of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400 20.405.

This case involves a simultaneously contested claim; therefore, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105A are applicable. Cases involving simultaneously contested claims are also subject to special procedural regulations. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400, 20.401, 20.402, 20.403, 20.404, 20.405, 20.406, 20.407. Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 20.400 provides that, in a simultaneously contested claim, all interested parties are to be notified of the action taken by the AOJ and of the right and time limit for initiating an appeal, as well as notification of the right to a hearing and representation. Upon the filing of a notice of disagreement, all interested parties will be furnished a copy of the substance of the notice of disagreement, including what type of review was selected and whether a hearing was requested. 38 C.F.R. § 20.403.

The foregoing procedures were satisfied by letters dated in September 2021, August 2022, December 2024, and January 2025.

Evidence was added to the claims file following the August 2022 decision on appeal.  Regulation 38 CFR 20.1105 specifically prohibits contested claimants from filing supplemental claims.  Only new claims on a VA Form 21-0788, Information Regarding Apportionment of Beneficiary's Award are permitted.

Entitlement to an apportionment of the Veteran's disability compensation in excess of $200 per child.

The appellant appeals the apportionment award of $200 per child.  She seeks a higher amount. She has not stated what amount she is seeking.

To determine whether the appellant is entitled to an additional amount of apportionment, the Board reviews the laws and regulations governing apportionment.

All or any part of the compensation payable on account of any Veteran may be apportioned if the Veteran is not residing with his spouse or children, and the Veteran is not reasonably discharging his responsibility for the spouse's or children's support.? 38 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.450?(a)(1)(ii).  Under this provision, no apportionment will be made where the Veteran is providing for his dependents. ?38 C.F.R. § 3.450(c).  It is not necessary for the claimant to establish the existence of hardship in order to obtain an apportionment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.450.  See Hall v. Brown,?5 Vet. App. 294?(1993). This is called a "general" apportionment.

A second type of apportionment, called a "special"?apportionment, is available without regard to any other provision regarding?apportionment. Where hardship is shown to exist, compensation may be specially apportioned between the Veteran and his dependents on the basis of the facts of the individual case as long as it does not cause undue hardship to the other persons in interest.  In determining the basis for special?apportionment, consideration is to be given to such factors as the amount of VA benefits payable, other income and resources of the Veteran and those dependents in whose behalf the?apportionment?is claimed, and the special needs of the Veteran, his dependents, and the apportionment claimants.  The amount apportioned should generally be consistent with the total number of dependents involved.  Ordinarily,?apportionment?of more than 50 percent of the Veteran's benefits would constitute undue hardship on him or her, while apportionment of less than 20 percent of his or her benefits would not provide a reasonable amount for any apportionee. ?38 C.F.R. § 3.451.? A veteran cannot prevail on a claim of hardship when he or she is receiving additional benefit for a dependent and the apportioned amount is no more than that additional benefit.  See Hall, 5 Vet. App. at 295. 

Both types of?apportionments?(either "general" or "special" apportionment) are payable to a spouse or a dependent.? 38 U.S.C. § 5307(a)(2);?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.450?(a)(1)(ii), 3.451. 

The "benefit-of-the-doubt rule" rule does not apply in apportionment cases because it is impossible to give the benefit of the doubt to a veteran and a claimant simultaneously.  Elias v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 259 (1997). 

The term "child of the veteran" means an unmarried person who is under the age of 18 years; or, who after reaching the age of 18 years and until completion of education or training (but not after reaching the age of 23 years) is pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution. ?38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A);?38 C.F.R. § 3.57.  Compensation may be paid from a child's 18th birthday based upon school attendance if the child was at that time pursing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution and a claim for such benefits is filed within 1 year from the child's 18th birthday. ?38 C.F.R. § 3.667. 

In general, VA will accept, for the purpose of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; and, where the claimant's dependent child does not reside with the claimant, the name and address of the person who has custody of the child. In addition, a claimant must provide the social security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is seeking benefits.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.204(a)(1).

The Board must determine whether the amount of apportionment is appropriate to either satisfy the reasonable discharge of the Veteran's responsibilities to his dependents or to remove the appellant from any hardship, all while not creating a hardship to the Veteran.  

The evidence shows that, in August 2021, the state court awarded child support of $1410 per month, allocated as $881 for the youngest child and $529 for the older child.  Support was due beginning August 1, 2021.

State child support statements through January 2022 show that the Veteran's payment of the child support was sporadic, largely through wage garnishment, and ranged from approximately $204 in May 2021 to $2,536 in November 2021.  The most recent month shown on the statement, January 2022, shows the Veteran's wages were garnished in the amount of approximately $750.

The appellant argued in an October 2021 statement that the Veteran was $70,000 in arrears and that he was facing contempt charges and jail time.  

The Board emphasizes that apportionment is not a means of strict enforcement of state court orders.  Apportionment standards are different than state court standards.  In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran has reasonably been discharging his responsibilities to his dependent children.  Although the amount he was paying through wage garnishment does not equal the state court child support order, he was contributing a reasonable amount nonetheless, which evidence shows was no less than $204 per month, but averaged more than that..

The appellant submitted an August 2022 VA Form 21-0788, Information Regarding Apportionment of Beneficiary's Award.  She reported having $2,500 in income and $2,830 in expenses.  She submitted pay statements showing pay of $1,437 for one two-week period and $1,575 for another two-week period.  Thus, in a month's time, her gross salary is $ 3,012.  Her net pay was $1,240 and $1,346 for those respective periods, totalling approximately $2,500, as she reported.  With apportionment of $400, her income barely exceeded her expenses.  With the additional, sporadic child support, her income was at least $200 greater than her expenses, and in many cases, more than that.

The Veteran submitted a February 2022 statement that he has been paying child support via wage garnishment.  He reported that M.G. was no longer living with the appellant and had not been since September 2021.  The Veteran reported he was looking for an apartment for the two of them, and apportionment would prevent that. 

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a statement of hardship, noting that his auto insurance policy was about to lapse.  He submitted statements from creditors, including the auto insurance company, showing past due bills and an overdrawn account.

In June 2022, he submitted a VA Form 21-0788, Information Regarding Apportionment of Beneficiary's Award in which he reported $800 in wages and $2,533 in VA disability, for a total income of $3,333.  His expenses totaled $3,075.  He reported that he was contributing $2,000 per month to M.G. and S.G.  It is unclear to the Board how the Veteran arrived at this figure, because the child support statements do not corroborate it.  Nonetheless, when the $400 per month apportionment is included in his expenses, his expenses exceed his income.  Further, still, the $800 in wages has been garnished to some extent, at least $200 per month.

VA disability records show that as of December 2020, the Veteran had been awarded $3,525 in disability compensation and $3,733, as of December 2021.  This is over $1,000 more than the Veteran reported in income in his VA Form 21-0788.  Thus, the Veteran's income exceeded his expenses by $850 with apportionment considered and $650 or less for an estimated garnishment on the wages.

On the whole, however, as discussed above, the Board finds the Veteran was reasonably discharging his responsibilities to his dependents via the wage garnishment, and even more so with the $400 per month apportionment.  With the wage garnishment and apportionment, the appellant has not shown hardship.  For that reason, any additional apportionment is not warranted.
