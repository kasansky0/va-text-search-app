ORDER

Service connection for vertigo is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) with residual scars is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding a diagnosis of vertigo or vertigo-type symptoms causing impairment in earning capacity at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for vertigo have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1966 to September 1970, with additional service in the Navy Reserve.

A September 2020 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for BCC and vertigo. The Veteran perfected appeals of the claims. A Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) hearing was held in January 2023. The hearing transcript is associated with the claims file. In May 2023, the Board remanded the claims to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), finding duty to assist errors prior to the September 2020 rating decision. A July 2024 rating decision again denied service connection for BCC and vertigo. A September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) appealed and elected the hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in December 2024. The hearing transcript is associated with the claims file. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the December 2024 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) proximately caused by or (b) proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc).

Service connection for vertigo

The Veteran contends entitlement to service connection for vertigo. 

The Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding a diagnosis of vertigo at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Board considered Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity." Id. at 1367-69. The Board does not find vertigo-type symptoms reaching the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

Looking to the evidence, in response to the May 2023 Board remand, a June 2023 VA letter requested the Veteran complete and return a VA Form 21-4142a, General Release for Medical Provider Information, so VA could obtain treatment records on behalf of the Veteran. The Veteran elected to submit the treatment records himself. 

The Veteran submitted treatment records from Dr. J.M., his primary care doctor, dating from 2018 to 2023. There was no mention of vertigo, syncope, or dizziness in the treatment records. At an October 2018 treatment visit to establish care, he was assessed with obesity, coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, psoriasis, and possible thyroid nodule. At a November 2018 treatment visit, he was assessed with diabetes, psoriasis, thyroid nodule, enlarged prostate, and sleep apnea. At a March 2019 treatment visit, he was assessed with possible dermafibroma, CAD, and weight loss. At a May 2019 treatment visit, he was assessed with keratoacanthoma, right forearm squamous, hypertension (HTN), diabetes, thyroid nodules, and sensory neuropathy. At a June 2019 treatment visit, he was assessed with diabetes, thyroid nodules, BCC, and psoriasis. At an October 2019 treatment visit, he was assessed with right lower extremity hamstring and calf discomfort. At an April 2021 treatment visit, he was assessed with osteoarthritis of knees, diabetes, and CAD. At an October 2021 treatment visit, he was assessed with diabetes, osteoarthritis, and thyroid nodules. At a June 2022 treatment visit, seeking medical clearance for a transurethral resection, he was assessed with possible benign prostatic hyperplasia and ureteral stenosis. At a November 2022 treatment visit, he was assessed with COVID. At a January 2023 treatment visit, he was assessed with diabetes and HTN. The doctor included a note stating the Veteran has history of type II diabetes, which has directly affected his CAD, ED, and HTN. At a March 2023 treatment visit, the Veteran was assessed with cervicalgia. At a May 2023 treatment visit, he was assessed with HTN. At a November 2023 treatment visit, he was assessed with HTN, CAD, diabetes, partial Achilles tear, and bilateral medial knee pain.

The Veteran additionally submitted treatment records from Shore Cardiology from 2017 to 2021. A December 2017 echocardiogram report and head CT report noted a history of syncope. Treatment visits in January 2019, August 2019, March 2020, September 2020, November 2020, June 2021, and November 2021 were silent for mention of vertigo, syncope, or dizziness. These treatment records specifically denied dizziness and syncope. The treatment records assessed CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OSA, diabetes, PCI, and obesity. A July 2022 treatment summary printout noted a history of syncope, described as "went to ER following bladder surgery when he was emptying urine catheter and was bending over and passed out, thought to be vagal in nature." An August 2022 stress test report noted a clinical history of syncope. The test impression was normal. February 2023 and September 2023 treatment summary printouts listed the diagnoses of CAD, arteriosclerotic heart disease, HTN, hyperlipidemia, OSA, diabetes, PCI, and obesity.

At a January 2023 Board hearing, the Veteran reported dizziness since the 80s or 90s. He reported dizziness occurred a couple times a month. He thought it may be related to his blood pressure. He said doctors told him it may be related to blood pressure or diabetes.

At a December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran reported vertigo since the 80s. He reported noticing it when he was in the Reserves, described as feeling lightheaded and dizzy, almost losing his balance. He reported passing out 3 or 4 times total, to include an episode that year at the supermarket. He reported his primary care doctor said it may be linked to hypertension, diabetes, or his heart. 

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding a diagnosis of vertigo or vertigo-type symptoms reaching the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

The Board gives probative weight to treatment records from the Veteran's primary care physician and cardiology clinicians. The treatment visits document complaint and diagnosis of a variety of disabilities with no active complaint or diagnosis of vertigo or a vertigo-type disability. Treatment visits in January 2019, August 2019, March 2020, September 2020, November 2020, June 2021, and November specifically denied dizziness and syncope. The Board finds if an individual was experiencing symptoms of syncope or dizziness a couple times a month, this is the nature, frequency, and severity of symptom that would ordinarily be reported and recorded at treatment visits.

The Board considered the mentions in the record indicating a history of syncope. The evidence supports these were isolated episodes, not reaching a level of a functional impairment of earning capacity. A December 2017 echocardiogram report and head CT report indicated a history of syncope. Treatment records do not show subsequent complaint, treatment plan, or diagnosis related to syncope. A July 2022 treatment summary printout noted a history of syncope, described as "went to ER following bladder surgery when he was emptying urine catheter and was bending over and passed out, thought to be vagal in nature." Treatment records do not show subsequent complaint, treatment plan, or diagnosis related to syncope. The Board does not find the mentions of a history of syncope, when considered with the record as a whole, show a level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.

The Board considered the Veteran's hearing testimony that he experiences dizziness a couple times a month and has passed out three or four times. The Board finds the frequency described by the Veteran is not consistent with the evidence of record. As noted above, treatment records do not reflect active complaint or diagnosis of vertigo or vertigo-like symptoms. The Board finds if an individual was experiencing symptoms of syncope or dizziness a couple times a month, this is the nature, frequency, and severity of symptom that would ordinarily be reported and recorded at treatment visits. Additionally, VA examinations for hypertension, diabetes, and heart are silent for mention of dizziness or syncope as a symptom. VA examinations for heart conditions in February 2020 and November 2020 specifically denied syncope or dizziness. The November 2020 VA examination for hypertension denied any current symptoms. The February 2020 VA examination for diabetes denied other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms related to diabetes. The Board finds if an individual was experiencing vertigo, syncope, or dizziness a couple times a month, that he thought was related to his hypertension, diabetes, or heart disability, ordinarily this would be reported and recorded at a VA examination for these conditions.

A VA examination was not provided in conjunction with the Veteran's claim for vertigo and the Board finds the evidence of record does not require one. VA has a duty to provide an examination when the record lacks evidence to decide the Veteran's claim and there is evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service event, injury, or disease; and (3) some indication that the claimed disability may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006). The Board does not find a current disability with indication the disability may be associated with service to trigger the duty to provide an examination. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (explaining that something more than a veteran's conclusory, generalized statement is needed to trigger VA's duty to assist by providing a medical nexus examination).

Accordingly, service connection for vertigo is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for BCC with residual scars

The May 2023 Board remand found a duty to assist error regarding the medical opinion obtained for the claim for BCC. The Board found the AOJ obtained a medical opinion regarding whether BCC was secondary to ischemic heart disease; however, the AOJ did not obtain an opinion addressing the Veteran's contentions his BCC was due to exposure to herbicide agents or sun exposure during service. The Board remanded the claim for the AOJ to obtain a medical opinion.

The AOJ obtained a November 2023 medical opinion. The opinion found the Veteran's BCC with residual scars was less likely than not a result of service, to include conceded herbicide agent exposure and sun exposure during active service. The rationale was per medical literature from the Mayo Clinic, "Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck. Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight." The rationale continued that medical research from Cancer.org states, "Arsenic is an element found naturally in well water in some areas. It's also used in making some pesticides and in some other industries. Workers exposed to coal tar, paraffin, and certain types of petroleum products may also have an increased risk of skin cancer." 

The November 2023 medical opinion, issued prior to the rating decision on appeal, is inadequate. The medical opinion found BCC was less likely as not a result of herbicide exposure or sun exposure, but provided two possibly supportive medical literature quotations, without any further rationale or discussion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's BCC with residual scars. The clinician should answer:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's BCC is caused by conceded in-service exposure to herbicide agents? 

When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: (i.) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (ii.) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not the Veteran's BCC is caused by sun exposure during active service?
