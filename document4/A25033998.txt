REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1966 to January 1969.

This matter was appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2025 rating decision through submission of a March 2025 VA Form 10182 with election of the direct review appeal docket.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.

The Board notes that the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received and readjudicated the Veteran's claim for service connection for GERD in the January 2025 rating decision. The determination that new and relevant evidence has been received is a finding favorable to the claimant and is binding on the Board unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801(a). The issue on appeal has been characterized to reflect this favorable finding. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE ADJUDICATOR:

"	The Board notes that the AOJ obtained a medical opinion in December 2024 regarding whether the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder proximately caused his GERD disability; however, no opinion addressing aggravation by a service-connected disability was obtained. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error which necessitates that this claim be remanded. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW:

1. Request a medical opinion from a qualified examiner regarding service connection for GERD. The examiner must address the following, with a full supporting rationale:

Is any gastroesophageal disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) aggravated by a service-connected anxiety disorder?  Why or why not?

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy. See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b. Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report. 

The examiner is informed that a positive opinion does not require certainty.  Rather, if the weight of the evidence is in approximate balance for and against, the examiner should make a determination favorable to the Veteran.

All requested opinions must be supported with a rationale based on generally accepted medical principles and the examiner's medical training and expertise.

2. Readjudicate.
