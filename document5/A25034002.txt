ORDER

Service connection for paresthesia of a right index finger injury is granted.

Service connection for a linear distal right index finger scar as secondary to right index finger injury is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, paresthesia of the right index finger is etiologically related to active service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, a residual linear distal right index finger scar is proximately due to his in-service right index finger injury.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for paresthesia of a right index finger injury are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a residual linear distal right index finger scar are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2000 to May 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision and October 2024 higher level review from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that denied the Veteran's claim for right index finger numbness, finding that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's right index finger numbness is related to service.  The Board notes that subsequent to the Veteran's request for higher level review, additional development of the Veteran's claim was undertaken by the AOJ, converting the request to a supplemental claim.  Therefore, all evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 decision should have been considered as opposed to evidence of record at the time of the initial November 2023 decision.

The November 2023 and October 2024 rating decisions noted favorable findings that include that the Veteran's service treatment records reflect an in-service right index finger injury in May 2006 and current diagnosis of right index finger contusion with intact skin.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings unless they are rebutted by clear and unmistakable error.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A.

In October 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision.  In November 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of October 18, 2024.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

There is an alternative means of establishing service connection where a veteran served 90 days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id.  However, this alternative means is only available for certain "chronic disease" specifically enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), and in this case the record does not reflect that dysesthesias or paresthesia are among the listed diseases.  Therefore, the presumptive service connection provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) do not apply.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or?unpersuasive and?provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?36, 39-40 (1994).  Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events, or the presence of disability, or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Although lay persons are considered competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, some medical issues fall outside of the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion issued by a VA or private treatment provider takes into account such factors as its thoroughness and degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  Also significant is whether the examining medical provider had a sufficiently clear and well-reasoned rationale, as well as a basis in objective supporting clinical evidence.  See?Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999).  

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement.  Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Right Index Finger and Residual Scar

The Veteran asserts that he has right index finger numbness that onset during service when it was "smashed by a pintle hook on an aircraft tow vehicle" and that he received treatment at the Moody Air Force Base medical clinic.  See August 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.  His personnel records show that he worked as a Flying Crew Chief Aerospace Maintenance Journeyman.  See DD-214.

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of paresthesia of the right index finger.  See October 2024 VA Peripheral Nerves Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

The Board also recognizes that the November 2023 and October 2024 rating decisions reflect favorable findings of a current diagnosis of right index finger contusion with intact skin and an in-service right index finger injury on May 5, 2006.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings as they are not rebutted by clear and unmistakable error.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; Shedden, supra.

Given the foregoing, the first and second elements of service connection have been established. Id.  Therefore, the dispositive issue in this case is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's right index finger disability and service.

The Veteran is competent to report the circumstances giving rise to the initial observable symptoms, as well as the nature of the symptoms during and after service; however, he has not been shown to be competent to opine as to the etiology of complex disorders such as numbness, which is a medical question.  See Kahana, supra.

The Veteran was afforded a VA hand and fingers examination in November 2023.  The diagnosis was contusion with intact skin of right index finger.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reported numbness at the tip of his right index finger since the May 2006 in-service injury.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's right finger contusion it is less likely than not related to service.  The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran was treated for a right index finger injury while in the Air Force, "x-ray of the right index finger showed slight soft tissue swelling [and was] negative [for a] fracture," adding that review of service treatment records shows that "he did not have any complications following this incident.  He denied being evaluated or treated for numbness to right index finger during service and after he was released from active duty.  The Veteran has no medical records of right index finger numbness or condition after service."  See November 2023 VA Medical Opinion DBQ.

The November 2023 VA opinion impermissibly disregards the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of right index fingers symptoms.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007).  The examiner also relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence showing treatment of the Veteran's right index finger.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Accordingly, the Board assigns the November 2023 VA opinion low probative weight.

In August 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA peripheral nerves examination.  Although the Veteran reported during the examination that he has had right index finger numbness since his in-service injury, the examiner made no finding regarding numbness, disregarding the Veteran's competent lay statement.  Dalton, supra.  Therefore, the Board finds the August 2024 VA examination inadequate.

In October 2024, the Veteran was afforded a second VA peripheral nerves examination and a VA scars examination.  During the neurological examination, the examiner recorded the history of the in-service right index finger injury and treatment, including a negative in-service x-ray.  The Veteran reported that when he returned to school after separation from service, "and started having to write more, noticed with constant use there was a numbness along the tip of his right index finger[.]" He added that "after using it for a longer time [he would] get paresthesias that [is] very painful ... otherwise [it] always feels like its asleep."  On examination, the VA examiner noted mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and mild numbness.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's right median nerve was affected by mild, incomplete paralysis.  The diagnosis was paresthesia of the right index finger.  See October 2024 VA Peripheral Nerves Conditions DBQ.

During the October 2024 VA scars examination, the examiner noted a linear distal right index finger scar, residual to the finger injury, that measured 0.5 x 0.1 cm and was neither painful nor unstable.  See October 2024 VA Scars DBQ.

The October 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's paresthesia of the right index finger was at least as likely as not related to the in-service injury in May 2006 when he "smashed his right index finger with [a] vehicle and tow bar during an exercise."  The examiner added that the "Veteran continues to have a constant numbness at the fingertip where his crush injury occurred.  When putting direct pressure such as writing or using tools the numbness turns to a parasthesia and is more painful."

The October 2024 VA medical opinion is competent, credible and probative: It was authored by a licensed clinician who reviewed the Veteran's claims file and was therefore familiar with the Veteran's symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment of his right finger injury and associated numbness; the opinion was based on a review of the evidence of record as well as lay statements of the Veteran.  The opinion is consistent with the medical evidence of record, and contains clear conclusions connected by a reasoned medical explanation.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-02 (2008).  Notably, there are no medical opinions or other competent medical evidence of record that weighs against the October 2024 VA opinion.  Accordingly, the Board finds the October 224 VA medical opinion highly probative, competent and persuasive medical evidence in this case.

Based on this body of evidence, and resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively in favor of the claim, and that service connection for paresthesia of a right index finger injury is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  In reaching this determination the Board notes that the October 2024 rating decision completely ignored the favorable October 2024 VA medical opinion.

Lastly, given the October 2024 VA examiner's medical finding that the Veteran's linear distal right index finger scar is a residual of his in-service injury, and with resolution of any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for his linear distal right index finger scar is warranted on a secondary basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.
