DOCKET NO. 240716-458189
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Due to the appellant's death, the claim of entitlement to survivor's pension benefits is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In August 2024, the appellant died while the appeal was pending at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the appellant, the criteria for dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1965 to July 1967. He died in December 1997. The appellant, the Veteran's surviving spouse, died in August 2024.

In March 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2024 decision. In July 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2024 decision. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Unfortunately, the appellant died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the appellant's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the appellant's death. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a). In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the appellant. 

Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant." The form and filing instructions are available online at: https://www.va.gov/find-forms/

If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the appellant's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
