ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 10182 was received, no rating decision addressing service connection for a low back disability had been issued in the previous year.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of service connection for a low back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1984 to May 1996.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 letter of a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  

Service connection for a low back disability

In a December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran sought to reopen his claim for service connection for a low back disability.  In a March 2023 letter, the Veteran was informed that although VA had received mail indicating that he was seeking review of a claim for a back disability, VA regulations require that this request be filed on the proper form. This letter provided him with instructions on the proper form to use. 

In April 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement with the RO's failure to adjudicate his service connection claim.  That same month, he also filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim regarding this issue.  

At the time of receipt of the Veteran's April 2023 VA Form 10182, there was no prior rating decision addressing the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability for which appellate review could be granted.  Service connection for a low back disability had most recently been denied in a July 2009 rating decision, for which notice had been provided the Veteran that same month.  As neither a timely notice of disagreement nor new and material evidence was received with a year of that decision, it became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Thus, the April 2023 VA Form 10182 cannot be accepted as an appeal of this rating decision.  

Generally, the Board's jurisdiction is predicated upon an appeal having been filed on an issue or issues in controversy.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.  An appeal consists of a timely filed notice of disagreement (NOD).  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. § 20.200.  In this case, the April 2023 VA Form 10182 is not applicable to any appealable rating decision or other action by the agency of original jurisdiction.  It is not timely to the prior denial of service connection for a back disability.

As noted, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking service connection for his back disability one day after he filed the NOD from which this dismissal stems. In an April 2025 rating decision, the RO continued the prior denial of service connection for a low back disability.  The Veteran was informed of this denial, as well as his right to seek review of this decision.  He remains free to seek appellate review or other pertinent remedies regarding this rating decision, to include filing a new VA Form 10182 to initiate Board review, should he so desire.  

In conclusion, the issue of service connection for a low back disability is not properly before the Board.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202.  Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal is dismissed.
