ORDER

The appeal as to the proposed rating reduction of the 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In May 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to decrease the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain disability rating from 20 percent to 10 percent.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal as to the proposed rating reduction for service-connected lumbosacral strain are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2019 to October 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, among other things, proposed to reduce the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain from 20 percent to 10 percent.

The Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision in a May 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182) and selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). ?38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(1).  

As a final preliminary matter, the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed.  However, the Board interprets the Veteran's statements in this matter as reflecting an intent to seek review of the rating reduction that ultimately takes place as quickly as possible.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran wishes to forego waiting for the period to switch dockets to elapse.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up"). Moreover, by issuing the decision now, the Board will more quickly alert the Veteran to the fact that he must submit a NOD in response to the actual rather than proposed reduction, as discussed at the end of this decision.

The appeal as to the proposed rating reduction of lumbosacral strain

The May 2024 document entitled "Rating Decision" included a proposal to reduce the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain from 20 percent to 10 percent.  The Veteran submitted a May 2024 VA Form 10182 in response to the May 2024 proposed rating reduction.

However, a proposed reduction is not a decision that can be appealed to the Board. An NOD is "an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the AOJ and a desire to contest the result."  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d).  Just as a deferred rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed, a proposed rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed, because the factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date.  Cf. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011).  In other words, a decision that merely refers to future action is not a determination by the AOJ, and therefore the filing of a NOD on such a decision does not place the issue in appellate status. 

Thus, the Veteran attempted to appeal a proposed rating reduction in May 2024, which cannot be appealed.  Although the Board has jurisdiction to hear this appeal given that it has been docketed, it may dismiss an appeal when the relevant claims processing rules have not been followed.  Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 330 (2021) ("Although VA can require a claimant to fill out a particular form and can dismiss nonconforming or untimely filings in appropriate circumstances, none of this affects the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals of veterans benefits decisions"); Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262, 269 (2024) ("The Board thus erred in ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of Mr. Ferko's appeal because his NOD was not filed within section 7105(b)'s one-year period.  This doesn't mean, however, that the one-year deadline is irrelevant.  It is an "important and mandatory" component of section 7105(b)'s claim-processing rule.  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.S. 428, 435 (2011).  Such a claim-processing rule would be subject to waiver or forfeiture, but if the "mandatory claim-processing rule" is properly invoked, it "must be enforced."  Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. Servs., 583 U.S. 17, 20, 138 S. Ct. 13, 199 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2017).  Hence, VA need not accept an NOD filed outside that one-year period unless a claimant establishes an adequate excuse for the NOD's untimeliness.").

In dismissing such an appeal, "the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors."  Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 334.  As shown above, the applicable regulations require an appeal of the actual rating reduction and not the proposed reduction, and there is no evidence or argument that waiver of this rule would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.

Moreover, "[t]he Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees."  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a) ("the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees").  The Veteran did not in his May 2024 NOD identify a determination, decision, or issue with which he disagreed, as no rating reduction had yet taken place.  Therefore, there was no determination, decision, or issue with which he could disagree.  For the above reasons, dismissal of the appeal is warranted.

The Board notes that the Veteran may file an appeal with the Board using the VA Form 10182 in response to a rating decision that actually reduces the rating for the lumbosacral strain, should such a rating decision be issued.
