ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had IBS at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The appellant did not timely file a notice of disagreement (NOD), on VA Form 10182, to appeal the denial of the issues of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, a cervical spine disability, left and right hip disabilities, and a right shoulder disability; and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing the NOD, with respect to the decision dated May 5, 2023.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for IBS have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7105A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for a cervical spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7105A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2017 to August 2020.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 also identified a May 2023 rating decision from which she wished to appeal the issues of service connection for tinnitus, a cervical spine disability, left and right hip disabilities, and a right shoulder disability. The timeliness of that appeal is addressed below.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

The Veteran asserts that she has irritable bowel syndrome that is related to her active service.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

VA treatment records do not show any diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome or complaints or treatment for associated symptoms. The Veteran has not provided any other medical records showing such treatment.

The Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination for her claimed irritable bowel syndrome in March 2024 and did not attend the examination. Therefore, evidence that may have been helpful to the Veteran's claim was not able to be obtained. The Board notes that the duty to assist is not a one-way street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). 

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

The evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Service connection for irritable bowel syndrome is denied. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

3. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability

6. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (b), a claimant may appeal a rating decision to the Board by filing an NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary within one year after the date of the mailing of the letter notifying the claimant of the decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203. An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. A request for an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. The Board will then determine whether good cause for an extension has been established. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.203 (c).

In this case, the appellant was notified of the decision denying her claims for service connection for tinnitus, a cervical spine disability, left and right hip disabilities, and a right shoulder disability on May 5, 2023. More than one year later, on September 8, 2024, an NOD on VA Form 10182, signed and dated the same date, was received in an attempt to appeal the denial of the claims for service connection for tinnitus, a cervical spine disability, left and right hip disabilities, and a right shoulder disability. 

Notably, the appellant did not request an extension for filing her NOD or otherwise provide evidence of good cause for the untimely filing of her NOD. There is no argument or other indication in the record that the appellant did not timely receive the May 5, 2023 notice letter. VA regulations are binding on all who seek to come within their sphere, "regardless of actual knowledge of what is in the regulations or of the hardship resulting from innocent ignorance." See Morris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 260 (1990) (citing Fed. Crop Ins. Corp. v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 385 (1947)). 

As the appellant's VA Form 10182 was not received until September 8, 2024, more than one year after the rating decision was issued, the Board finds that the NOD was not timely filed. Further, the Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the NOD. Where the NOD was not timely filed, and because good cause has not been shown for extending the time to file the NOD, the appeal as to these issues must be dismissed.
