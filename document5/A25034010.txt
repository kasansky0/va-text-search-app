ORDER

Entitlement to payment of the cost of ambulance transportation provided to the Veteran on May 5, 2021, is dismissed.   

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2024, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1968 to January 1970.  He died in January 2024.    

This matter is on appeal before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) from a decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In November 2021, a notice of disagreement selecting Evidence Review by a Veterans Law Judge was received.

On the November 2021 NOD, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing a denial of VA payment through the beneficiary travel program for ambulance transportation that was provided to him on May 5, 2021.  See e.g., 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.2, 70.4, 70.10, 70.20  

Unfortunately, he died in January 2024 while this appeal was still pending before the Board.  In this situation, the Board is required, as a matter of law, to dismiss the appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a) ("An appeal pending before the Board of Veterans Appeals when the appellant dies will be dismissed without prejudice").   Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.  Id.
