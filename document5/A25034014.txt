ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The competent evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is causally related to the Veteran's active duty military service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis/sinus condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from February 1977 to February 1980.

This matter initially came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Subsequently, the Board issued a March 2024 order which denied service connection for allergic rhinitis/sinus condition.  The Veteran appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  A December 2024 CAVC Order vacated the Board's decision and remanded the issue to the Board for further development and readjudication consistent with the terms of a December 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR).

Pursuant to the JMR, the Veteran was to be sent a letter affording the Veteran 90 days to submit additional argument or evidence.  The Veteran waived the 90-day period by way of a February 2025 correspondence.  Additionally, the Court found that the Veteran's intent to select a docket on which to proceed with his appeal on the VA Form 10182 filed October 5, 2020, was unclear.  As such, the Board was instructed to clarify the Veteran's intent to select a docket option.  On the face of the 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket.  However, the Veteran submitted medical evidence with the Form 10182, which would indicate that the Veteran intended to select the Evidence Docket.  Resolving the matter in a way which is most advantageous to the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran intended to proceed on the Evidence Docket. 

Therefore, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

The Board acknowledges that service connection for maxillary and frontal sinusitis with allergic rhinitis was granted via a September 2024 rating decision.

Service connection.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after military discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to the period of military service, establishes that the disease was incurred during the active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1113 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, the VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the Veteran.

Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is granted.

The Veteran contends that his allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is related to his active duty military service.  After reviewing all evidence on file, and considering the pertinent laws and regulations, the Board finds that the Veteran's contention is warranted.  

In a September 2020 rating decision, the VA concedes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.  Further, the VA concedes that the Veteran's conditions had an in-service occurrence.  Accordingly, the first two elements of service connection have been satisfied.  The remaining issue to be decided is whether the Veteran's sinusitis and rhinitis are causally related to his in-service occurrence.

The Veteran attended a VA examination in May 2017.  The examiner opined that is less likely than not that the Veteran's sinusitis and rhinitis were incurred in or caused by an in-service event.  The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's in-service treatment records did not show an in-service occurrence of the Veteran's sinus or rhinitis conditions.  The examiner specifically indicated that he could not find evidence that the Veteran sought medical attention while in the military.  As the Veteran's April 1979 in-service medical records do document treatment for sinus congestion, the Board finds that this report is predicated upon an incorrect factual premise.  Accordingly, the Board does not afford this report any probative weight.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based upon an inaccurate or incomplete factual premise is not probative). 

An addendum to the May 2017 report was issued in April 2019.  The examiner again opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is related to his military service.  The examiner did acknowledge the April 1979 in-service treatment for sinus congestion.  However, the examiner reasoned that there was no evidence of a chronic sinus condition at that time.  Specifically, the examiner stated that a one-time occurrence does not support a diagnosis of a chronic condition.

The Veteran was also afforded a VA medical examination in November 2019.  The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is related to his military service.  The examiner considered the April 1979 treatment records for sinus congestion.  However, the examiner concluded that the in-service sinus congestion the Veteran experienced was an acute episode of sinus problems and not indicative of a chronic condition.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2020.  The examiner acknowledged the April 1979 service treatment record which showed treatment for the sinuses.  However, the examiner ultimately opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's current sinus/rhinitis conditions are causally related to his in-service occurrence.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's complaints were subjective only and no nexus was established.  The examiner's opinion was not supported by any rationale and is therefore afforded little probative weight. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted an October 2020 private medical report.  The physician indicated that he had reviewed the Veteran's service treatment records from 1979.  The physician indicated that the radiology report from that time revealed sinus disease.  The physician further stated that he believed that the Veteran has suffered from chronic sinus disease since his in-service occurrence in 1979.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's statements in support of his claim, including his August 2017 statement.  The Board finds these statements credible to the extent that they report the Veteran's symptoms, the onset of his symptoms, and the chronicity of his symptoms.   A Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  

When the negative VA opinions of record are weighed against the Veteran's October 2020 private medical report, the evidence is, at a minimum, equally balanced on this issue.  As such, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is causally related to his active duty military service.  Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for allergic rhinitis/sinus condition is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
