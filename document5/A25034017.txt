CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for Entitlement to an evaluation for PTSD greater than 70 percent prior to April 7, 2021, and greater than 100 percent from April 7, 2021, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, DC 9411.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a disability evaluation greater than 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87 DC 6260.

4. The criteria for establishing entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

5. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to November 15, 2019, for entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

6. The criteria for readjudicating the claim of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1972 to June 1975.

This appeal stems from a September 2022 higher-level review decision. In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance and to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an evaluation for PTSD greater than 70 percent prior to April 7, 2021, and greater than 100 percent from April 7, 2021, is denied.

The Veteran requests an increased rating for his service-connected PTSD "for all periods on appeal." See VA Form 10182. The AOJ rated the Veteran's PTSD under DC 9411. The 70 percent rating criteria are:

Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. The 100 percent rating criteria are:

Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self of others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or name.

Id. A claimant "may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). "Although the veteran's symptomatology is the primary consideration, the regulation also requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the veteran's level of impairment." Id. at 117-118; see Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 18 (2017) (Section 4.130 requires the "symptoms [to] have caused the level of occupational and social impairment associated with a particular disability evaluation"). 

A September 18, 2012, treatment record states that a PTSD screen was negative. See March 23, 2014, CAPRI records. The Veteran denied nightmares, avoidance, being on guard, watchful, or easily startled, and feeling numb or detached from his surroundings.

In an October 2013 statement, the Veteran said he has overwhelming thoughts, poor sleep, nightmares, paranoia, and social anxiety. He stated that he was isolated from friends, family, and people in general.

VA provided the Veteran with a medical examination in December 2013. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas. The examiner did not opine that the Veteran's PTSD causes total occupational and social impairment. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and the inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The examiner noted that the Veteran had irritable behavior, angry outbursts, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbances. The examiner opined that the Veteran did not have any PTSD symptoms that were not listed in the examination report.

On April 18, 2013, the Veteran denied depression, homicidal ideation, and suicidal ideation. See VISTA records printed on July 26, 2017. The Veteran was oriented times three, had intact recent and remote memory, had normal mood and affect, and good insight and judgment.

On September 8, 2014, the Veteran reported little interest or pleasure in doing things and feelings of depression or haplessness. See VISTA records printed on July 26, 2017.

VA provided the Veteran with a PTSD examination in December 2014. The examiner opined that the Veteran did not have PTSD, but instead had generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia. The examiner opined that the Veteran's psychiatric disorders cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. The Veteran denied current suicidal and homicidal ideation. He stated that his only previous suicidal ideations were while he was on active duty. He denied hallucinations. He told the examiner that he had difficulty sleeping. He said he slept five to seven hours per night and had all the energy that he needs during the daytime. The Veteran reported that he had no friends and that he is often verbally abusive. The Veteran's symptoms were depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficult in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A May 2015 letter from Dr. R.B. states that the Veteran has intrusive recollections, nightmares, anxiety, dissociative experiences, anger, panic, anxiety, and chronic insomnia. Dr. R.B. also opined that the Veteran has hypervigilance, difficulty concentrating, and an exaggerated startle response. Dr. R.B. opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes impairment with social and occupational functioning.

A September 23, 2015, treatment record states that the Veteran had no suicidal or homicidal ideation, that he was oriented times three, had recent memory issues, had intact remote memory, had no abnormal mood or affect, and had good insight and judgment. See September 4, 2018, CAPRI records.

The Veteran and his wife testified at a Regional Office (RO) hearing in March 2016. The Veteran's wife testified that-at that time-she had been married to the Veteran for around 25 years. She testified that the Veteran took a variety of medications for his PTSD and that she gives him the medications to protect him from overdosing. She stated that the Veteran had persistent explosive behavior, persistent nightmares, and persistent night terrors, that he does not sleep, and that he is anxious.

A September 30, 2016, progress note states that the Veteran had "off and on" suicidal thoughts. See September 4, 2018, CAPRI records. The Veteran screened positive for depression, and his symptoms included having little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, having trouble falling or staying asleep, feeling tired, having a poor appetite, feeling bad about himself, having trouble concentrating, and feeling that he would be better off dead.

A May 22, 2017, treatment record states that the Veteran was not having suicidal ideation and did not think that he would try to hurt himself. See September 4, 2018, CAPRI records. A PTSD screen was negative. The Veteran denied nightmares, avoidance, being on guard, or feeling numb or detached from activities. A depression screen was also negative. The Veteran denied having little interest or pleasure in doing things, feeling down, feeling depressed, or feeling hopeless.

A June 19, 2017, treatment record states that the Veteran did not have suicidal ideation. See VISTA records printed July 26, 2017.

The Veteran denied suicidal thoughts in a June 19, 2017, treatment record. See September 4, 2018, CAPRI records.

An October 3, 2018, treatment record states that the Veteran had an episode of depression the previous evening. He reported that he had little interest in doing things and was feeling down, depressed, or hopeless over the last several days. The Veteran did not think he would be better off dead or have thoughts of hurting himself, and the examiner opined that he was not a suicide risk. See February 19, 2019, CAPRI records.

A July 29, 2019, treatment record states that the Veteran experienced paranoia when he is around a lot of people, and it stated that the Veteran had nightmares that caused him to wake up screaming. See VISTA records printed January 23, 2020. The Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres, displayed appropriate eye contact, appropriated grooming, and appropriate affect. The Veteran's speech was adequate, and there was no evidence of memory impairment, thought disorder, or psychotic features. The Veteran reported that he did not have suicidal thoughts. The examiner noted that the Veteran attended church, had hobbies, and good family support.

During an August 13, 2019, psychiatry initial evaluation consult, the Veteran reported that he was doing pretty good under the circumstances. See VISTA records printed January 23, 2020. He said that he had some depressive symptoms that are consistent, but that he was currently stable. He denied any significant problems or concerns, to include safety concerns. He reported that he slept five to six hours per night and felt refreshed in the morning. He sometimes had nightmares, but he had not had one in approximately six months. He reported feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, and mild anxiety. He had nightmares and recurrent thoughts but no hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, suicidal or homicidal ideation, or plans to harm himself or others. He stated that he had been married for 28 years to a wife who is a good support source for him, that he socialized at the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), did "colors at the football games," and attended church. The Veteran was casually attired, well groomed, spoke normally, made good eye contact, and had coherent, logical, and goal-directed thoughts. His mood was stable, and the examiner observed no signs or symptoms of mania or psychosis. The Veteran displayed insight and judgment that were adequate for consequences of actions. The examiner described the Veteran's PTSD as chronic, moderate in severity, and in partial remission.

A separate VA treatment record from August 13, 2019, states that the Veteran's PTSD was causing nightmares, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts. See VISTA records printed January 23, 2020. The treatment provider also found that the Veteran's mood was depressed.

The Veteran submitted a December 2019 written statement. He reported that every night he went to bed afraid that he would have a nightmare. He stated that he sleeps around four hours per night, and that he has recurrent nightmares that are so terrifying that he would hit his wife while he slept. He stated that he has panic attacks "almost every hour of every day." He said that he is afraid of leaving his afraid of associating with anyone except his wife, and he does not have any friends. He stated that he only leaves his house once or two times per week, and he said that going out in public makes him uncomfortable.

A February 2020 examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The examiner did not opine that the PTSD causes total occupational and social impairment. The examination report notes that the Veteran had been married for 29 years and that he was close to his 25-year-old son. He had not seen his oldest son or grandchildren for seven years. He stated that he was not social. His symptoms included fear, uncertainty about the future, nightmares, trouble sleeping, isolation, and depressed mood due to stress. He denied active suicidal and homicidal ideation, but he wondered what it would be like "on the other side." The examiner found that the Veteran has a persistent negative emotional state, feelings of detachment or estrangement, and sleep disturbance. The Veteran's PTSD causes depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once a week, and suicidal ideation.

A September 2020 vocational opinion states that the Veteran's PTSD, tinnitus, and hearing loss would preclude employment.

Private treatment records dated from January 2020 to December 2020, state that the Veteran denied suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, delusions, and hallucinations. See Records Received May 21, 2021. He reported that he continued to have nightmares. His mood ranged from "OK" to frustrated, and his affect was restricted. His speech was normal, and his memory was intact. The Veteran's insight and judgment were fair.

VA obtained an additional medical opinion in April 2021. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes total occupational and social impairment.

The Board has considered the lay and medical evidence and finds that, prior to April 7, 2021, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms include a depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur more than once a week or every hour of every day, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, diminished interest in activities, avoidance, flashbacks, negative beliefs, distorted cognition, detachment, estrangement from others, restrictive affect, temper or anger outbursts, hypervigilance, difficulty concentrating, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, fear of confined spaces, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting. The evidence does not suggest that the Veteran's PTSD causes hallucinations, the inability to perform activities of daily living, gross impairment in thought processes or communications, a persistent danger of hurting self or others, a disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. The Board also observes that the symptoms in the rating schedule are not exhaustive. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 440-441 (2002). However, the Board finds that none of the Veteran's symptoms are similar in severity to those contemplated by the total disability rating criteria, even if they are not specifically listed in DC 9411's rating criteria. The Veteran has distorted cognitions related to his traumatic event, but this does not rise to the level of gross impairment in thought processes or communications. Although the Veteran does have angry outbursts, there is no evidence that he is a danger to others or that his behavior is grossly inappropriate. The Board finds that the angry outbursts and similar symptoms are more like-at worst-impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence) and are contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria.

The Board further finds it persuasive that none of the examiners, to include Dr. R.B. and the 2020 vocational expert, opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes total occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117. Prior to April 7, 2021, the VA examiners opined that the Veteran's occupational impairment was, at worst, occupational impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 

The Board acknowledges the lay assertions that the Veteran is entitled to a higher rating. However, the Board finds that the medical evidence is more probative than the lay evidence of record, particularly in the context of whether the Veteran experiences total social impairment. As noted above, the medical evidence documents that the Veteran has a solid relationship with his wife and occasional social activities such as attending VFW events, football games, and church. The Board finds that this evidence is more persuasive on the issue of the Veteran's level of social impairment.

The AOJ awarded a 100 percent rating for TDIU from April 7, 2021, which is the date that the Secretary received a supplemental claim. However, the rating period under review pre-dates April 7, 2021. The question for the Board is not whether the Board would have selected that date in the first instance but is instead whether the Board finds that it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD warrants a 100 percent rating prior to April 7, 2021. A December 29, 2020, treatment record states that the Veteran continued to have nightmares, had a frustrated mood, and had a restricted affect. However, the Board finds that the symptoms and level of impairment that this treatment record describes fall short of what is necessary to establish entitlement to a 100 percent rating. Further, as discussed above, the weight of the evidence prior to April 7, 2021, does not demonstrate entitlement to a total rating for PTSD. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's impairment caused total occupational and social impairment prior to April 7, 2021. See Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

A Rating Greater than 100 Percent from April 7, 2021

The Veteran's VA Form 10182 states that he seeks a higher rating for PTSD "for all periods on appeal," which includes the period from April 7, 2021. The Veteran's PTSD is rated 100 percent from that date, and this is the highest disability rating for PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. Indeed, Congress did not authorize the Secretary to provide disability ratings above 100 percent. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ("The schedule shall be constructed so as to provide ten grades of disability and no more, upon which payments of compensation shall be based, namely 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent, and total, 100 percent."). Because the Veteran receives the highest disability rating that allowed by law, there is no basis in fact or law for the Board to award a higher rating. Therefore, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve, and the appeal is denied.

2. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran appeals the non-compensable rating assigned for his bilateral hearing loss.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 cycles per second (Hz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII. 

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1,000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2,000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b).

The Veteran underwent an audiology examination in January 2014. The puretone threshold scores were:

Ear	1,000 Hz	2,000 Hz	3,000 Hz	4,000 Hz	Avg Hz

Right	15	15	20	25	18.75

Left	15	20	70	70	43.75

The speech discrimination scores were 98 percent in both ears. The Veteran reported difficulty hearing conversation, especially when there was background noise.

An April 22, 2019, VA primary care physician note states that the Veteran's hearing was normal. See VISTA Records printed January 23, 2020. A July 2, 2019, audiology evaluation states that the Veteran reported difficulty hearing with background noise. He also reported numbness and fullness in his left ear during the previous year. The examiner recommended that the Veteran see an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to determine the cause of the numbness and fullness. A September 26, 2019, addendum states that the ENT recommended that the Veteran undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out retrocochlear pathology for the Veteran's symptoms, but he declined the MRI due to claustrophobia.

In a December 2019 declaration, the Veteran said that his tinnitus and hearing loss prevent him from understanding "a lot" of what is said around him. He stated that he can only hear out of one ear.

A February 2020 examination report states that the Veteran's puretone threshold test results were:

Ear	1,000 Hz	2,000 Hz	3,000 Hz	4,000 Hz	Avg Hz

Right	20	30	45	50	36.25

Left	25	50	70	75	55

The speech discrimination scores were 96 percent in the right ear and 98 percent in the left ear. The Veteran stated that he had to turn the television volume high, which causes problems with others. He also reported problems with background noises and hearing people who speak in certain pitches. The examiner opined that the functional impact of the Veteran's hearing loss could be mitigated by using amplification.

The January 2014 and February 2020 audiometry test results translate to Level I impairment in both ears. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VI. Neither test result represents an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.86. Level I hearing in both ears equates to a non-compensable rating under the schedule for rating hearing acuity. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VII. Therefore, the audiometry test results persuasively demonstrate that the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record when adjudicating this claim, including contentions that the Veteran has trouble hearing, particularly when there is background noise. The Veteran is competent to report difficulty hearing, and the Board finds that he is credible. However, the Board assigns disability ratings for hearing loss using a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's lay statements are not competent evidence of entitlement to a higher schedular rating because they are not evidence of audiometry test results that are necessary to rate the Veteran's hearing loss. See, e.g., Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay evidence is generally not competent to identify complex conditions).

The rating criteria contemplate speech reception thresholds and ability to hear spoken words on Maryland CNC testing. The rating criteria contemplates functional impacts such as difficulty hearing when there is background noise. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 371 (2017). The Veteran's main complaint is reduced hearing acuity and clarity, which is what the assigned rating contemplates. See Rossy v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 142, 145 (2017).

The Board also observes that the Veteran's treatment records note that he reported symptoms of ear numbness or fullness to his treating audiologist. However, the evidence does not demonstrate that those symptoms are associated with or proximately due to the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss, and the Veteran declined further testing to determine their cause. 

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

3. Entitlement to a disability evaluation greater than 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran seeks a higher disability rating for his service-connected tinnitus, which the AOJ rated as 10 percent disabling under DC 6260. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260. Diagnostic Code 6260 provides a 10 percent rating for recurrent tinnitus. Id.

During a January 2014 examination report, the Veteran reported tinnitus that was not constant, but often. He described the tinnitus as bothersome. However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus did not impact the ordinary conditions of his daily life or his ability to work.

A July 2, 2019, audiology record states that the Veteran reported tinnitus with increased volume on the left side. He described the tinnitus a constant zinging sound.

In a December 2019 declaration, the Veteran said that his tinnitus and hearing loss prevent him from understanding "a lot" of what is said around him. 

The Veteran informed the February 2020 examiner that his tinnitus was progressively worsening, constant, high pitched, bilateral, and worse in his left ear. He stated that it interferes with his sleep, and that the tinnitus is worse when it is quiet and at night. 

Diagnostic code 6260 provides a maximum 10 percent rating for tinnitus, "regardless [of] whether the tinnitus is unilateral or bilateral." See Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Veteran already receives this ten percent rating. The Veteran describes his tinnitus symptoms as a noise that he hears in his ears. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1900 (33rd Ed. 2020) (defining tinnitus as "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. It is usually subjective in type."). Because the rating schedule contemplates tinnitus, it necessarily contemplates those symptoms and their functional effects. 

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a rating above 10 percent for tinnitus, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

4. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to April 7, 2021, is granted.

The Veteran appeals the AOJ's denial of entitlement to a TDIU.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination that is specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., the veteran's work history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

A March 1992 letter from Dr. D.L. states that the Veteran had experience working as an upsetter operator. After his hand injury, he did machine maintenance in the same factory. He subsequently left that job and worked for two and a half years washing aluminum castings. He then worked for five years as a bible salesman, and then he worked as an orderly in a nursing home. The Veteran subsequently became a certified medication assistant and worked for two years in that capacity. The Veteran obtained a special license to drive a truck, and then he worked as a truck driver. However, his truck driving license was not renewed due to his left-hand injury, so he stopped working. Dr. D.L. opined that the Veteran's hand disabilities made him incapable of resuming his work activities, and he recommended that the Veteran pursue vocational rehabilitation.

In a March 1994 letter, the Veteran stated that he completed a General Educational Development (GED) and one year of college.

An August 1999 letter from Dr. R.C. states that the Veteran can drive a lawn tractor. The letter also states that the Veteran raises Labrador retrievers as a hobby. 

In a July 2014 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran asserted that he stopped working as a truck driver due to PTSD.

In a February 2015 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU.

An April 2019 Social Security Administration (SSA) statement demonstrates that the Veteran did not have any taxed Social Security earnings since 1988.

In a December 2019 statement, the Veteran reported that he attempted to work minimal jobs from 1986 to 1988 and was unable to maintain them due to his PTSD.

The February 2020 PTSD examiner opined that the Veteran's anxiety, depressed mood, panic attacks, and difficulty maintaining relationships might hinder his ability to function in occupational environments because he might have problems working with others. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's PTSD could make it difficult to perform in environments that are stressful or require a high level of alertness.

The Veteran submitted a vocational opinion from E.C., MA, CDMS, that is dated September 2020. He opined that the Veteran is more likely than not unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his PTSD, tinnitus, and hearing loss. He reasoned that the Veteran's irritability, angry outbursts, inability to maintain effective work relationships, and difficulty communicating would lead to significant problems that would preclude the Veteran from working.

The April 22, 2021, PTSD examiner opined that the Veteran has total occupational and social impairment due to PTSD. The examiner opined that the Veteran is dependent on others for care and is likely to have difficulty fulfilling even simple tasks required by an employer. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's emotional limitations are magnified by his physical limitations and frustrations associated with his losses from physical trauma.

An April 28, 2021, VA treatment record states that the Veteran was interested in obtaining a new prosthetic for his right arm. See VISTA records printed April 28, 2021. He informed the treatment provider that he was highly active on his farm, and that he uses his prosthetic for all farm- and home-related tasks such as running a chainsaw. He stated that he "works as a farmer, so he heavily relies on his body powered prosthesis for operating heavy machinery and competing tasks around his farm."

The Board incorporates the facts regarding the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, which it discussed above, by reference.

The AOJ determined that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU, and the Board finds that this finding is not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.16(a), 20.801(a). 

With respect to Ray's economic component, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has not had substantially gainful employment since 1988.

The Veteran obtained a GED and completed one year of college. He also has training to be a certified medication assistant, and he has had the ability to obtain a license to drive a commercial truck. His inability to obtain that license was not due to his service-connected disabilities.

The Veteran has worked a variety of jobs, including factory work, sales, truck driving, and nursing home assistance. He has skills such as being able to operate a lawn tractor and chain saw, operating a farm, and raising dogs, which the Board finds to be skills that are equivalent to occupational skills. See Airline v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 238, 252 (2021) (Board members have experience in work environments and can draw upon common knowledge or general experience about work environments when assessing TDIU evidence).

The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus make it difficult for the Veteran to hear, and those disabilities impair his ability to communicate. The Veteran's PTSD interferes with his ability to interact with other people, to cope with stress, and to be alert. Although the February 2020 examiner did not opine that the Veteran's PTSD causes "total" occupational impairment, the examiner did describe a high degree of occupational impairment that suggests that the Veteran cannot maintain substantially gainful employment. See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (a TDIU does not require 100 percent unemployability). The Board also finds that Mr. E.C.'s September 2020 vocational opinion that the Veteran's PTSD, hearing loss, and tinnitus cumulatively preclude the Veteran from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment is probative evidence in support of a TDIU. The record does not contain any evidence finding that the Veteran's PTSD, hearing loss, and tinnitus, when considered together, do not preclude work. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney asserts that he is entitled to an October 22, 2012, effective date for the award of entitlement to a TDIU. However, because the AOJ did not grant entitlement to a TDIU, it has never assigned a TDIU effective date. The Board finds that the effective date for the TDIU grant is a downstream element that the AOJ must address in the first instance. See Urban v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 143, 145 (2004); Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 396, 399 (1999) (describing the assignment of an effective date as a downstream issue).

Therefore, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and grant entitlement to a TIDU prior to April 7, 2021.

5. Referral for consideration of an extraschedular TDIU for a single disability prior to and from April 7, 2021, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a TDIU for the entire rating period under review, to include as due to his bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. See VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's PTSD is rated as 100 percent disabling from April 7, 2021. Therefore, from April 7, 2021, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU based on all the Veteran's service-connected disabilities "effectively is mooted." See Locklear v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 311, 314 n.2 (2011) ("Because Mr. Locklear has been awarded a 100 [percent] schedular disability rating effective from May 20, 1990, entitlement to TDIU since that date effectively is mooted."); Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (holding that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU due to PTSD was moot because the claimant had been awarded a 100 percent schedular rating for heart disease).

However, entitlement to a TDIU based on a single disability other than PTSD is not moot because a TDIU based on either bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus could confer entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 254 (2011); 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). In addition, because the Veteran is in receipt of a 70 percent or higher rating for his service-connected PTSD throughout the rating period under review, a TDIU based on either bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus alone throughout the entire rating period could lead to additional benefits. Therefore, the Board will consider whether either the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus independently warrant entitlement to a TDIU both prior to and from April 7, 2021.

For the entire rating period under review, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is rated as non-compensable, and his tinnitus is rated as 10 percent disabling. Neither disability rating satisfies the schedular criteria for a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

However, "rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards" for a schedular TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The Board cannot assign an extraschedular TDIU in the first instance. See Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2001).

The Board incorporates the relevant facts described above by reference.

The Board finds that the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus impair his ability to communicate. For example, he has trouble hearing with background noise, and he often needs to look at a person directly to understand speech. He also states that his tinnitus disturbs his sleep.

The Board finds that the Veteran is qualified to pursue unskilled labor that requires little face-to-face communication. He has worked a variety of jobs, which demonstrate that he is able to learn new skills and to adapt to different work environments. The Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus do not interfere with his ability to sit, to stand, to move around, to lift heavy objects, or to do physical work in general. The Veteran has experience in factory work, and he has skills such as the ability to drive a lawn tractor and to use a chainsaw that are relevant to outdoor jobs such as law maintenance. The Board finds that although the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus each impair the Veteran's ability to hear and to communicate, the evidence does not suggest that either disability-by itself-precludes him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation. Although the Veteran states that his tinnitus interferes with sleeping, he has not stated that it makes him so tired that he is unable to work. There is also no evidence stating that the Veteran's hearing loss or tinnitus makes him unemployable. The Board emphasizes that although the Veteran is unemployable due to a combination of service-connected and non-service-connected disabilities, it is only considering the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus in this analysis. Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a TDIU based solely on either bilateral hearing loss or tinnitus, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

6. Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 15, 2019, for the grant of service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran's VA Form 10182 states that he seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for right ear hearing loss.

In general, the effective date for the award of service-connected compensation is the "date of receipt of the claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i); see 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). If VA receives a completed application for benefits within one year after receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the claim filed on the date that it received the intent to file the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). A claim must be on the form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160.

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claimant could file a claim for compensation via an informal claim. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57, 660 (Sept. 25, 2014); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2014). An informal claim must contain that "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

For pending legacy claims not under the modernized review system, new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim that was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). "New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim." Id. § 3.156(a). When new and material evidence is received within the appeal period, the "effective date will be as though the former decision had not been rendered." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q); see Davis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 131, 136 (2021). Legacy claims are those that were decided prior to the February 19, 2019, effective date of the modernized review system and have not been opted into the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.2; 3.2400.

The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss in March 2014. The AOJ mailed this rating decision to the Veteran, and it notified him of his appellate rights.

The Secretary received the Veteran's intent to file on November 15, 2019. The Veteran filed a claim in January 2020, which the AOJ determined raised the issue of entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss.

First, the Board must determine whether the March 2014 rating decision is final. When the AOJ denies a claim and the claimant does not file a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within the one-year period following that decision, the AOJ decision becomes final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52, 55 (2006); Person v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 449, 550 (1993). The March 2014 rating decision and its cover letter denied entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss, explained the bases for the denial, and provided the Veteran with appellate rights. The Board has reviewed the record, and it finds that the Veteran did not file an NOD within one year of that decision. Therefore, the Board finds that the March 2014 rating decision is final.

Second, the Board observes that the March 2014 rating decision pre-dates February 19, 2019. Consequently, it was a pending legacy claim not under the modernized review system, and section 3.156(b) applies. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 19.2. The March 2014 rating decision determined that the Veteran was not entitled to service connection for right ear hearing loss because he did not have a current right ear hearing loss disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The Secretary did not receive new and material evidence within the year after March 2014 because he did not receive any evidence that would tend to show that the Veteran had a right ear hearing loss disability during that time. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an earlier effective date under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

Third, the Board finds that the Veteran did not seek to reopen the claim prior to November 15, 2019. The Board has carefully reviewed the record, and it finds that the record does not contain a formal claim of entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss between the March 2014 rating decision and November 15, 2019. The Board also finds that, prior to March 24, 2015, the record does not contain an informal claim for service connection for right ear hearing loss that post-dates the March 2014 rating decision. Consequently, the Board finds that the November 15, 2019, date of receipt of the Veteran's intent to file is the earliest date on which it can assign an effective date. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for an effective date prior to November 15, 2019, for the grant of service connection for right ear hearing loss, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied.  

7. New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the claim of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance is warranted.

The Veteran argues that the Board should grant SMC based on the Veteran's need for regular aid and attendance by another person. See August 2023 written argument: 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l). He argues that, although the AOJ did not address that issue in the decision on appeal, that he is raising SMC as part of the increased rating claims on appeal. Citing Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991).

The Veteran's argument fails to note, however, that the AOJ already denied SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance in a February 2015 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal that denial, and it is final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); DiCarlo, 20 Vet. App. at 55; Person, 5 Vet. App. at 550.

After VA decides a claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2). When new and relevant evidence is "presented or secured with respect" to a supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim and consider all the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators." 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). "Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim." Id.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that claimants are not required to file a "formal claim" to assert entitlement ancillary benefits such as SMC. See Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 387 (2019). Because the Court held that no formal claim it required, it held that the Board erred when it declined to exercise jurisdiction over an explicitly raised theory of entitlement to SMC. Id. Although the Court's case law does not address entitlement to SMC when the AOJ has already denied that issue, the Board will assume jurisdiction over whether there is new and relevant evidence regarding the 2015 denial.

The Veteran argues that he requires regular aid and attendance because he needs to have his medication monitored to prevent suicide. His wife's March 2016 hearing testimony states that she monitors his medication for that very reason. This evidence is new because it was not before the AOJ in 2015, and it is relevant because it relates to whether the Veteran requires regular aid and attendance. Therefore, the Board finds that there is new and relevant evidence and readjudication of the issue of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

7. Entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance is remanded.

As discussed above, new and relevant evidence has been received and readjudication of the claim of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance is warranted. The Veteran has a procedural right to have one review of his appeal by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a), and amendments under the AMA do not specifically revoke that right. Thus, the issue must be remanded so that the AOJ can consider the claim on the merits.

8. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is remanded.

For purposes of entitlement to DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, basic eligibility exists if, among other things, a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021. The Board has granted entitlement to a TDIU, and the AOJ will assign the downstream effective date for that award in the first instance. Because the effective date for DEA eligibility is derivative of the effective date of an award of a permanent and total disability rating, the Board finds that the effective date for the award of DEA eligibility is inextricably intertwined with the effective date for the award of entitlement to a TDIU. See Tyrues v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 166, 178-179 (2009) (en banc) (declining to consider a matter on prudential grounds when it is inextricably intertwined with a matter pending below). Therefore, the Board will remand the matter for the AOJ to address the matter after it assigns the effective date for the TDIU grant. See also Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 135-136 (2024).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. As the Board has found that new and relevant evidence has been received in support of the Veteran's previously denied claim of entitlement to SMC based on the need for regular aid and attendance, readjudicate the claim on its merits in the first instance. Consideration must be given to the new and relevant evidence described above, including the 2016 hearing testimony.

2. After the AOJ assigns an effective date for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU, readjudicate whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date prior to April 7, 2021, for eligibility to DEA benefits.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
