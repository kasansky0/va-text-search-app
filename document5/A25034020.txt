DOCKET NO. 250115-525000
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD) is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for acne (claimed as chloracne) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's CAD  manifested to a compensable degree and is presumed to be related herbicide exposure in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for CAD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1968 to July 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from January 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

The Veteran originally sought service connection for CAD and chloracne in January 2012 claims that were denied in a June 2013 rating decision. In September 2015, the Veteran sought to reopen his claims, and a February 2016 rating decision denied the Veteran's request, finding that the evidence submitted was not new and material. A July 2019 supplemental claim again sought to reopen the claims. An October 2021 rating decision found the Veteran had not submitted new and relevant evidence but appears to have readjudicated the claim fully on the merits, thereby implicitly finding that new and relevant evidence had been received. The Board is bound by the implicit finding that sufficient evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims on the merits, and need not address whether new and relevant evidence has been received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), and a July 2023 rating decision returned the claims to the AOJ to correct duty to assist errors. The January 2024 rating decision on appeal continued the denial of service connection for chloracne, and the March 2024 rating decision on appeal continued the denial of service connection for CAD.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, regarding the claim for service connection for CAD, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Regarding the claim for service connection for chloracne, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. Id. Any evidence submitted after the rating decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, as the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for acne, any evidence the Board could not consider with respect to that claim, shall be considered by the AOJ in adjudication the claim on remand.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for the diseases set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 1116, if a Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during a qualifying period of active military service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e). CAD and chloracne are both diseases associated with herbicide exposure. Id. Presumptive service connection for CAD may be granted if CAD becomes manifest to a compensable degree at any time after separation from service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD).

The Veteran seeks service connection for CAD, asserting he was exposed to herbicides while serving aboard the USS Hancock, and his CAD is related to this herbicide exposure. See January 2012 VA Form 21-526; September 2015 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2019 VA Form 20-0995; October 2022 VA Form 20-0996; January 2025 VA Form 10182.

The AOJ found the Veteran has a current disability, as the evidence shows he is diagnosed with CAD. See July 2023 Rating Decision; March 2024 Rating Decision. In a January 2024 decision that denied service connection for benign prostate hypertrophy, the Board favorably found the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving aboard the USS Hancock. See January 2024 Board Decision. These findings are binding on the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The question on appeal is whether the Veteran's CAD manifested to a compensable degree. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e). Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005 states CAD is rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, which assigns a minimal compensable 10 percent rating for CAD causing a workload of 7.1 to 10.0 metabolic equivalents levels (METs) resulting in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication required for control. See 38 C.F.R. 4.104. Thus, to be presumptively service connected, the Veteran's CAD must cause a workload of less than 10.0 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms; or require continuous medication for control. Id.

The Veteran claimed his CAD started in 2004 or 2005 with symptoms of high blood pressure, chest pain, shortness of breath, and vision changes. See March 2021 VA Examination; January 2024 VA Examination. The Veteran indicated his symptoms worsened, so he underwent a stress test and was diagnosed with CAD. See March 2021 VA Examination. The Veteran stated he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in August 2009 and experienced some post-operative complications with his lungs. Id. The Veteran's current symptoms are chest pain and shortness of breath occasionally, and he reported that he can feel the chest pain in his jaw sometimes. Id.

Veterans are competent to provide evidence of that which they experience, including symptoms and medical history. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay people are competent to describe visible or otherwise observable symptoms of disability. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran is competent to observe that he began experiencing high blood pressure, chest pain, shortness of breath, and vision changes in 2004 or 2005, and to report that he was diagnosed with CAD and underwent a CABG operation in August 2009. If lay evidence is competent, the Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The Veteran's competent statements are credible because they are consistent with other evidence. The Veteran's competent, credible lay statements therefore constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.

Service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect complaints, treatment, or diagnoses related to CAD and do not provide METs results for the Board to consider. See STRs received July 2014. Therefore, STRs do not weigh in favor of or against service connection for CAD.

VA treatment records note the Veteran has been diagnosed with CAD since he established care at the VA in March 2011 and reflect that the Veteran takes continuous medication to control his heart condition. See CAPRI received January 2024. A November 2019 cardiology stress test indicates the Veteran's cardiac functional status is equivalent to 8 METs. Id. At the Veteran's October 2020 pre-operative assessment prior to his carpal tunnel surgery, the Veteran's cardiac functional status was assessed as "greater than 4 METs." Id. VA treatment records support a finding that the Veteran's CAD has become manifest to a compensable degree, as the Veteran's CAD results in a workload less than 10.0 METs and requires continuous medication to control. See 38 C.F.R. 4.104, DC 7005. Thus, VA treatment records are highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.

The Board notes that the Veteran reported CAD onset in 2004 or 2005, and he underwent an August 2009 CABG surgical procedure to treat his CAD, but the records diagnosing CAD and showing the August 2009 CABG surgery are not shown in the claims file. See CAPRI received January 2024. It is unclear if the AOJ attempted to obtain treatment records from the medical providers who diagnosed CAD and performed the CABG, so the Board acknowledges there may be additional medical evidence supporting the Veteran's claim. However, as this decision grants the benefit sought on appeal, the Board need not remand to afford the AOJ an opportunity to obtain those records.

A March 2021 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with CAD and found that continuous medication is required to control the Veteran's CAD. See March 2021 VA Examination. The examiner explained CAD is caused by plaque building up in the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, and the plaque is made up of cholesterol deposits. Id. Over time, the plaque buildup narrows the arteries. Id. The diagnosis and assessment of CAD were based on an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's records, and the examiner supported their conclusions with citations to the diagnostic testing, treatment records, and lay statements reviewed. See Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Therefore, the March 2021 VA examination constitutes highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.

A March 2021 VA opinion found CAD less likely than not related to herbicide exposure because there was no evidence to support herbicide exposure. Id. However, the examiner did not have the benefit of reviewing the November 2023 VA memorandum confirming herbicide exposure or the January 2024 Board decision that favorably found the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving aboard the USS Hancock. See November 2023 VA Memo; January 2024 Board Decision. The opinion's rationale is based on factual inaccuracies. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The opinion is inconsistent with the other probative evidence. Accordingly, the March 2021 VA opinion is afforded no probative weight.

A December 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with CAD, indicating the presence of plaque buildup in the arteries, and hyperlipidemia, angina, and a cardiac arrhythmia. See January 2024 VA Examination. The examination conducted interview-based METs testing and concluded the Veteran's CAD results in a workload of 3 to 5 METs. Id. The examination further noted that the Veteran's CAD requires continuous medication for control. Id. In the January 2024 VA opinion, the examiner opined the Veteran's CAD is at least as likely as not related to herbicide exposure during service. See January 2024 VA Examination. The examination and opinion were based on an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's diagnostic testing, treatment records, and lay statements. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008); Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124 (2007). Thus, the December 2023 VA examination and January 2024 VA opinion constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim.

On balance, the probative evidence weighs in favor of finding the Veteran is diagnosed with CAD, the Veteran was exposed to herbicides while serving aboard the USS Hancock, and the Veteran's CAD manifested to a compensable degree. Accordingly, presumptive service connection for coronary artery disease is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Board shall remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Service connection for acne (claimed as chloracne).

The Veteran seeks service connection for chloracne, asserting he was exposed to herbicides while serving aboard the USS Hancock, and his chloracne is related to this herbicide exposure. See January 2012 VA Form 21-526; September 2015 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2019 VA Form 20-0995; October 2022 VA Form 20-0996; January 2025 VA Form 10182.

The AOJ found the Veteran has a current disability, as the evidence shows he is diagnosed with acne. See July 2023 Rating Decision; March 2024 Rating Decision. In a January 2024 decision that denied service connection for benign prostate hypertrophy, the Board favorably found the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving on the USS Hancock. See January 2024 Board Decision. These findings are binding on the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The questions on appeal are: 1) whether the Veteran's acne is consistent with chloracne and therefore presumptively service connected due to the Veteran's in-service herbicide agent exposure, and 2) whether acne became manifest to a compensable degree within one year from the Veteran's July 1971 separation from service. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6)(ii), 3.309(e). DC 7828 for acne and DC 7829 for chloracne assign a compensable rating when the Veteran experiences "deep" acne, defined as "deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts," affecting less than 40 percent of the face and neck, or deep acne other than on the face and neck. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. "Superficial" acne, defined as "comedones, papules, pustules," is not compensable. Id. 

Remand is necessary to obtain an adequate VA examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4), 20.802 (a). The Veteran was afforded March 2021 and January 2024 VA examinations and March 2023, July 2023, and January 2024 VA medical opinions. The examinations and opinions are not adequate. When VA undertakes to examine a Veteran, VA is obligated to ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21. Vet. App. 303 (2007).

The March 2021 VA examination is inadequate. A medical examination that does not provide an etiological opinion is inadequate. Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). At the March 2021 VA examination, the Veteran stated he began experiencing acne in October 1970, and acne has recurred on and off since then. See March 2021 VA Examination. The examiner diagnosed acne but indicated the Veteran has only superficial acne, not deep acne, noting the presence of a 1cm by 0.5cm intact pustule on the lower back and a 0.7cm by 0.5cm intact pustule on the cheek. Id. The examiner did not indicate whether the Veteran's acne was consistent with chloracne, did not explain the difference between superficial acne and deep acne, and did not state why the Veteran's acne is better described as "pustules" than "nodules." Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. §4.118, DC 7828-7829. The examiner also did not provide an etiological opinion regarding acne. Id. Thus, the March 2021 VA examination is inadequate. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008).

The March 2023 and July 2023 VA medical opinions are inadequate. An opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The opinions found the Veteran's acne is less likely than not related to in-service herbicide exposure, finding there is no evidence in the claims file to support herbicide exposure. See May 2023 VA Examination, July 2023 VA Examination. However, the examiners did not have the benefit of reviewing the November 2023 VA memorandum confirming herbicide exposure or the January 2024 Board decision that favorably found the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving aboard the USS Hancock. See November 2023 VA Memo; January 2024 Board Decision. The examiners also failed to consider the lay statements, photographs, and medical literature submitted by the Veteran showing that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving aboard the USS Hancock. See September 2012 VA Form 21-4138; September 2012 Correspondence; September 2012 Photographs; September 2015 Photograph; September 2015 Correspondence; December 2020 Logbooks; February 2021 VA Form 21-0820. The March 2023 and July 2023 VA medical opinions' rationales are based on factual inaccuracies and are therefore inadequate. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461 (1993). 

The January 2024 VA medical examination and opinion is inadequate. A medical opinion "must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions." Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with acne, indicating the Veteran has superficial acne on his chin. See January 2024 VA Examination. The examiner stated acne is not a condition associated with herbicide exposure, emphasizing the Veteran's diagnosis of acne, as opposed to chloracne. See 38 C.F.R. 3.307 (a)(6); 3.309(e). However, the rationale did not explain the differences between acne and chloracne and did not disclose how the examiner determined that the Veteran's acne is not consistent with chloracne. See January 2024 VA Examination. The examiner also did not offer a rationale for their conclusion that the Veteran's acne clearly and unmistakably preexisted service. Id. Additionally, the opinion is inadequate because the rationale relied on the absence of treatment records without consideration of the Veteran's competent reports. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 48-49 (2007). The examiner explained that the Veteran's STRs are silent for complaints, treatment or diagnoses related to acne but did not consider the Veteran's competent, credible lay statements describing acne during service. See January 2024 VA Examination. Consequently, the January 2024 VA examination and medical opinion is inadequate. See Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124 (2007); Dalton, 21 Vet. App. at 48-49 (2007).

For the above reasons, the AOJ committed pre-decisional error in obtaining, and relying upon, inadequate medical examinations and opinion. Consequently, remand is necessary to remedy pre-decisional error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding treatment records relevant to the Veteran's acne. 

2. After associating any treatment records with the claims file, schedule the Veteran for an in-person VA examination to ascertain the nature and etiology of acne. The entire claims file and a copy of this Remand must be reviewed by the examiner.

If the examiner determines that the Veteran's acne is not consistent with chloracne, the examiner must explain the basis for the differentiation.

3. After reviewing the record and conducting an in-person examination of the Veteran, the examiner must provide an opinion addressing whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's acne had its onset in, or is otherwise related to his period of active-duty service, to include directly due to herbicide exposure? Why or why not?

Provide a rationale to support all opinions. In providing the requested opinions, consider the Veteran's lay statements describing in-service and post-service symptoms.
