REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1970 to April 1986.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected to appeal the issues listed above and requested a hearing before the Board and an opportunity to submit evidence. 

On December 11, 2024, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing request. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the withdrawal, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(b), 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §?7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II.

2. Entitlement to service connection for colon adenocarcinoma, to include as due to diabetes mellitus type II.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for the above disabilities which he asserts are related to service. See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

One of the effects of the modernized appeal system is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board may remand appeals to the AOJ. The Board must remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error, or for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In the July 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II and colon adenocarcinoma. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

In May 2024, the Veteran was provided VA examinations for diabetes mellitus and intestinal conditions. The VA examiner referenced medical records concerning the Veteran's claimed conditions which are not currently associated with the Veteran's claims file. Specifically, the VA examiner noted test result from February and April 2024. The VA examiner also noted medical records from March and May 2023. The Board notes that these records were not listed as evidence considered by the July 2024 AOJ.

As such, VA was on notice of the existence of medical records relevant to the matter at issue but did not satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran in obtaining such records. Such pre-decisional duty to assist error requires remand for correction. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

3. Entitlement to service connection for diabetic nephropathy, to include as secondary to diabetes mellitus type II.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for diabetic nephropathy is inextricably intertwined with the issues remanded herein. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two or more issues are inextricably intertwined if one claim could have significant impact on the other).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Take appropriate steps to obtain all medical records referenced by the April 2024 VA examiner. Then document all efforts taken to obtain these records.
