ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle condition is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left ankle condition was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability was not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The Veteran's right ankle condition was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability was not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left ankle disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right ankle disorder are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2019 to November 2022. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle condition 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle condition

The Veteran contends his right and left ankle conditions are due to his active service. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any ankle complaints or diagnoses. There are no post-service medical records that show the Veteran has complained or received treatment for an ankle condition. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA ankle condition examination and opinion in December 2023. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral ankle strains. The Veteran reported bilateral ankle pain beginning in 2019 due to frequent hiking and rucking during bootcamp. The examiner found the Veteran's diagnoses impact his ability to perform occupational tasks with difficulty bending, lifting, sitting, and standing or walking for prolonged periods of time. 

The examiner rendered negative nexus opinions for both ankles. In the rationale, the examiner stated the Veteran reported bilateral ankle pain beginning in 2019 due to frequent hiking and rucking during bootcamp. The Veteran's medical records are silent regarding complaints of ankle pain or a diagnosis of an ankle condition in service or after service. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). 

While the Veteran believes his bilateral ankle disorder was related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, he does not have the training or credentials to provide a competent nexus opinion in this case. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4. Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence failing to show a relationship to service in denying this claim.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection for the Veteran's left and right ankle conditions is warranted; rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for both claims. See Lynch, 21 F.4th 781-82.
