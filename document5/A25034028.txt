REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to radiation exposure, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1970 to March 1973.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to radiation exposure, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his hypertension is due to his service. Specifically, he asserts that he "started to have BP issues many years ago, without known etiology...he has been on medications for the condition for many years." See October 2023 VA Examination Report.

In an October 2023 VA exam, the examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension "was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies)."  He reasoned that "Radiation exposures do not lead to HTN or hearing loss...there is no pathophysiological relationship therefore the HTN and hearing loss are less likely than not related to Veteran's TERA."  The Board finds this opinion inadequate as the opinion is conclusory.  Specifically, the examiner has failed to explain whether medical literature or studies were considered in formulation of the opinion.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) ("A medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two").  As such, the opinion is inadequate.  This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Board notes that the Veteran has changed his main theory of entitlement and requested remand on the basis of a new theory of secondary service connection.  See January 13, 2025, Informal Hearing Presentation.  Under the AMA, the Board may only remand for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error or errors in satisfying regulatory or statutory duties.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). However, because the Board is remanding for a pre-decisional duty to assist error in the October 2023 VA exam, the AOJ must consider any additional evidence and arguments outside of the AMA evidence window and adjudicate them with the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from the October 2023 VA examiner addressing the Veteran's claimed hypertension, to include as due to radiation exposure.

(A) The clinician must address whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension is related to his toxic exposure risk activities, to include his presumed radiation exposure for seven years as a dental technician?  

In answering this question, the clinician must consider the following: 1) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and 2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinion rendered, including references to medical literature considered.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she should explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
