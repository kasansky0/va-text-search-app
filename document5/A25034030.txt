ORDER

An effective date of January 2, 2013, for entitlement to a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence is granted. 

An effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

An effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is granted.

An effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran continuously pursued his increased rating claim for gastrointestinal issues, to include fecal incontinence, and, since January 2, 2013, the Veteran's fecal incontinence has been manifested by extensive leakage and fairly frequent involuntary bowel movements. 

2. Since January 2, 2013, the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation due to the Veteran's service-connected fecal incontinence disability. 

3. Since January 2, 2013, the Veteran has a permanent and total disability due to the grant of TDIU. 

4. Since January 2, 2013, the Veteran's service-connected fecal incontinence disability has been rated as totally disabling, and the Veteran has other service-connected disabilities independently rated as 60 percent disabling. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date for fecal incontinence have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7332-7335. 

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C.   §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1023, 3.340, 3.341, 3.2500, 4.16, 4.19. 

3. The criteria for an earlier effective date for DEA have been met.  38 U.S.C.      §§ 3500, 3501, 5102, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3020, 21.3021. 

4. The criteria for an earlier effective date for SMC based on housebound status have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Marines from February 1999 to July 2003. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in an October 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As an initial matter, the Board has recharacterized the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date for TDIU to include an earlier effective date for an increased rating for fecal incontinence, noting that VA has a duty to consider the "general lenity rule" in determining the scope of the claim based on the Veteran's filings and evidence of record.  See Murphy v. Wilkie, 983 F.3d 1313, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (stating "the VA must determine all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations, regardless of [the claim's label]") (quoting Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). 

Further, "[a] sympathetic reading of the appellant's pleadings cannot be based on a standard that requires legal sophistication beyond that which can be expected of a lay claimant and consider whether the appellant's submissions, considered in toto, have articulated a claim."  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (quoting Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256 (2007)).  The Board also notes that, between October 2017 and September 2019, the period in which the Veteran was awarded a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence, effective January 4, 2017, and filed a supplemental claim seeking a TDIU, the Veteran was unrepresented and experiencing periods of homelessness. 

Here, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for a TDIU is intertwined with the earlier effective date for a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence, as the Veteran has been seeking a TDIU based on the severity of his gastrointestinal issues since January 2, 2013, as part of his claim for an increased rating for fecal incontinence. 

Earlier Effective Dates 

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C.     § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for service connection or a claim reopened after final adjudication, "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998); Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992).  Thus, for the period prior to March 24, 2015, any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that a valid claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form.  79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015).  The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.157.  This amendment however applies only to claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Id. at 57,686. 

Under the AMA, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim following notice of a decision by the AOJ or the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date for continuously pursued claims will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision.  For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the Board issues notice of the decision the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(h)(2). 

Under the AMA, all continuous pursuit options apply to challenge an effective date, including filing a supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence.  See Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024). 

Here, the procedural history shows that, on January 2, 2013, the Veteran filed a claim seeking an increased rating for "gastritis," also claimed as Crohn's disease.  At the time, the Veteran was service connected for fecal incontinence, also claimed as anal fissure with hemorrhoids and anal leakage, at 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003. 

In December 2013, the RO denied service connection for Crohn's disease due to missed examinations, and the Veteran subsequently requested to have the examinations rescheduled.  In June 2014, the RO again denied service connection for Crohn's disease, and the Veteran again requested that the examinations be rescheduled.  The Veteran also added that this claim was related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). 

In July 2015, the RO denied service connection for IBS, and in February 2016, the Veteran requested that his claim for service connection for IBS be reopened.  In June 2016, the RO denied service connection for IBS, and in July 2016, the Veteran requested reconsideration of the claim, submitting new medical records in July 2016, detailing the Veteran's hemorrhoid surgery, continued fecal incontinence, and confirmation of the Veteran's IBS diagnosis.  In September 2016, the RO again denied service connection for IBS. 

In November 2016, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) with the denial for service connection and/or evaluation of digestive condition, claimed as both IBS and hemorrhoids, and, in November 2016, the RO issued a Statement of the Case (SOC).  In December 2016, the Veteran filed a VA Form 9. 

In January 2017, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940, seeking entitlement to TDIU due to the worsening of his disabilities, and, in January 2017, the RO issued a letter stating that entitlement to TDIU is part of the IBS appeal.  In March 2017, the RO denied entitlement to TDIU and denied an increased rating for anal fissures with hemorrhoids (now characterized as fecal incontinence).  In April 2017, the Veteran filed a NOD for IBS and TDIU, and, in August 2018, the Veteran selected the RAMP Opt-In for Higher Level Review. 

In October 2018, the RO granted service connection for IBS, rated as 30 percent disabling, effective December 27, 2013, and a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence, effective January 4, 2017.  However, the RO denied entitlement to TDIU. 

In July 2019, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, along with a vocational assessment, seeking readjudication of TDIU.  In December 2019, the RO again denied entitlement to a TDIU.  

In May 2020, the Veteran filed another supplemental claim, along with a VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  In November 2020, the RO again denied entitlement to a TDIU. 

In November 2020, the Veteran again filed a request for a higher-level review, and, in December 2020, a duty to assist error was identified.  In July 2021, the RO granted entitlement to a TDIU, SMC based on housebound status, and DEA eligibility benefits, effective May 4, 2020.  In July 2022, the Veteran sought a higher-level review of the effective date for TDIU, and, in August 2022, the RO identified a duty to assist error. 

And, finally, in January 2023, the RO granted an effective date of January 4, 2017, for TDIU, SMC based on housebound status, and DEA eligibility benefits, the date the Veteran first filed a VA Form 21-8940. 

1. An effective date of January 2, 2013, for a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence is granted. 

As noted above, the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence is before the Board to fully and sympathetically develop the Veteran's claims. 

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued this claim since January 2, 2013, the date the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his gastrointestinal issues.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  In so finding, the Board finds that, from January 2, 2013, a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence is warranted. 

The Veteran's fecal incontinence is rated under 7335-7332.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating requires use of an additional rating criteria to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.

The version of DC 7335 in effect at the close of the record (i.e., prior to May 19, 2024) directs rating pursuant to DC 7332.  Therefore, the disability is rated under the criteria set forth in DC 7332, which provides as follows:

A noncompensable disability rating is assigned for impairment of sphincter control "[h]ealed or slight, without leakage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7332.  A 10 percent disability rating is provided for "constant slight, or occasional moderate leakage."  Id.  A 30 percent disability rating is provided for "[o]ccasional involuntary bowel movements, necessitating wearing of pad."  Id.  A 60 percent disability rating is provided for "[e]xtensive leakage and fairly frequent involuntary bowel movements."  Id.  A 100 percent disability rating is provided for "complete loss of sphincter control."  Id.  

Effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the criteria for rating digestive system disabilities, including Diagnostic Codes 7332 and 7335. 

Diagnostic Code 7335 pertains to ano, fistula in, including anorectal fistula and anorectal abscess.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7335.  One fistula with drainage and pain, but without abscess warrants a 10 percent rating.  Id.  Two or more simultaneous fistulas with drainage and pain, but without abscesses warrants a 20 percent rating.  Id.  One or two simultaneous fistulas, with abscess, drainage, and pain warrants a 40 percent rating.  Id.  And more than two constant or near-constant fistulas with abscesses, drainage, and pain, which are refractory to medical and surgical treatment warrants a 60 percent rating.  Id. 

Diagnostic Code 7332 pertains to impaired sphincter control of the rectum and anus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7332.  Under Diagnostic Code 7332, complete or partial loss of sphincter control characterized by incontinence or retention that is fully responsive to a physician-prescribed bowel program and requires digital stimulation, medication (beyond laxative use), and special diet; or incontinence to solids and/or liquids two or more times per month, which requires wearing a pad two or more times per month is assigned a 30 percent rating.  Id. 

Complete or partial loss of sphincter control characterized by incontinence or retention that is partially responsive to a physician-prescribed bowel program and requires either surgery or digital stimulation, medication (beyond laxative use), and special diet; or incontinence to solids and/or liquids two or more times per week, which requires wearing a pad two or more times per week is assigned a 60 percent rating.  Id. 

Complete loss of sphincter control characterized by incontinence or retention that is not responsive to a physician-prescribed bowel program and requires either surgery or digital stimulation, medication (beyond laxative use), and special diet; or incontinence to solids and/or liquids two or more times per day, which requires changing a pad two or more times per day is assigned a total, 100 percent rating.  Id. 

Generally, if a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim or an appeal, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the Veteran.  In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation.  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  The Board must generally apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change. 

VA, thus, must consider the claim for a higher rating pursuant to the former and revised regulations during the latter part of this appeal.  See VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997).  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to May 19, 2024, and both the old and new rating criteria from May 19, 2024.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. 

Notably, the Board finds there is no evidence of symptoms that warrant a change in the code listing at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14, 4.113, 4.114; Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 351 (1992) (to determine whether a diagnostic code listing is analogous to a claimant's condition, VA should consider the functions affected by the condition, the location of the condition, and the similarity of the symptoms of each condition). 

Turning to the evidence, during a January 2003 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran was previously treated for anal ulcers in 2001 and 2002 and that he continues to report soiling and decrease in his sphincter control.  

In an April 2009 VA examination, the Veteran reported a history of recurrent diarrhea since 2002 and reports loose diarrhea 5-6 times a day.  He reported pain, tenesmus, and perianal discharge, which are all symptoms he has experienced since an episode of anal fissures in service.  The Veteran reported that chronic diarrhea, hemorrhoids, and anal pain affect his daily functioning, as he spends most of his day on the toilet and tries to be near a place with a toilet. 

In a May 2016 VA examination, the Veteran reported gas and watery/ bloody stool and that he feels an attack with stress every two weeks, and in a July 2016 private opinion, a private examiner reported performing an anoscopy with external hemorrhoidectomy, finding enlarged internal and external hemorrhoids, as well as mild rectal prolapse.  The private examiner stated that the Veteran has extensive anal leakage and fairly frequent involuntary bowel movements. 

The Board also notes that, from May 2016 to November 2016, the Veteran sought private treatment for his hemorrhoids, anal fissure, fecal incontinence, and IBS.  During a November 2016 appointment, the private physician noted that, while the Veteran reported no bleeding or hemorrhoidal prolapse post- anoscopy with hemorrhoidectomy, the Veteran continued to report fecal incontinence.  The Veteran reported his symptoms of leakage remained unchanged and that it continues to affect his daily life. 

In a September 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported a long history of bowel problems, to include bleeding with stool and incontinence.  The Veteran stated that, while in service, he required hemorrhoid surgery and has struggled with bowel incontinence since.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran continues to experience bowel urgency and incontinent leakage.  The VA examiner further noted that the Veteran experiences loose stools one to two times a day, and that, due to bowel urgency, the Veteran wears Depends and must change two to three times per day. 

Finally, in a July 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his fecal incontinence has worsened since his hemorrhoid surgery that occurred during service and that he now must use eight to nine pads per day due to leakage of feces.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran cannot function for a productive job due to frequent bathroom visits, fecal leakage, and social stigma.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's personal life has also suffered due to emotional detachment caused by the fecal incontinence, as it has affected any sexual interest. 

The Board finds the Veteran's reports regarding the severity of his fecal incontinence and resulting symptoms to be both competent and credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007)(stating that lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional).  The Veteran has consistently reported experiencing symptoms of severe fecal incontinence since at least 2003 and that it had increased in severity since then.  

As explained above, because there has been continuous pursuit of these matters since January 2, 2013, and since the 60 percent rating criteria have been met throughout the appeal period, the Board finds that January 2, 2013, is the appropriate effective date for these matters. 

Accordingly, an effective date of January 2, 2013, for fecal incontinence is warranted. 

As a final matter, the Board notes that, as this is an effective date claim, rather than an increased rating claim, the Board does not need to discuss whether the Veteran meets the criteria for a higher rating. 

2. An effective date of January 2, 2013, for TDIU is granted. 

The Veteran contends generally that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for TDIU, as he has continuously pursued his claims since January 2, 2013, and was last capable of gainful employment in November 2012.  See December 2022 Statement. 

The Veteran has consistently reported that his gastrointestinal issues, fecal incontinence, and psychiatric disabilities have prevented him from securing or maintaining substantially gainful employment.  In a January 2017 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran stated that his "chronic anal leakage and IBS attacks" caused him to stop working in 2012, and in a May 2022 and subsequent October 2022 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran stated that his service-connected disabilities, to include IBS, psychiatric disability, and back pain, caused him to stop working in November 2012. 

The Veteran's attorney argued that the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since January 2, 2013, as part and parcel of his increased rating claim for his gastrointestinal disability and should be granted an effective date of at least December 27, 2013, the effective date for the award of service connection for IBS.  The Veteran argued that, alternatively, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of July 6, 2016, as the evidence was received within one year of filing an increased rating claim.

The Veteran is service connected for fecal incontinence, rated as 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003, and 60 percent disabling now from January 2, 2013; panic disorder with agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), rated as 30 percent disabling from July 12, 2003, and 50 percent disabling from September 30, 2008; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), rated as 30 percent disabling from December 27, 2013; lumbar spine disability, rated as 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003, and 20 percent disabling from September 16, 2019; tendinitis, right shoulder, rated as 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; tendinitis, left and right ankle, both rated as 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; sinusitis, rated as 10 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; rhinitis, rated as 0 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; right testicular pain, rated as 0 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; residual scar, right forearm, rated as 0 percent disabling from July 12, 2003; and herpes simplex virus, rated as 0 percent disabling from July 12, 2003. 

Based on the most recent October 2023, Rating Decision Code sheet, the Veteran had a combined rating of 60 percent from July 12, 2003, 80 percent from September 30, 2008, 90 percent from January 4, 2017, and TDIU from January 4, 2017. 

For the following reasons, the Board finds that an effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of TDIU is warranted. 

As it pertains to effective dates, TDIU earlier effective date claims are not regulated by their own specific subsection of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Rather, such TDIU claims are equivalent to increased rating earlier effective date claims and, thus, are governed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The effective date for an award of an increased rating, including TDIU, is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C.   § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim for an increased rating, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase.  However, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of the claim.  Additionally, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2).

A TDIU rating may be granted upon a showing that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to impairment resulting from one or more service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  In general, if there is only one such disability, this disability must be rated at 60 percent or more.  Id.  If there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and the service-connected disabilities in combination result in a combined rating of 70 percent or more.  Id.  A Veteran need not show 100 percent unemployability to be entitled to TDIU.  Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In determining whether a Veteran is unemployable for VA purposes, an individualized determination specific to a Veteran's particular circumstances must be made.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014).  In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims directed the Board to consider the following factors: (1) the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  Ray, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). 

The Veteran's age and any impairment solely related to nonservice-connected disability is not to be considered.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993) (the central inquiry in determining whether a Veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether the service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability). 

And, finally, the question of whether a Veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one but rather a determination for the adjudicator.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued this claim, as explained above, and therefore, the appeal period has remained open since January 2, 2013.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). 

In so finding, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted from January 2, 2013, and, after considering the lay and medical evidence, the Board concludes that the evidence weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran has not been able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of his service-connected fecal incontinence. 

As discussed above, the Veteran has consistently reported that his gastrointestinal issues and resulting psychiatric disability have prevented him from maintaining or securing gainful employment. 

During an October 2008 VA Outpatient Center (VAOPC) mental health visit, the Veteran reported that he has two years of college credit, and, while he is unemployed, he does contract work in the computer industry.  In a separate May 2010 VAOPC primary care visit, the Veteran reported that he is a professional student at the City University of New York, studying computer engineering.  During the appointment, he stated that he was looking for work in computers.  However, in a December 2022 Statement in Support of his claim, the Veteran stated that his last date of self-employment was in November 2012.  Additionally, in Social Security Administration (SSA) records, the Veteran reported last working in February 2009 as a computer technician due to gastrointestinal-related issues. 

The Board notes that, during a period between 2012 and 2019, the Veteran experienced homelessness and participated in Health Care for Homeless Veteran Programs (HCHC) and lived in a group home for Veterans between August 2017 and July 2018.  Between May 19-21, 2019, the Veteran was hospitalized on the inpatient psychiatric unit, where the attending physician noted the Veteran's homelessness, psychiatric disabilities, history of severe gastrointestinal issues.  See May 2019 VA Hospital records. 

In a January 2017 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported that he first experienced complete loss of sphincter control during active duty and that, in 2009, his complete loss of sphincter control, combined pain, blood, and IBS attacks became so bad that he could no longer attend public functions, as the risk of public humiliation was imminent.  

In a June 2019 private opinion, a vocational consultant opined that, though the Veteran is a well-trained individual with many skills, the totality of his limitations renders participation in a substantially gainful occupation infeasible.  The consultant stated that, while an individual in our modern economy is allowed bathroom breaks during working hours, the access is limited.  Further, the consultant opined that the skilled work completed by the Veteran requires concentration, persistence, and pace, none of which the Veteran can accomplish with the interruptions experienced by the Veteran, described as needing to clean close to two hundred times per day. 

Additionally, as noted above, in a July 2021 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran cannot function at a productive job due to frequent bathroom visits, fecal leakage, and social stigma. 

The Board finds the June 2019 vocational evaluation, July 2021 VA examination and the Veteran's statements to be the most probative evidence of record.  The July 2021 VA examination, following an examination of the Veteran and review of his file, and the June 2019 vocational evaluation are consistent with the evidence of the record.  Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to give evidence of his employment history, as well as the reasons he was unable to work.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). 

Giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected fecal incontinence has rendered him unable to secure and/or follow a substantially gainful occupation since January 2, 2013. 

Accordingly, the Veteran will be awarded an earlier effective date of January 2, 2013, for the award of TDIU. 

3. An effective date of January 2, 2013, for DEA is granted. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits. 

In the March 2024 attorney brief, the Veteran's attorney stated that, as the issue of DEA benefits is inextricably intertwined with TDIU, the effective date for DEA should be the same as TDIU. 

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if a Veteran has a permanent, total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501.  A total disability may be assigned where the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the Veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341. Permanence of total disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b). 

The Veteran had a permanent and total service-connected disability since January 2, 2013, now the effective date of the grant of TDIU.  Therefore, an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is granted. 

4. An effective date of January 2, 2013, for SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C.            § 1114(s) is granted. 

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). 

In the March 2024 attorney brief, the Veteran's attorney stated that, as the issue of SMC is inextricably intertwined with TDIU, the effective date for SMC should be the same as TDIU. 

Special monthly compensation is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  The latter requirement is met when a Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disability or disabilities to his dwelling and the immediate premises (or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas), and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout the Veteran's lifetime.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

Subsection 1114(s) requires that a disabled Veteran whose disability level is determined by the ratings schedule must have at least one disability that is rated at 100 percent to qualify for the special monthly compensation provided by statute.  Under the law, subsection 1114(s) benefits are not available to a Veteran whose 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which are rated at 100 percent disabling. 

A TDIU may satisfy the requirement for a single disability rated total, if awarded on the basis of a single disability.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011).  However, an award of a TDIU based on multiple service-connected disabilities, considered one disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), is not sufficient to serve as a service-connected disability rated as total for the purposes of establishing eligibility for SMC at the housebound rate.  See Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412 (2019) (holding that a TDIU based on multiple service-connected disabilities that are considered as "one disability" under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), such as disabilities from a common etiology, may not be used to establish "a service-connected disability rated as total" for SMC eligibility pursuant to § 1114(s)). 

As discussed above, the Veteran has now been granted entitlement to a TDIU from January 2, 2013, based upon the service-connected fecal incontinence disability, as well as an effective date of January 2, 2013, for a 60 percent rating for fecal incontinence. 

As such, the Board finds that an effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is warranted.  The evidence reflects that the Veteran's TDIU is based upon a single disability - fecal incontinence - from January 2, 2013, and that the Veteran has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability.

Therefore, the claim for an effective date of January 2, 2013, for the grant of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.
