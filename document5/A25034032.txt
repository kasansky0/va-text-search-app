ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss was incurred in, or is otherwise related to, his active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1982 to June 1984. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of his bilateral hearing loss most recently addressed in a January 2023 rating decision.  In November 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, direct service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  

Direct service connection generally requires credible and competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 505 (1995).  Consistent with this framework, direct service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection may also be established for a disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 (1995). 

In order to prevail on the issue of secondary service connection, the record must show: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); See also Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374. 

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including evidence pertinent to service, establishes the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

A Veteran is presumed to be in sound condition when examined and accepted into the service except for defects or disorders noted when examined and accepted for service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137. 

To rebut the presumption of sound condition under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.  The claimant is not required to show the disease or injury increased in severity during service before VA's duty under the second prong of this rebuttal standard attaches.  Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304, 3.306(b). 

A pre-existing disease or injury will be presumed to have been aggravated by service only if the evidence shows the underlying disability underwent an increase in severity; the occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of a disability.  See Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a).

"Clear and unmistakable evidence" is a more formidable evidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence standard.  See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting the "clear and convincing" burden of proof, while a higher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a lower burden to satisfy than "clear and unmistakable evidence").  Stated another way, the standard of proof for rebutting the presumption of soundness is not merely evidence 1 "cogent and compelling, i.e., a sufficient showing, but evidence that is clear and unmistakable, i.e., undebatable..."  Id. at 261.  It is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable."  Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003) (internal citations omitted).  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F. 3rd 1391 (2021).

Direct service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Even if disabling loss is not demonstrated at separation, a Veteran may establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that a current disability is causally related to service.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hearing loss is due to his military service cleaning, laundry, and cooking on a ship where aircraft took off and landed daily.  Although his military occupational service indicates low for hazardous noise, the Veteran asserts he was around loud noise daily.    

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels (db) or greater; or when the auditory threshold for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 db or greater; or, when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

First, under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has hearing loss for VA benefits purposes.  The AOJ also conceded noise exposure while serving in the military.  

Also, service connection will be presumed for certain chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system such as sensorineural bilateral hearing loss, if manifest to a compensable degree within one year after discharge from service.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Because there is no indication that the Veteran's hearing loss was manifested to a compensable degree within one year of service, service connection is not available on a presumptive basis.    

For the first element of service connection, the Veteran has shown he has a current hearing loss disability.  Therefore, the first element is met.

For the second element, the AOJ conceded military noise exposure.  Therefore, the Veteran has met the second element for service connection.  

For the third element, the Veteran must show that his current hearing loss disability is due to the noise exposure during service.  

First, there is not an ability to establish a nexus for the third Shedden element by a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology because there are no private or VA treatment records for the Veteran's hearing loss from separation until he submitted a claim for service connection in August 2022, nearly 40 years after service.  Therefore, this theory of entitlement to service connection is unavailable.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309.

In this case, the Veteran's July 1982 Report of Medical Examination on entrance indicates the Veteran had no hearing loss.  

 	 HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	10	5	10	10

LEFT	15	5	5	10	15

At separation, the Veteran's April 1984 Report of Medical Examination indicates the following:  

 	 HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	10	15	15	25

LEFT	15	10	10	15	25

Also, the Board notes that service treatment records (STRs) indicate the Veteran sought treatment for "clogged ears" in October 1983 and April 1984.  However, the Veteran had ear wax build up and was treated.

Nearly 40 years after separation, the Veteran underwent an October 2022 VA audiological examination after submitting his August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ claim.  However, the examiner determined the examination was inadequate for rating purposes for VA.  Puretone thresholds, in decibels, are as follows:

 	 HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	80	75	85	85	100

LEFT	70	90	90	100	100

Speech recognition ability using the Maryland CNC test is 100 percent in the right ear and 100 percent in the left ear.

The examiner concluded Puretone thresholds were not valid for rating purposes because the Veteran responded to recorded speech at a much lower decibel level compared to Puretone thresholds and indicated a nonorganic hearing loss.  

The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hearing loss is less likely than not caused by his military service and hearing loss was exaggerated on the right and left ears.  Also, the Veteran did not report he had hearing loss at the evaluation.  

The Veteran next underwent a September 2023 VA hearing loss examination which shows a diagnosis of hearing loss.  Puretone thresholds, in decibels, are as follows:

 	 HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	20	20	60	65

LEFT	10	20	25	65	65

Speech recognition ability using the Maryland CNC test is 96 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear.

The September 2023 VA examiner noted the Veteran had no complaints, treatment or diagnosis of hearing loss from discharge until the August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ claim form was submitted.  The examiner also noted that post separation, the Veteran was exposed to occupational noise over a long period of time.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's Navy MOS of ship's serviceman had a low probability for hazardous noise in 1982-1984 Peacetime duty.  And, per objective audiometric results from enlistment to separation, there is no evidence of a permanent positive threshold shift (worse than reference threshold) greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500-6000 Hz for either left or right ear.  The examiner also concluded the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by or a result of his military service.

The Veteran reported he did not need ear plugs to sleep on the ship, but did report his work area was beneath the flight deck.  Also, the Veteran reported post-service work around heavy machinery and power tools and did not use hearing protection.  Post-service work was in highway construction, an auto detailing business, installing metal buildings, moving furniture, and worked in shipping for a machine company.  The Veteran denied daily hearing loss is a bother or that it interfered with daily living activities.   

The Veteran also submitted August 2022 and June 2023 lay statements.  He reports that he was around hazardous noise when he worked in the laundry and did not use hearing protection.  

The Veteran also submitted June 2024 argument.  He reports that he did not enter service with perfect hearing, and it worsened in the two years he served.  He also argues that his service-connected tinnitus is due to his bilateral hearing loss and that they are inextricably mixed.

Taken all together, the Board finds the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim and in favor of the VA examiners who reviewed his file thoroughly, examined the Veteran and spoke with him about his hearing loss.  First, the Veteran's DD 214 shows no specific MOS for the Veteran.  However, he reports that his MOS was as a cook, laundry, and service in an area under the flight deck on a ship, which caused in-service noise exposure, and which is conceded by the AOJ.  However, even if the Veteran was exposed to noise during service, this is not the same as having sustained the type of injury that causes both chronic hearing loss and having a resulting chronic disability.  As for the shift in hearing at separation, the Veteran's VA examiner in September 2023 indicated that there is no evidence of a permanent positive threshold shift (worse than reference threshold) greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500-6000 Hz for either left or right ear at separation nor did he indicate any hearing issues at separation.  See also, April 1984, Report of Medical Examination.  

As for the argument that the Veteran entered service with hearing loss, this argument fails as his entry and exit examinations provide no evidence that he was not presumed sound.  A Veteran is presumed to be in sound condition when examined and accepted into the service except for defects or disorders noted when examined and accepted for service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 1137.  The Board notes he had complaints about "clogged ears" and was diagnosed with wax buildup in his ears.  See STRs, October 1983, January 1984, Apri 1984.  Most importantly, the Veteran acknowledges he had many years post-service work where he was exposed to power tools, heavy machinery, auto detailing work, and did not use hearing protection.  Also, as for the argument that his bilateral hearing loss is secondary to his service connected tinnitus, VA examiners gave no positive nexus that the tinnitus caused the bilateral hearing loss.  

The Board finds that although the Veteran has a current disability of hearing loss, he did not seek treatment, complain, or have a diagnosis until nearly 40 years after service.  In this case, the Board finds the weight of the evidence is against hearing loss due to his military service.

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
