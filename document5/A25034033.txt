FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's asthma has not manifested as FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids or worse symptoms, and sleep apnea has not manifested as chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or; requires tracheostomy. 

2. The Veteran's lumbosacral strain has not manifested as forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less or ankylosis of the spine or the functional equivalent of those symptoms.

3. During the period on appeal, radiculopathy, left lower extremity did not more closely approximate moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

4. During the period on appeal, radiculopathy, right lower extremity did not more closely approximate moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for asthma have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.10, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602-6847.

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5237.

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.124a, DC 8520.

4. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.124a, DC 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1994 to September 1998 and from March 2003 to June 2003. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 decision. In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 decision. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 decision.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Nevertheless, where the evidence contains factual findings that show a change in the severity of symptoms during the course of the rating period on appeal, assignment of staged ratings would be permissible. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea/asthma.

The Veteran has a combined 50 percent rating for obstructive sleep apnea and asthma from November 30, 2021. Prior to the April 2025 rating decision, the Veteran was in receipt of a 30 percent rating for asthma only. The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for asthma on January 10, 2023.  Under 38 CFR 4.96(a), when there are coexisting respiratory disabilities for which multiple evaluations cannot be assigned a single rating will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability, and that evaluation will be elevated to the next higher evaluation, when the severity of the overall disability warrants it.

The Veteran's disability is evaluated under DC 6602, evaluating bronchial asthma.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  These rating criteria are based on pulmonary function test (PFT) results and medication required for control.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication.  Id.  

A 60 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least 3 times per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.  

A maximum 100 percent rating is assigned for an FEV-1 of less than 40 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, more than 1 attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications.  These calculations are collectively known as pulmonary function tests (PFTs).  In the absence of clinical findings of asthma at the time of an examination, a verified history of asthmatic attacks must be of record.  Id. at Note (1). 

For DC 6602, the pertinent regulations do not stipulate whether to apply the results from pre-bronchodilator PFT tests or post-bronchodilator PFT tests.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97(d).  The Board will apply whichever test yields the lowest values.   

Under DC 6847, a 50 percent rating is warranted for the use of breathing assistance device such as a CPAP machine; a 100 percent rating is warranted for chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or requires tracheostomy. 

The Veteran underwent a VA asthma examination in January 2022. Pre-bronchodilator FEV-1 was 129 percent, and post-bronchodilator was 132 percent. The Veteran had no physician visits for required care of exacerbations. Her asthma did not require use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications. 

The Veteran underwent a VA sleep apnea examination in April 2022. The Veteran's symptoms did not include chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or required tracheostomy. The Veteran used a CPAP machine. 

The Veteran underwent a VA sleep apnea examination in March 2023. The Veteran's symptoms did not include chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or required tracheostomy. The Veteran used a CPAP machine.

VA and private treatment records are similarly silent for any symptoms which reach the level of disability anticipated by the 60 percent rating for asthma or the 100 percent rating for obstructive sleep apnea. In sum, the Board finds the evidence of record is persuasively against an increased rating for obstructive sleep apnea/asthma under any DC. 

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or § 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Effective February 7, 2021, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended. Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, Fed. Reg. 76,453, 76,463 (Nov. 30, 2020). These amendments revised certain DCs "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities." Id.

The Veteran contends that her lumbosacral strain warrants a higher rating. The Veteran's lumbosacral strain is rated under DC 5237, which directs that the disability be rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Rating Formula), which provides for assignment of a separate rating for any associated objective neurological abnormalities. The identified ratings are to be assigned with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by the residuals of injury or disease. The February 2021 amendments did not affect DC 5237.

The Board notes at the outset that the Veteran was not found to have intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), DC 5243, of the thoracolumbar spine at any point during the period on appeal, thus the General Rating Formula is for application.

Under the General Rating Formula, a 20 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

A 40 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id.

A 50 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for ankylosis of the entire spine. Id.

Normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees. Id. at Note (2).

The Veteran has a 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain from March 8, 2018. She filed a claim for an increased rating on January 10, 2023. The relevant period for review also includes the one- year look-back period for increased rating claims. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The Board notes the Veteran failed to attend an April 2023 VA lumbar spine examination. No good cause has been shown for her absence; therefore, a new examination is not required. 

Private treatment records document the Veteran received bilateral sacroiliac joint injections which alleviated bilateral glute pain. A December 2022 private treatment record documented the Veteran's report of no low back pain, but she experienced occasional minimal discomfort localized to the bilateral PSIS region without radiation. Imagining showed mild disc bulging and facet joint arthropathy. 

The Board has considered the effects of medications on the Veteran's lumbosacral strain. The evidence of record does not show that with or without medication the Veteran's lumbosacral strain more closely approximated forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. See Ingram v. Collins No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (March 12, 2025). For example, a September 2022 private treatment record documented the Veteran did not find April 2022 bilateral sacroiliac joint steroid injections to be very helpful. She had previously tried physical therapy, a chiropractor, and radiofrequency of the sacroiliac joints without long-term relief. Yet, the only symptoms noted was pain and tenderness to palpation. 

During November 2022 private treatment, prior to an injection, the Veteran was found to have no tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, and her gait was non-antalgic. She reported worsening pain in the upper gluteal region, but she did not report any restricted range of motion or an inability to move the spine. She worked as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) throughout the appeal period, and this is a job that typically requires bending, twisting, and moving the spine. 

VA treatment record similarly document pain in the lumbar spine, but there is no evidence to support a severely reduced range of motion before or after medication. 

The Board acknowledges that a claimant may obtain "an evaluation based on ankylosis if [that] claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis...." See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 11 (2021). However, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted because the lay and medical evidence together does not support a finding of ankylosis or its functional equivalent. The Veteran has not reported any symptomology which would more closely approximates ankylosis. Thus, a higher rating for favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine is not warranted.

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain did not more nearly approximate forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine at any point during the appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5237.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity radiculopathy.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity radiculopathy.

Each lower extremity is rated as 10 percent disabling from March 8, 2018, under DC 8520.

Under DC 8520, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild, incomplete paralysis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate, incomplete paralysis. A 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The terms "mild, "moderate," and "severe" used in DC 8520 is not defined in this DC or elsewhere in the rating schedule in a way that might be applicable to DC 8520. In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citing Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).

In rating peripheral nerve injuries and their residuals, attention should be given to the site and character of the injury, the relative impairment in motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120; see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.123, 124. The term "incomplete paralysis," with this and other peripheral nerve injuries, indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves, Introductory Note.

The Veteran contends each extremity warrants a higher rating for radiculopathy. 

The Board notes the Veteran failed to attend an April 2023 VA peripheral nerves examination. No good cause has been shown for her absence; therefore, a new examination is not required.

A September 2022 private treatment record documented full strength in the distal lower extremities. Muscle strength reflexes were graded as -2, and seated straight leg raise was mildly positive on the right. 

An October 2022 VA review of systems documented no numbness or paresthesias. 

An April 2023 VA treatment record documented normal sensory and motor nerve conduction studies were normal bilaterally. Needle examination demonstrated mildly long-duration, high amplitude motor unit potentials in bilateral L5/S1 innervated muscles. Findings were consistent with mild chronic bilateral L5 and S1 radiculopathies. 

(Continued on the next page)

?

The Board finds the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximate mild, incomplete paralysis as she experienced a limited number of symptoms with primarily normal testing bilaterally.

The Board concludes that the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy, right and left lower extremity have not been met, and the Veteran's claims are therefore denied. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.14, 4.124a, DC 8520.
