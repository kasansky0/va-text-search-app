ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 25, 2022, for the award of service connection for atherosclerotic heart disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with acute, subacute, or old myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure; and cardiomyopathy with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (hereinafter "heart disabilities") is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's appeal was continuously pursued from January 25, 2022. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 25, 2022, for the award of service connection for heart disabilities have been met. 38 U.S.C. §1110, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1991 to November 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which was later subject to higher-level review.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 25, 2022, for the award of service connection for heart disabilities is granted.

On January 25, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for "hypertension/high blood pressure" which the RO treated as a claim for heart conditions.

In an October 2023 rating decision, service connection for the heart disabilities was granted with a disability rating of 100 percent commencing August 10, 2022, the date of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT) Act. 

The Veteran contends that he should be awarded an earlier effective date of January 25, 2022, the date on which he filed his claim. The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection on a direct basis, and not on a presumptive basis. The Board agrees. 

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during service the so-called 'nexus' requirement." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may be granted for a Persian Gulf Veteran with objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1). A qualifying chronic disability is a chronic disability that may result from an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness (MUCMI). 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i).

An undiagnosed illness requires that the illness, by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(4). Signs or symptoms that may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness or a medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) fatigue; (2) signs or symptoms involving skin; (3) headache; (4) muscle pain; (5) joint pain; (6) neurologic signs or symptoms; (7) neuropsychological signs or symptoms; (8) signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower); (9) sleep disturbances; (10) gastrointestinal signs or symptoms; (11) cardiovascular signs or symptoms; (12) abnormal weight loss; and (13) menstrual disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b).

The PACT Act was signed into law in August 2022. The PACT Act expands VA benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits or other toxic substances during military service. The PACT Act states that if several listed diseases specified become "manifest in a covered Veteran shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated during active military, naval, air, or space service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such service." The term "covered Veteran" means a Veteran who performed active military, naval, air, or space service in several countries in the Middle East or near to the Middle East. Section 405 of the PACT Act reduces the threshold for establishing eligibility when considering presumptive service connection for Persian Gulf War Veterans. Presumptive conditions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a) and (b) may now manifest to any degree at any time. There is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to December 31, 2026. The end date is no longer applicable. See PACT Act, Pub. L. 117-168, § 405.

If service connection can be granted under a different basis, such as direct service connection, the Veteran would be entitled to an effective date for the award of disability compensation earlier then the date of enactment of the PACT Act. 

Here, VA received the Veteran's initial application seeking service connection for his heart disabilities on January 25, 2022. If service connection is granted solely under the PACT Act, the earliest effective date available to the Veteran for benefits purposes would be August 10, 2022, several months after he filed his initial claim. Considering the effective date implications of the PACT Act, the Board has considered whether there is a basis other than the PACT Act to grant the Veteran's claim. 

The Board will consider service connection for the Veteran's heart disabilities as directly due to his active service. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); Combee v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 193 (1994).

Initially, the Veteran has diagnoses of for atherosclerotic heart disease; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with acute, subacute, or old myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure; and cardiomyopathy with automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The Veteran had an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in June 2022. Additionally, the Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, as defined by 38 CFR 3.317(e)(2), for at least one day between: August 2, 1990, through July 31, 1991.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for heart conditions in May 2022 to determine whether the Veteran's heart disabilities qualified as MUCMI. The VA examiner determined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's heart disabilities were related to a specific exposure event experienced by the Veteran during service in Southwest Asia. The examiner further explained that the Veteran's heart conditions were considered a diagnosable but medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness of unknown etiology.

In a November 2022 addendum opinion to the May 2022 examination, a different VA examiner opined that the Veteran's atherosclerotic heart disease was less likely than not related to a specific exposure event experienced by the Veteran during service in Southwest Asia. The examiner explained that atherosclerotic heart disease is a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis. The examiner stated that per medical records, Veteran had significant risk factors for development of atherosclerotic heart disease, to include hyperlipidemia, history of smoking, and being overweight. 

In a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's atherosclerotic heart disease was at least as likely as not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner considered the Veteran's exposure to chemical weapons, burning oil wells, other toxic substances. The examiner explained that agents used in chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf War have been linked to cause both acute toxic effects and long-term medical complications, including long-term cardiac effects. Medical literature has found exposure to these chemical weapons can cause a multitude of cardiac issues including but not limited to ischemia, cardiomyopathy effects, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. The Board finds this VA opinion to be highly probative evidence, establishing a direct relationship between the Veteran's heart disabilities and other toxic risk exposure activities during service. 

The Board notes that while there are conflicting opinions as to whether the Veteran's heart disabilities would qualify as MUCMIs, there is no medical evidence of record to refute the September 2023 VA examiner's opinion that the Veteran's heart disabilities are due to toxic exposure during active service.

As discussed above, the Board recognizes the Veteran has already been granted service connection under the PACT Act for the claimed conditions. Claims granted under the PACT Act will be effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the Act. Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022). However, the Board finds it is more advantageous to the Veteran to hereby establish that service connection for heart disabilities is granted under a direct basis. This allows for an establishment of an effective date of the date of claim for the heart disabilities, which is January 25, 2022. If the Board were to accept the prior grant under the PACT Act, then the effective date could be no earlier than the date of enactment of the new law, which is August 10, 2022. Thus, the Veteran benefits by a grant of service connection on a direct basis for his heart disability claim, which allows for an effective date back to the date of claim, January 25, 2022.

Therefore, the Board finds the claimed conditions to be a result of the Veteran's military service on a direct basis, with the effective date of January 25, 2022, the date of the initial claim for entitlement to service connection for the heart disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (providing the effective date "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor"). The appeal is granted.
