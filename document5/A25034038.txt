DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2025, prior to the Board's promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran's representative submitted a written statement indicating that the Veteran desired to withdraw the appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. 

In the April 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected to appeal the issues listed above and requested a hearing before the Board.

The record reflects that the Veteran was scheduled a Board hearing to take place on April 10, 2025. However, on March 18, 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted a written statement indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw the VA Form 10182 submitted in April 2021; specifically identifying the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, as well as the docket number 210416-153502. 

Parenthetically, the Board notes that, while this appeal was pending, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for tinnitus, which was considered a full grant of the benefit sought with respect to that disability. See June 2022 rating decision. Therefore, that claim is no longer on appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision, and withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

The requirements for making a written withdraw of an appeal are set out in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. By regulation, a veteran's "appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (a). To be effective, the "withdrawal[] must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf)." 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1). The withdrawal must also include "the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn." Id. 

When deciding whether the withdrawal is valid, the Board should ordinarily confine itself to examining the written submission to determine whether it complies with the requirements laid out in the regulation. Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2020). If the withdrawal includes the name of the veteran, the file number, and unambiguously identifies the claims to be withdrawn, then the written withdrawal will be considered valid, and the Board need not look to other evidence to find it so. Id. 

In this case, the Veteran's representative submitted written correspondence that included the Veteran's name and VA claim number and explicitly and expressed his desire to withdraw the notice of disagreement and, thus, the appeal for the issue remaining on appeal. Given that the written statement included all required information, the Board finds the written statement received in March 2025 was valid and unambiguous as to his desire to withdraw the issue on appeal.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.
