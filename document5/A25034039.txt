REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2014 to December 2017.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, as a remand of these matters is required, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

The AOJ attempted to schedule examinations in connection with these claims in October 2023, but the Veteran called to cancel them and reschedule, because he could not attend examinations scheduled for October 12, 2023. See October 11, 2023 VA 27-0820 Report of General Information; see also October 5, 2023 C&P Exam (appointment notification for tinnitus examination), received October 13, 2023. The AOJ subsequently requested additional examinations in connection with the claims. See October 17, 2023 Exam Request. The record contains November 2023 reports of no shows for the examinations but does not contain a copy of any notice that was sent to the Veteran or any information regarding the examination dates. Notably, an October 2023 notification that is of record is also not clear as to whether the Veteran is to appear in person and does not identify an address for the location of the examination. 

The Board finds that the pre-decisional record does not contain clear information as to whether the Veteran was appropriately notified of the rescheduled examinations, and the AOJ should have afforded the Veteran another opportunity to attend examinations prior to adjudicating the claims. This pre-decisional duty to assist error must be corrected on remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Reschedule the Veteran's examinations for tinnitus, left and right knee disabilities, migraines, and a low back disability. Ensure the examination notices are included in the claims file and the Veteran is notified of the address where he is to report for the examinations, if he must appear in person.
