REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1985 to October 2006.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that on the March 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran listed multiple issues stemming from 2007, 2008, and 2022 rating decisions.  These rating decisions were untimely as they were filed more than one year prior to the  Notice of Disagreement.  As such, the Board does not have jurisdiction over those issues and they will not be addressed herein. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

The primary focus in a claim for increased rating is the present level of disability.  Although the overall history of the veteran's disability shall be considered, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, a "staged" rating is warranted if the evidence demonstrates distinct periods when a service-connected disability exhibits diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings, irrespective of whether an initial or established rating.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the standard working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").  The Court has held that 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 does not require a separate rating for pain but rather provides guidance for determining ratings under other diagnostic codes assessing musculoskeletal function.  See Spurgeon v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 194 (1997).

Loss of motion due to flare-ups must be estimated by VA examiners and considered by the Board.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  Moreover, the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that VA examinations include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.  Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for residuals of right ankle sprain.

The Veteran's residuals of right ankle sprain are rated under Diagnostic Codes 5024-5271.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Here, the use of Diagnostic Codes 5024-5271 reflect that the Veteran's right ankle disability is described as tenosynovitis under Diagnostic Code 5024 and that the rating assigned is based on limitation of ankle motion under Diagnostic Codes 5271.

Relevant to the present case, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a was amended effective February 7, 2021, which added definitions to Diagnostic Code 5271 to describe what constitutes moderate and marked limitation of motion.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); Correction, 86 Fed. Reg. 8142, 8143 (Feb. 4, 2021).  

As of February 7, 2021, under the amended criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limitation of ankle motion (defined as less than 15 degrees of dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees of plantar flexion) and a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limitation of ankle motion (defined as less than 5 degrees of dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees of plantar flexion).  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

In addition to Diagnostic Code 5271, the Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all Diagnostic Codes that are potentially applicable, including Diagnostic Code 5270, which evaluates an ankle disability with ankylosis.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991).  Under Diagnostic Code 5270, a 20 percent rating is assigned for presence of plantar flexion less than 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for presence of ankylosis in plantar flexion, between 30 and 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion, between 0 and 10 degrees.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for presence of ankylosis in plantar flexion at more than 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion at more than 10 degrees, or with adduction, adduction, inversion or eversion deformity.  As indicated above, ankylosis is not limited to spinal joints, but can occur in any joint, as is reflected throughout various Diagnostic Codes within the Rating Schedule.

The normal ranges of motion of the ankle are 20 degrees of dorsiflexion and 45 degrees of plantar flexion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "moderate" and "marked."  In the absence of guidance, the Board will consider the below dictionary definitions for these subjective adjectives.  "Moderate," as an adjective, is defined as "not violent, severe, or intense"; "limited in scope or effect."  Moderate, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate, Definitions 3 and 5 (last visited Feb. 22, 2023).  "Marked," as an adjective, is defined as "having a distinctive or emphasized character."  Marked, Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked, Definition 2 (last visited January 17, 2025).

Other diagnostic codes providing ratings for ankle disabilities include: Diagnostic Code 5270 for ankylosis of the ankle; Diagnostic Code 5272 for ankylosis of the subastragalar or tarsal joint; Diagnostic Code 5273 for malunion of os calcis or astragalus; and Diagnostic Code 5274 for astragalectomy. The Veteran's right ankle has not been shown to have these conditions during the period on appeal.

A September 2023 treatment records from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center shows the Veteran's complaint of intermittent pinching sensation on the right lateral ankle happening approximately 2 to 3 times a week that was very bothersome.  He took anti-inflammatory medications as needed.  Range of motion of the right ankle consisted of dorsiflexion to 20 degrees and plantar flexion to 50 degrees.  The diagnosis was osteoarthritis of joint right ankle.

During a December 2023 VA Ankle Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire, the Veteran reported steady throbbing pain in the right ankle pain that was aggravated with stepping wrong.  He also reported flare-ups with sharp throbbing pain in the right ankle occurring every two months and lasting three to four days.  The severity of the flare-ups was described as mild, he had difficulty walking with the flare-ups.  The Veteran denied history of instability of the right ankle.  Right ankle range of motion (ROM) testing revealed that dorsiflexion was to 10 degrees and plantar flexion was to 30 degrees.  Pain was noted on examination.  Passive ROM testing revealed that dorsiflexion was to 20 degrees and plantar flexion was to 40 degrees.  There was evidence of pain with weight bearing, nonweight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, and on rest, and pain caused limitation of movement.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus.  There was moderate tenderness with palpation on the lateral malleolus.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions but there was additional loss of ROM, consisting of dorsiflexion to 5 degrees and plantar flexion was to 20 degrees, due to pain and fatigability.  The examination was not conducted after repetitive use over time or during a flare-up; however, the examiner estimated that the right ankle ROM after repetitive use over time or during a flare-up would consist of dorsiflexion was to 5 degrees and plantar flexion was to 20 degrees, due to pain and fatigability.  There were no additional factors contributing to the disability.  There was no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis.  On joint stability testing, anterior drawer test and talar tilt test were negative.  The Veteran did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion.  Magnetic resonance imaging of the right ankle revealed multiple chronic sequelae of previous medial and lateral ankle sprains including a lateral talar dome osteochondral lesion/focal osteoarthritis which appeared chronic without signs of instability and additional osteoarthritis at the medial mortise and mild distal Achilles tendinopathy.  There was no high-grade tear.  The examiner found that the Veteran's right ankle condition impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks due to pain with prolonged walking.  He currently worked as an analyst and lost 0 to 1 week work time in the past 12 months due to right ankle disability.

Based on the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the evidence as a whole does not show that symptoms of the Veteran's right ankle disability result in what may be considered marked limitation of motion of the ankle so as to in turn meet, or approximate, the requirements for a higher 20 percent rating for the ankle.  Although he has complained of ankle pain, the December 2023 VA examination showed his right ankle dorsiflexion still was to 5 degrees and plantar flexion was to 20 degrees at worst.  The Board finds that, on the whole, the degree of limited motion shown does not indicate markedly limited motion as opposed to moderately limited motion.

At no time was the Veteran's right ankle dorsiflexion less than 5 degrees or plantar flexion less than 10 degrees.  Thus, the Board finds that "marked" limitation of motion of the ankle was not present.

Thus, the Board concludes that, even with consideration of sections 4.40, 4.45, 4.59 and DeLuca, including the Veteran's complaint of right ankle pain with difficulty of prolonged walking, the record evidence as a whole presents no basis for assigning a higher 20 percent rating for the right ankle under Diagnostic Code 5271.

In Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), the Court held that the evaluation of painful motion as limited motion only applies when limitation of motion is noncompensable (meaning 0-percent disabling) under the applicable diagnostic code.  The Court explained that, although painful motion is entitled to a minimum 10 percent rating under Lichtenfels v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 484, 488 (1991), when read together with Diagnostic Code 5003 concerning arthritis, it does not follow that the maximum rating is warranted under the applicable diagnostic code pertaining to range of motion simply because pain is present throughout the range of motion.  Id.  The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's right ankle dorsiflexion was not less than 5 degrees or plantar flexion was not less than 10 degrees.  Even considering DeLuca and 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59, the level of limitation of motion required for "marked" limitation of motion was not nearly approximated. In other words, the existing 10 percent rating adequately compensates the Veteran for the right ankle pain he experiences owing to the arthritis and its effect on his range of motion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.

Consequently, the Board finds that the Veteran's right ankle disability has not manifested as marked limitation of motion such that a disability rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent right knee patellar tendinosis status post meniscal tear, limitation of extension.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee patellar tendinosis status post meniscal tear and partial lateral meniscectomy and debridement lateral femoral condyle.

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right knee patellar tendinosis status post meniscal tear, limitation of flexion.

Knee disabilities are generally rated under Diagnostic Codes 5256 through 5263 of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Diagnostic Code 5256 addresses ankylosis of the knee.  Diagnostic Code 5257 addresses recurrent subluxation or lateral instability.  Diagnostic Code 5258 addresses dislocated semilunar cartilage in the knee manifested by frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint. Diagnostic Code 5259 addresses symptomatic residuals related to removal of semilunar cartilage.  Diagnostic Code 5260 addresses limitation of motion on flexion while Diagnostic Code 5261 addresses limitation of motion on extension.  Diagnostic Code 5262 addresses impairment of the tibia and fibula from malunion or nonunion.  Diagnostic Code 5263 addresses genu recurvatum.

The Board must consider the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability under each diagnostic code and apply the appropriate ratings without having any of the symptomatology be duplicative or overlapping.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).  The Veteran cannot receive compensation under two different codes for the same manifestations of symptoms as this would constitute impermissible pyramiding under 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  For example, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 allows for a single 10 percent rating for painful motion of a joint when no compensable rating is warranted, not for painful motion under each of the limitation-of-motion diagnostic codes pertaining to a joint.  Moreover, if painful motion is compensated under one diagnostic code, in order to support entitlement to a separate rating under an additional diagnostic code, ratings must represent a compensable degree of disability independent of the pain that is already being compensated.

The Veteran was rated at 10 percent respectively under Diagnostic Code 5024-5261 and Diagnostic Code 5024-5259, from November 1, 2006.  A noncompensable rating was also assigned under 5024-5260 based on right knee limitation of flexion, from November 15, 2023.

Under the applicable rating criteria, in order to warrant an increased rating for the right knee disability, the evidence must show:

Limitation of flexion of the leg to 45 degrees (10 percent under Diagnostic Code 5260);

Limitation of extension of the leg to 15 degrees (20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5261);

A 10 percent rating is the maximum rating available under Diagnostic Code 5259 for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage.

38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds increased ratings are not warranted.

Specifically, an October 2023 treatment record from Ft Belvoir Community Hospital shows that the Veteran was seen for tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the right knee for CSI injection and reported right knee joint pain rated as 2 on a scale of 1 to 10.  There was no right knee effusion.

A VA examination was obtained in October 2023 to determine the level of disability for the right knee.  The diagnosis was right knee patellar tendinosis status post meniscal tear and partial lateral meniscectomy and debridement of the lateral femoral condyle.  The Veteran reported constant right knee that he currently rated as 5 to 6 with sitting and up to 7 with walking.  He used Voltaren gel.  He did report any flare-ups.  Range of motion (ROM) of the right knee consisted of flexion to 50 degrees and extension 0 degrees with pain on examination.  There was evidence of pain with weight bearing, nonweight bearing, active motion, and on rest, that did not result in functional loss.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus.  There was evidence of right knee tenderness with palpation, moderate in severity.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of ROM after three repetitions.  The Veteran denied flare-ups.  The examination was not conducted after repetitive use over time; however, the examiner estimated that the right knee ROM after repetitive use over time would consist of flexion to 50 degrees and extension to 0 degrees, due to pain.  The Veteran had bony hypertrophy in the medial knee contributing to the disability.  There was no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis of the knee.  The examiner stated that the Veteran was not able to perform joint stability testing because he was unable to flex the knee past 50 degrees due to increased pain.  However, there was no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, or recurrent patellar instability.  There was no evidence or history of tibial and or fibular impairment.  The Veteran had meniscus tear, frequent episodes of joint pain, and frequent episodes of joint effusion.  As to the disability's impact on the Veteran's ability to work, the examiner noted the Veteran had pain with standing, walking, and sitting.  The Veteran reported he lost 0 to 1 work time in the last 12 months due to right knee disability.  The examiner stated that passive ROM testing was not performed because it was not medically advisable as it may cause the Veteran severe pain or the risk of further injury.  

There is no evidence the Veteran's right knee flexion has been limited to 45 degrees or less or right knee extension limited to 15 degrees or more at any time.  Thus, the evidence does not demonstrate an increased rating based on limitation of motion is warranted.

Regarding instability, the Board notes that treatment records do not show, and the Veteran did not report, instability.  The December 2023 VA examiner indicated that there was no history of recurrent subluxation, recurrent patellar dislocation, or lateral instability of the right knee.

The Board also considered whether a higher rating is warranted for his right knee disability based on functional loss due to fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, pain on weight-bearing, flareups, and weakness.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see Sharp, 29 Vet. App. 26; Correia, 28 Vet. App. 158; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 206.

When considering the evidence, although he experiences the aforementioned symptoms, overall, it does not appear that these symptoms result in additional and significant functional loss, and his complaints are adequately contemplated in the ratings he currently receives.  See Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 37-43 (2011) (pain must affect some aspect of the normal working movements of the body such as strength, speed, coordination, or endurance).  Notably, at the examination in December 2023 estimated the range of motion due to pain to be limited to 50 degrees for flexion, which is contemplated in his current rating.  Additionally, the Veteran denied flare-ups.  Overall, the evidence does not demonstrate significant functional loss greater than his current ratings.

Furthermore, the evidence of record does not support separate ratings for the Veteran's right knee disability under Diagnostic Code 5256, Diagnostic Code 5257, Diagnostic Code 5258, or Diagnostic Code 5263, as there is no evidence of ankylosis, subluxation or lateral instability, frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint, or genu recurvatum.

Accordingly, the persuasive weight of the evidence indicates an increased rating for right knee patellar tendinosis status post meniscal tear and partial lateral meniscectomy and debridement lateral femoral condyle is not warranted, and the claims must be denied.

As the Board finds the evidence to be persuasively against the claims for an increased rating for the right knee disability, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
