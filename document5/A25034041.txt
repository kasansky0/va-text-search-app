FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran was noted as having left ear hearing loss on his enlistment examination.

2.  The Veteran's preexisting left ear hearing loss did not increase in severity beyond its natural progression during his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Left ear hearing loss was not aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1986 to May 1996.

A rating decision was issued under the legacy system in April 2018, and the Veteran submitted a timely notice of disagreement.  In March 2020, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a statement of the case (SOC).  The Veteran opted the appeal into the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), by submitting a VA Form 10182 in March 2020 and identifying the March 2020 SOC.  Therefore, the March 2020 SOC is the decision on appeal.

In the March 2020 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2020 SOC, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the March 2020 SOC and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted and the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims for service connection for eczema, right ear hearing loss, and a low back disorder and for an increased evaluation for the right shoulder disability, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in January 2024.  A transcript of that proceeding is of record.

Law and Analysis

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issue decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  If there is no showing of a resulting chronic condition during service, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required to support a finding of chronicity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  As sensorineural hearing loss is a chronic disease for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including sensorineural hearing loss, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

A veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).  A history of preservice existence of conditions recorded at the time of examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions but will be considered together with all other material evidence in determinations as to inception. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b)(1); see also Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994).

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153.

The law provides that an increase in disability must consist of worsening of the enduring disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 402 (1995). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups of symptoms of a preexisting condition, alone, do not constitute sufficient evidence for a non-combat veteran to show increased disability for the purposes of determinations of service connection based on aggravation under section 1153 unless the underlying condition worsened. Davis v. Principi, 276 F. 3d 1341, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991).

For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for left ear hearing loss.

Initially, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness does not apply in this case because the Veteran was found to have left ear hearing loss at the time of his February 1986 enlistment examination.  In particular, an audiogram revealed a puretone threshold of 55 decibels at 4000 Hertz, and he was assigned a hearing profile of H2. See Odiorne v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 456, 457 (1992) (PULHES profile reflects the overall physical and psychiatric condition of a veteran on a scale of 1 (high level of fitness) to 4 (a medical condition or physical defect which is below the level of medical fitness for retention in the military service)); 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15 (2016).  He was also granted a waiver for high frequency hearing loss in June 1985.  Thus, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's preexisting left ear hearing loss was aggravated by his military service beyond its natural progression.

At the time of the Veteran's February 1986 enlistment examination audiogram, his puretone thresholds, in decibels, were documented as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	5 	5	5	15	55

During a February 1988 audiogram, the Veteran was documented as having pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	0	0	0	15	0

A July 1988 audiogram found pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	 0	0	0	15	0

A May 1989 audiogram also revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	0 	0	0	20	50

During another May 1989 audiogram, the Veteran had pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	0	0	0	20	60

A May 1990 audiogram documented pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	10 	0	5	15	45

During an April 1992 audiogram, the Veteran had pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	0 	5	10	25	65

During a December 1994 audiogram, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	 0	0	5	25	60

A January 1995 audiogram showed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	0	0	0	15	60

During an additional January 1995 audiogram, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	5	10	5	20	25

A February 1995 audiogram revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	5	0	5	25	50

During a May 1995 examination, the Veteran was documented as having pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

LEFT	 5	0	5	25	50

Although the in-service audiograms do show some variance, they do not demonstrate any increase in the severity of the Veteran's left ear hearing loss beyond its natural progression.  In fact, a comparison of the first and last audiological examinations show a 5 decibel decrease at 1000 Hertz and 4000 Hertz and only a 10 decibel increase at 3000 Hertz with no change in the pure tone threshold at 500 and 2000 Hertz.  

Moreover, a March 2018 VA examiner reviewed the evidence and opined that the Veteran's preexisting left ear hearing loss was not aggravated by beyond its normal progression in service.  He noted that the February 1986 and May 1995 examinations showed hearing loss at 4000 and 6000 Hertz with no significant threshold shift.

The law provides that an increase in disability must consist of worsening of the enduring disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups do not constitute sufficient evidence to show increased disability for service connection based on aggravation under section 1153. Davis v. Principi, 276 F. 3d 1341, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991).

The Board also finds it significant that there is no indication that the Veteran was seen for left ear hearing loss shortly after service or for many years thereafter. Evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors, as evidence of whether a preexisting condition was aggravated by military service. See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

There is no other medical opinion otherwise indicating that the Veteran's preexisting left ear hearing loss was aggravated by his military service beyond its natural progression.

The Board does acknowledge the Veteran's assertions that his current left ear hearing loss is related to his military service.  He is competent to report as to observable symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, competence must be distinguished from probative weight.  To the extent that the Veteran is competent to opine on this matter, the Board finds that the medical opinion of the March 2018 VA examiner is of greater probative weight than the more general lay assertions in this regard.  The examiner has training, knowledge, and expertise on which he relied to form his opinion, and he supported his conclusion with rationale.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the competent and probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim. Accordingly, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted for left ear hearing loss.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Upon review, the Board finds that additional development is needed to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors for the remaining issues on appeal.

Right Shoulder Disability

A February 2018 VA examiner noted that the Veteran had flare-ups of his service-connected right shoulder disability; however, she did not provide estimates as to the degrees of range of motion during flare-ups.  She also indicated that she was unable to state without mere speculation that pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability during flare-ups because there is no conceptual or empirical basis for such a determination without directly observing function under those conditions.  However, in Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 33 (2017), the Court noted that the adequacy of a VA examination not conducted during a flare-up depends on whether the examiner was sufficiently informed of and conveyed any additional or increased symptoms and limitations experienced during a flare-up.  In addition, the February 2018 examiner did not provide the range of motion findings for passive motion and non-weight bearing as required under Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

The Veteran was provided another VA shoulder examination in January 2020 during which he denied having flare-ups, but the examiner still did not provide all of findings required under Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).

For these reasons, the Board finds that an additional examination was needed to ascertain the severity and manifestations of the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability. 

Back Disorder

A September 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis of the spine, but she opined that the back disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  She acknowledged that the Veteran was treated for a back condition during service, but she found that the condition was acute without chronicity of care and/or treatment after the injury. In this regard, the examiner noted that he had been separated from service for over 20 years and that there are no supporting treatment records showing continuity of the issues or that the symptoms emerged within 12 months of discharge.

A February 2018 VA examiner also diagnosed the Veteran with degenerative arthritis of the spine and initially provided a positive nexus opinion.  However, another VA examiner provided an addendum report in which he noted that there was an error in the previous opinion.  He instead concluded that the Veteran's current back disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner found that there was no documentation of a degenerative lumbar spine condition during service.  He explained that, although the Veteran had some acute low back pain, he was predominantly seen for pain between the shoulder blades beginning in January 1995 after he had surgery on his shoulder.  The Veteran had physical therapy for a muscle strain of the thoracic spine (rhomboid muscles) in May 1995.  He also noted that there were no radiology studies of the lumbar spine prior to 2017.  The examiner found that that there was a 20-year gap between the Veteran's separation from service and 2017 when he was documented as having a lumbar degenerative arthritis condition and not thoracic back pain.  Thus, he concluded that there is no established medical nexus relating the current back disorder to service.

Nevertheless, the Board notes that the examiners did not explain the significance of any evidentiary gap between the Veteran's military service and subsequent treatment for a back disorder.  They also did not address whether any injury in service could have led to the later development of arthritis.  Nor did they discuss how the current disorder generally presents or develops.  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional medical opinion was needed.

Eczema

A February 2018 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of eczema to the torso that flares up at times, but she opined that the disorder was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner found that he had no issues related to a rash prior to military service and that there is no evidence of current, chronic, or continuous treatment and care.  However, her rationale did not explain the significance of those findings.  Nor did the examiner address the Veteran's lay statements that his rash has been intermittent since service and lasts for a couple of hours such that it has gone away by the time he has a medical appointment.  Therefore, the Board finds that another VA medical examination and opinion was needed to determine the etiology of the Veteran's eczema disorder.

Right Ear Hearing Loss

A February 2017 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with right ear hearing loss, but she did not provide an opinion regarding the etiology of the disorder. 

A March 2018 VA examiner later opined that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by or a result of an event in military service. She noted that the Veteran's enlistment and separation examinations both showed normal hearing.  However, the examiner did not explain the significance of those findings or discuss how hearing loss generally presents or develops following noise exposure.  In addition, she did not address whether the Veteran's delayed-onset hearing loss could be related to his military service, including noise exposure therein, regardless of the fact that the disorder did not have its onset therein. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional medical opinion was needed to determine the etiology of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to ascertain the severity and manifestations of his service-connected right shoulder disability.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should report all signs and symptoms necessary for rating the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder disability under the rating criteria.  In particular, the examiner should provide the range of motion in degrees for both shoulders in active motion, passive motion, weight-bearing, and nonweight-bearing. If the examiner is unable to conduct the required testing or concludes that the required testing is not necessary in this case, he or she should clearly explain so in the report.

The presence of objective evidence of pain, excess fatigability, incoordination, and weakness should also be noted, as should any additional disability, including additional limitation of motion, due to these factors.

The examiner should also discuss any additional functional impairment that occurs during flare-ups, including any additional limitation of motion. To the extent possible, he or she should address the frequency, duration, characteristics, and severity of flareups (through the examination findings, review of the medical records, and/or history provided by the Veteran). The examiner is specifically requested to estimate as to degrees of range of motion lost during flare-ups and/or with repeated use. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion as to functional loss, he or she should provide an explanation in the report.

In addition, the examiner should state whether there is any form of ankylosis; malunion, recurrent dislocation, fibrous union, nonunion (false flail joint), or loss of head (flail shoulder) of the humerus; or any impairment of the clavicle or scapula.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

2.  The Veteran should be afforded another VA examination to determine the etiology of his low back disorder.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that any current back disorder is causally or etiologically related to the Veteran's military service, to include any injury or symptomatology therein. 

The examiner should discuss how any current low back disorder generally presents or develops.  If the examiner finds any gap in time between the Veteran's military service and the onset of the disorder to be probative, he or she should provide an explanation of its medical significance.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

3.   The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the etiology of his eczema.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that any current eczema is causally or etiologically related to the Veteran's military service, including any symptomatology therein.  He or she should address the Veteran's lay statements that he has had an intermittent rash since service that goes away before is able to get a medical appointment.

The examiner should discuss how eczema generally presents or develops.  If the examiner finds any gap in time between the Veteran's military service and the onset of the disorder to be probative, he or she should provide an explanation of its medical significance.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

4.  The AOJ should obtain a medical opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file.

It should be noted that the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should state this with a fully reasoned explanation.

It should also be noted that the absence of evidence of a hearing loss disability during service is not always fatal to a service connection claim.  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability and a medically sound basis for attributing that disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting the regulatory requirements for a hearing loss disability for VA purposes, and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has right ear hearing loss that manifested in or is otherwise causally or etiologically related to his military service, including noise exposure therein.

In rendering the opinion, the examiner should discuss medically known or theoretical causes of hearing loss and describe how hearing loss which results from noise exposure, or an injury generally presents or develops in most cases, as distinguished from how hearing loss develops from other causes, in determining the likelihood that current hearing loss was caused by noise exposure or injury in service as opposed to some other causes.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
