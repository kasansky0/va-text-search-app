ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as secondary to service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus, is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's GERD is caused by his service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus.

2. The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is caused by his service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for GERD as secondary to general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

2. The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1998 to July 1999. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in October 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Notably, the October 2022 rating decision was a higher-level review of a rating decision issued in July 2022. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for GERD, as secondary to service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus.

2. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, as secondary to service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus.

The Veteran contends his GERD and obstructive sleep apnea are caused by or aggravated by his service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus. 

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 (1995).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the July 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found the Veteran had diagnoses of GERD and obstructive sleep apnea and the Veteran has been service-connected for general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder. The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings under the AMA. There is no clear and unmistakable evidence to rebut these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c). Therefore, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's GERD and obstructive sleep apnea are proximately due to or aggravated by the Veteran's general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder.

The Veteran was provided a VA opinion in April 2022 to address the etiology of his claimed GERD and obstructive sleep apnea. The VA examiner opined the Veteran's claimed conditions were less likely than not related to the Veteran's general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder. However, the VA examiner indicated general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder, "can aggravate the [GERD], however, does not cause it. Yet there is no scientific evidence that positively links anxiety to increased stomach acid." The VA examiner did not directly provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder at least as likely as not aggravates the Veteran's GERD or obstructive sleep apnea. Further, the VA examiner did not opine whether the Veteran's GERD and obstructive sleep apnea are caused by the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities, alone or in combination with the Veteran's general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder.

The Veteran also provided the private medical opinions of Drs. B.V. and S.L. in March 2022. Dr. B.V. opined the Veteran's GERD and obstructive sleep apnea were at least as likely as not caused by the Veteran's general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus. Dr. S.L. also opined the Veteran's GERD was "[M]ore likely than not caused by, or contributed to by his Tinnitus and Generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder." While the record does not indicate Drs. B.V. and S.L. reviewed the Veteran's service records, the opinions were based upon the Veteran's medical history and the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and symptomology associated with his conditions. Further, Drs. B.V. and S.L. provided studies which supported their opinions. 

Here, the Board affords great probative value to the aforementioned private clinicians' opinions as such were based on the evidence of record and the Veteran's reported history of his symptomatology and includes supporting studies in support of such opinions. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions"). Further, the April 2022 VA examiner did not address the question of aggravation. A secondary opinion which addresses a causal relationship, but which does not address the question of aggravation, is inadequate. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current GERD and obstructive sleep apnea are caused by or aggravated by his service-connected general anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder and tinnitus. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for GERD and obstructive sleep apnea is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal is granted.
