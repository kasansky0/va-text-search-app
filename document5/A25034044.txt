DOCKET NO. 240730-460779
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 12, 2014, for the award of a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The matter of entitlement to a TDIU prior to September 12, 2014, is currently pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in an appeal in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) legacy appeal system.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this redundant appeal of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(c), 7104(a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3,2500(b), 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1967 to December 1970.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a July 2024 Rating Decision issued by a VA regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability.

For the reasons set forth below, the instant appeal, arising from the Veteran's July 2024 Notice of Disagreement challenging an earlier July 2024 Rating Decision denying entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of individual unemployability, is a redundant appeal subject to dismissal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7104(a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.202.

In sum, the Veteran argues an earlier effective date for his individual unemployability should be considered as he believes a pending individual unemployability claim exists from his July 1997 Form 9 Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. See March 2024 Supplemental Claim Application; July 2024 Notice of Disagreement. July 2024 Third Party Correspondence. 

Since the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, a legacy appeal, Docket Number 97-24-643, has been placed on the docket to address the issue of individual unemployability, stemming from a July 1997 Appeal to the Board. See April 2025 BVA Docketing Letter. 

A rating decision is subject to one review on appeal by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a). As a result, this appeal is redundant to the appeal in Docket Number 97-24-643 and must be dismissed as violating the "one review on appeal" statutory principle. Moreover, the Veteran has not opted that appeal into VA's modernized appeal system. There can be only one valid notice of disagreement as to an issue. Hamilton v. Brown, 39 F.3d 1574, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Because the 1997 appeal has a pending notice of disagreement and the Veteran has neither withdrawn nor opted that appeal into the modernized appeal system, the Board cannot proceed in this appeal.  

This dismissal is not prejudicial to the Veteran because the Board will address the issue of an earlier effective date for individual unemployability in the upcoming decision associated with Docket Number 97 24-643. 38 U.S.C. § 7104.
