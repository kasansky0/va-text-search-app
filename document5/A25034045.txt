ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for unspecified bipolar and related disorder (previously claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's unspecified bipolar and related disorder is due to active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for unspecified bipolar and related disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1998 to July 2000.

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from an October 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which was subsequently subject to higher level review.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for unspecified bipolar and related disorder is granted.

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD due to military sexual trauma. 

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Initially, the AOJ made a favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset in service; the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with disturbance of mood and conduct while in active service. The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

The Veteran's entrance examination and report of medical history are silent for psychiatric complaints. While in active service, the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with disturbance of mood and conduct in June 2000. Shortly thereafter, the Veteran was discharged due to her psychiatric symptoms.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2023. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified bipolar and related disorder explaining that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-V criteria for PTSD because the full diagnostic criteria was not met. The examiner determined that the Veteran's unspecified bipolar and related disorder was at least as likely as not incurred during her military service as evidenced by the mental health treatment and diagnosis of adjustment disorder while in the military. The examiner further explained that the Veteran was treated for mental health issues in service, and that those symptoms are consistent with the Veteran's current mental health symptoms. The Board finds the opinion to be adequate and assigns it probative value as it contains an accurate medical history, provides explanations that contain a sufficient rationale, and was written by a licensed clinical psychologist. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). 

In making this decision, the Board has considered the negative evidence of record and resolved all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the persuasive evidence of record shows that the Veteran's unspecified bipolar and related disorder are due to active service. Accordingly, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection for unspecified bipolar and related disorder are met.
