FINDING OF FACT

On January 27, 2025, prior to promulgation of a decision, the Veteran, in part, withdrew the instant appeal of the July 2024 rating decision, initiated by his September 2024 VA Form 10182, which listed issues as to abdominal aortic aneurysm, aquagenic pruritus, gastroparesis and stomach ulcer, pleuritis, asthma/pulmonary fibrosis, bilateral ear infections, diabetes, hair loss, obliterative bronchiolitis, sarcoidosis, bladder condition, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic rhinitis, coronary artery disease, hypertension, ingrown toenails, peripheral neuropathy, and sleep apnea/insomnia.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal stemming from the September 9, 2024 VA Form 10182 as to the July 2024 rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1984 to July 1987.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In September 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing that rating decision to the Board. He elected the Direct review option.

On January 27, 2025, the Veteran submitted a statement that he "request[s] to withdraw all outstanding claims submitted, with Exception of My HYPERTENSION CLAIM." Two days later, on January 29, 2025, he submitted a statement that he "request[s] that all claims that I made an error and mistake to withdraw on 1/09/25 continue to be worked, processed including All Claims presently being worked on" and "[a]gain, please reinstate all claims that I previously requested to be withdrawn on 1/09/25, It was in error as the VA Make Often." See January 2025 Statements in Support of Claim. The Board notes that, while both statements contain January 9, 2025 in the "DATE SIGNED" box, the first statement was submitted by the Veteran two days prior to the second statement. 

On March 24, 2025, the Veteran then submitted a statement that he "wish[es] to request for a third time to withdraw the following VA Appeals, Higher Reviews and or Direct Reviews" and listed several dates in January 2024, April 2024, July 2024, December 2024, and January 2025. See March 2025 Statement in Support of Claim. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision, and an appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b). Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a). Here, the Veteran followed the procedure outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 and properly withdrew all of his then-outstanding claims, including the instant appeal, upon submission of his January 27, 2025 Statement in Support of Claim. While the Veteran later expressed a desire to "reinstate all claims," § 20.205 does not provide for the ability to rescind a withdrawal. Rather, his withdrawal was effective when received, and the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal.  It is dismissed.

Withdrawal does not preclude filing a new Notice of Disagreement, a request for higher-level review, or a supplemental claim, as to any issue withdrawn, provided such filing would be timely under these rules if the withdrawn appeal had never been filed. Therefore, the Veteran is advised he has until July 14, 2025, to take any of these actions with respect to any of the claims denied in the July 2024 rating decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran has several separate appeals awaiting distribution to a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). As to the appeals that are encompassed by his January 27, 2025 and/or March 25, 2025 withdrawal statements, those appeals will be dismissed in the ordinary course of business following distribution. To the extent any appeals are not encompassed by either withdrawal statement, those appeal will be decided in the ordinary course of business following distribution.
