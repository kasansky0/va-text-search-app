ORDER

Prior to June 30, 2022, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps Reserve from approximately July 1986 to July 1994.

A March 2017 rating decision granted service connection for left and right knee osteoarthritis, left and right knee scars, and tinnitus, presumably based on injuries and exposure to acoustic trauma incurred during the Veteran's periods of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) and inactive duty for training (INACDUTRA) service from July 1986 to February 1987.  See March 2017 Rating Decision - Narrative; February 2023 Deferred Rating (e.g., VA Form 21-6789).  Consequently, he has achieved veteran status.  The Veteran also had periods of ACDUTRA and INACDUTRA in June 1988, from July 1988 to August 1988, and in July 1989, July 1990, and February 1991.  See January 2025 Military Personnel Record.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 higher-level review rating decision adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Within the framework of the AMA, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge in July 2024.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence on record at the time of the June 2023 decision, which was subject to the November 2023 request for higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(d), 20.301.

Prior to June 30, 2022, entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

The Board finds that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to obtain private medical records identified by the Veteran prior to the June 2023 rating decision.  In this regard, an April 2022 primary care secure messaging note shows that the Veteran contacted VA to request a referral to a chiropractor for pain related to his service-connected lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities.  The Board further notes that subsequent VA treatment records show that the Veteran received treatment from a chiropractic therapist through VA Community Care in May 2022, and a June 2022 addendum shows that the vendor was requesting additional visits.  See October 2022 CAPRI; February 2023 CAPRI; June 2023 CAPRI.  

The abovementioned VA treatment records indicate that scanned documents are attached thereto and are available in "VistA - Imaging[.]"  However, the Board notes that the documents scanned into VistA Imaging have not been associated with the claims file.  Thus, the Board finds that a remand is required to obtain these records to cure a duty to assist error with regard to obtaining private medical records.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Associate with the claims file the chiropractic records pertaining to the Veteran's lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities for treatment that was received through VA Community Care dated in or around May 2022.  All scanned documents appear to be available in VistA Imaging.
