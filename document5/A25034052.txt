CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date for the assignment of a 50 percent rating for sleep apnea prior to October 13, 2022 are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than October 13, 2022, for the grant of SMC based on loss of use of creative organ are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2011 to October 2012.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 24, 2023 rating decision issued by Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review option. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of January 24, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after January 24, 2023, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Veteran, in March 2024, submitted a VA 21-22 for the above listed veterans service organization (VSO). In March 2025, the Board sent this VSO a letter recognizing them as the Veteran's representative and informing them that them may submit argument in support of any pending appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 20.5.  The Board held the case for a response, but one has not been received. In light of the March 2025 letter, the Board finds that due process has been met and will proceed to adjudicate this appeal. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and an award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date the claim arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.

Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if the formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claim for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the formal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

For claims for an increase in a service-connected disability, if an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2022 for a 50 percent rating for sleep apnea

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an earlier effective date for the assignment of a 50 percent rating for his service-connected sleep apnea.

Procedurally, the RO granted service connection for sleep apnea in a September 21, 2022 rating decision and awarded a 30 percent rating with an effective of June 6, 2022. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for increased rating for sleep apnea on October 13, 2022 asserting that the sleep apnea had worsened.

After conducting additional development, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim and assigned a higher 50 percent rating with an effective date of October 13, 2022, the date the Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating for sleep apnea. 

The Board notes that the earliest effective date available to the Veteran is June 6, 2022 as this is the effective date for service connection for sleep apnea and within one year prior to receipt of his October 13, 2022 claim for increase, if a factually ascertainable increase is shown within that 4-month period. In this regard, the effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The question before the Board is whether it was factually ascertainable the Veteran's sleep apnea had worsened within one year prior to his claim filed on October 13, 2022.

A review of the evidence of record shows that the use of a breathing assistance device such as a continuous positive airway pressure machine (CPAP) for treatment for his sleep apnea was not required in an August 2022 VA examination report. The Veteran was assessed as requiring the use of medication to treat his sleep apnea.

An October 2022 VA treatment note shows that the Veteran was waiting for an appointment to assess whether he needed a CPAP for treatment for his sleep apnea. 

Shortly thereafter, the Veteran was first assessed as requiring the need for the use of a breathing assistance device such as a CPAP machine on the October 2022 VA examination report. 

The Veteran's sleep apnea is evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847. These criteria provide a noncompensable rating for asymptomatic sleep apnea with documented sleep disorder breathing. A 30 percent rating is provided for persistent daytime hypersomnolence. A 50 percent rating is provided where the use of a breathing assistance device, such as a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine is required. A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or; requires tracheostomy.

The evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that there was a factually ascertainable increase in the severity of the Veteran's sleep apnea prior to October 13, 2022. During the relevant period, as noted above, there is no indication prior to October 13, 2022 showing that the Veteran was prescribed the use of a breathing assistance device which is required for a 50 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6847.  

Since the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that there was a factually ascertainable increase that occurred within one year prior to the date the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for sleep apnea was received, an earlier effective date is not warranted on that basis.

In summary, the evidence reflects that the correct date of the award of the 50 percent rating is October 13, 2022 as the use of a breathing assistance device was not factually ascertainable prior to this date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 13, 2022 for special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ

The January 2023 rating decision granted SMC based on loss of use of creative organ, effective October 13, 2022. The Veteran is appealing for an earlier effective date. 

In this case, the grant of SMC based on loss of use of creative organ is an ancillary benefit that is attached to the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction. In other words, the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction provides the basis for the grant of service connection. Accordingly, the effective date for the grant of SMC and the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction are the same. For this reason, to properly address the issue of an earlier effective date for the grant of SMC, the Board needs to address whether the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction.

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service. Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Effective March 24, 2015, claims are required to be filed on standard forms, thus eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). Prior to March 24, 2015, a "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). A claim for VA compensation must generally be in the form prescribed by the VA Secretary. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). Any communication or action, however, received from the claimant, or certain specified individuals on the claimant's behalf, that indicates intent to apply for a benefit, and identifies that benefit, may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

The record shows that the Veteran raised the issue of service connection for erectile dysfunction in a claim that VA received on October 13, 2022. There is no argument or indication in the record that VA received either a formal or informal claim of service connection for erectile dysfunction prior to October 12, 2022. In the absence of evidence showing that VA received a claim of service connection for erectile dysfunction prior to October 13, 2022, the Board finds that an earlier effective for the grant of SMC based on loss of creative organ is not warranted.
