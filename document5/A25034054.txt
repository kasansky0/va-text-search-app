DOCKET NO. 230929-382722
DATE: April 11, 2025

ORDER

1. Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for asthma is granted.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's asthma resulted in his taking daily inhalation or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalation anti-inflammatory medication; however, there is no evidence of FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.  

2. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is not characterized by the presence of polyps or in greater than 50 percent obstruction of the bilateral nasal passages or complete obstruction of one nasal passage.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an increased disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, DC 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 2005 to January 2011, including service in Southwest Asia.

The case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), requesting Direct Review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Under this appeal lane, the Board may only consider evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the September 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of sinusitis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

Increased Ratings

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries. The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

A claimant may also experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

1. An increased rating in excess of 10 percent disabling for asthma.

Specific Legal Criteria

Under DC 6602, a 10 percent rating for is warranted for FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy. A 30 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, FEV- 1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, daily inhalation or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalation anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent rating is provided where there is FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. A 100 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of less than 40 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of less than 40 percent, more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or the requirement of daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his asthma symptomatology warrants a higher rating.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

Under DC 6602, a 10 percent rating for is warranted for FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy. A 30 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of 56 to 70 percent predicted, FEV- 1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, daily inhalation or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalation anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent rating is provided where there is FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. A 100 percent rating is warranted for FEV-1 of less than 40 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of less than 40 percent, more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or the requirement of daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the Veteran is entitled to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for the period on appeal. 

Throughout the month of June 2022, the Veteran's medical records include an active medications list noting he takes Albuterol, 2 puffs per day by mouth every 4 hours. Albuterol remains listed on the active medication list in September 2022 and through at least May 2023. Additionally, on a May 2023 primary care note, it describes that for allergic rhinitis/shortness of breath, the Veteran has an inhaler, "which he uses prn/infrequently; currently taking Claritin, although sometimes alternates with Allegra; start Montelukast 10 mg daily."

The Board notes that although the Veteran is entitled to a 30 percent rating, there is no evidence of record during the appeal period demonstrating an FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.

In sum, the Board finds that throughout the entire period on appeal, from June 6, 2022, through September 1, 2023 (including the one-year lookback period), an increased disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's asthma.

2. An initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis.

Specific Legal Criteria

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is rated under DC 6522. Under DC 6522, a 10 percent disability rating is awarded for rhinitis without nasal polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The maximum 30 percent disability rating is awarded for rhinitis with polyps.

Analysis

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis. He currently has a non-compensable (0 percent) rating for this service-connected condition.

Medical evidence of record includes a March 2022 pulmonary examination consultation. It indicated that the Veteran has a respiratory condition for which the Veteran requires inhalational bronchodilator therapy. Additionally, records from April 2022 indicate there is "very mild airflow obstruction; no significant response to the bronchodilator."

The Veteran was also afforded an April 2023 VA examination addressing sinusitis, rhinitis, and other conditions of the nose, throat, larynx, and pharynx. During the examination, the Veteran described his sinusitis symptoms starting as a scratch at the back of his throat, and then days later having a yellow-ish discharge and a sore throat. He also described having nasal congestion, noting that when this happens, he goes to his primary care physician for medication. However, the VA examiner found no polyps and no obstructions to the nasal passages.

The Board has carefully reviewed the entire record. In reaching its decision, the Board has considered the benefit of the doubt rule but has determined that it is not applicable because the evidence is persuasively against the claim of an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis. Neither the medical records nor the VA examinations reflect there being greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. Accordingly, the appeal must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc)

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for sinusitis.

The veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2023. During the examination, the Veteran described his sinusitis symptoms starting as a scratch at the back of his throat, and then days later having a yellow-ish discharge and a sore throat. He also described having nasal congestion, noting that when this happens, he goes to his primary care physician for medication. He also stated that he was given a Z-pak, which he picks up from a pharmacy.  Further, he noted symptoms of sinusitis started around 2009.  Despite the Veteran's lay statements and documented reports of sinus issues throughout and post-service and active medications during the examination, the VA examiner simply discounted and failed to consider either without providing a reason why. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). As such, the medical examination provided was inadequate.

Additionally, for the Veteran's service connection claims, remand is required for additional development pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). See 38 U.S.C. § 1168. The PACT Act requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected him or her to participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1).

Evidence indicates the Veteran experienced shortness of breath, upper respiratory infections, and worsening sinus issues during service. The Veteran posits he has sinusitis that began at least in 2009 as a result of his exposure to burn pits in Iraq. Additionally, medical records confirm the Veteran was stationed in both Iraq and Qatar for 8 months each. Thus, there is evidence the Veteran participated in a TERA during service due to having served in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations.

The PACT Act legislation was in effect at the time of the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, and it provides a statutory duty to obtain a TERA opinion as it may aid in substantiating the Veteran's claim. 38 U.S.C. § 1168. Failure to obtain a VA medical opinion for this claim constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Because the requirements to obtain a medical opinion compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 1168 are met, but such opinion has not yet been obtained for this claim, remand is needed for VA to obtain one.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's sinusitis. The entire claims file should be reviewed by the examiner.

2. Thereafter, the examiner must opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's sinusitis is related to an in-service injury or disease, including in-service exposure to toxins in Iraq and Qatar. 

In providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: (a) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (b) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

Consideration should also be given to the Veteran's lay statements regarding continuity of symptomology since service, along with all service treatment records and medical records denoting symptoms related to sinusitis.

A detailed rationale supporting the examiner's opinions should be provided. (By law, the Board is not permitted to rely on any conclusion that is not supported by a thorough explanation. Providing an opinion or conclusion without a thorough explanation will delay processing of the claim and may also result in a clarification being requested).
