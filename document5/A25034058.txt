ISSUE

Whether the Veteran's request for a waiver of an overpayment debt in the amount of $7,272.00 of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pension benefits was timely filed.

REMANDED

The issue of whether the Veteran's request for a waiver of an overpayment debt in the amount of $7,272.00 of VA pension benefits was timely filed is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 2000 to January 2002.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2022 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). 

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. ยง 20.301.

Whether the request for a waiver of an overpayment for VA pension benefits was timely filed

Under applicable criteria, a request for waiver of an indebtedness shall only be considered if made within 180 days following the date of a notice of indebtedness to the debtor. The 180-day period may be extended if the individual requesting waiver demonstrates, as a result of error by either the VA or the postal authorities, or due to other circumstances beyond the debtor's control, there was a delay in such individual's receipt of the notification of indebtedness beyond the time customarily required for mailing. If the debtor does substantiate there was such a delay in the receipt of the notice of indebtedness, the 180-day period shall be computed from the date of the debtor's actual receipt of the notice of indebtedness. 38 U.S.C. ยง 5302 (a); 38 C.F.R. ยง 1.963 (b)(2).

In September 2014, the Pension Management Center (PMC) sent the Veteran a letter stating that his pension benefits could not be reinstated and that the payments previously made to him were in error.  The letter explained that VA had taken the necessary action and that the Veteran would not incur any debt as a result of this. 

For reasons unknown, in October 2014, the Debt Management Center (DMC) sent the Veteran a first demand letter of his overpayment debt in the amount of $7,272.00.  Under the section "What Are Your Rights?," the letter indicates that the Veteran may request a waiver.  The section directs the Veteran to an enclosed document for more information.  The enclosed document is not of record. 

In a March 2015 letter - dated in February 2015 - the DMC notified the Veteran that it was unable to accept the requested monthly payment of $25.00 towards repayment of the overpayment debt.  The Veteran's original request for $25.00 monthly payments is not of record.  

In a July 2022 decision, the COWC found that the Veteran's July 2022 waiver request was untimely.  

Given the state of the record, a remand is warranted for the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.  In that regard, the Board is unable to determine if the Veteran was properly notified of the timeframe for requesting a waiver as the noted "enclosed document" notifying the Veteran about his options is not of record.  Further, the Board also notes that the July 2022 COWC decision found that the Veteran submitted a waiver request in July 2022.  However, the actual waiver request (and any associated FSR) has not been associated with the Veteran's electronic claims folder. Accordingly, remand under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) for this circumstance remains appropriate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the enclosed document referenced in the July 2022 DMC demand letter (FL 4-474b-3) which explained the Veteran's options for repayment.

Under the section "What Are Your Rights?," the letter indicates that the Veteran may request a waiver.  The section directs the Veteran to an enclosed document for more information.  The enclosed document is not of record.

If unable to obtain, document what steps were taken. 

2. Then, obtain and upload the Veteran's waiver request to the electronic claims folder.
