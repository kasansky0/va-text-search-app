ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for the award of a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for the award of special monthly compensation based on housebound criteria (SMC-HB) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for award of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A January 2023 rating decision awarded service connection for sleep apnea, effective April 16, 2021; the rating assigned remained pending; it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone has prevented him from obtaining and maintaining employment from April 16, 2021.

2. From April 16, 2021, the Veteran has been in receipt of a TDIU due to service-connected PTSD, plus additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable as at least 60 percent disabling.

3. The Veteran became permanently and totally disabled for purposes of DEA benefits on April 16, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for award of a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R.

§§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2), 4.16(a).

2. The criteria for SMC at the housebound rate are met, effective April 16, 2021. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(i).

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for basic eligibility for DEA benefits have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1966 to November 1969.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, wherein he also waived his right to select a different review option. See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (February 2025). See also, Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim or a claim for an increased evaluation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

The effective date of an award of a TDIU is generally determined in accordance with the effective date rules for increased ratings. Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000) (holding that a claim for a TDIU is a claim for an increased rating and the effective date rules for increased ratings apply to a claim for TDIU). However, as applicable here, where a claim for a TDIU stems from an initial grant of service connection and an initial disability rating assignment, the effective date rules for service-connection apply by analogy. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (explaining that Hurd v. West does not support the proposition that a claim for entitlement to a TDIU is always a claim for an increased rating).

Additionally, under the AMA, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph(c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Continuously pursuing a claim occurs where, after notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the Veteran files a supplemental claim, requests a higher-level review, or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or after notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the Veteran files a supplemental claim or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

1. Entitlement to a TDIU rating prior to July 7, 2023.

The August 2024 rating decision on appeal awarded entitlement to TDIU based on the Veteran's service-connected PTSD alone, effective from July 7, 2023, the date of receipt of the Veteran's formal TDIU application, VA Form VA 21-8940. See Rating Decision (August 2024). At that time, the Veteran had a 70 percent schedular rating for PTSD from June 29, 2014. 

This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with effective date assigned for TDIU in the August 2024 rating. See VA Form 10182 (February 2025); NOD (February 2025).

The Board concludes the criteria for an effective date of April 16, 2021, for the award of TDIU on a schedular basis, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R.

§§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2), 4.16(a).

By way of history, on April 16, 2021, VA received an intent to file a claim for compensation. See Intent to File (April 2021). Then on May 6, 2021, VA received a claim, in part, for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) (May 2021). The Veteran continuously pursued his claim for service connection for OSA until it was granted in a January 2023 Board decision and implemented in a January 2023 rating decision, which assigned a 50 percent disability rating, effective April 16, 2021. See BVA Decision (January 2023); Rating Decision - Narrative (January 2023). In July 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, objecting, in part, to the rating assigned. The Veteran submitted, in conjunction with his supplemental claim, a formal claim for TDIU that listed PTSD, OSA, tinnitus, hypertension, and right ear hearing loss as the basis for unemployment. See VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (July 2023). The Veteran's claim for entitlement to TDIU is part and parcel of his claim for an initial higher rating for OSA. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). As a result, the earliest date of claim for effective date purposes is April 16, 2021.

As noted above, the Veteran has been awarded entitlement to TDIU from July 7, 2023. See Rating Decision (August 2024). Thus, only the period prior to July 7, 2023, remains on appeal and must be adjudicated herein. Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356 (2018) (holding that, where the RO grants a TDIU that does not span the entire period on appeal, the TDIU remains on appeal). 

Of relevance, the Board previously raised the claim of TDIU in an April 2014 decision in accordance with Rice as the Veteran contended his PTSD affected his employability in an August 2013 statement and February 2014 hearing. See Correspondence (August 2013); Hearing Transcript (February 2014); BVA Decision (April 2014). In September 2018, however, the Veteran requested withdrawal for the claim of TDIU and a November 2018 Board decision dismissed that matter. See Correspondence (September 2018); BVA Decision (November 2018). Prior to April 16, 2021, there is no formal or informal unadjudicated claim for TDIU, to include any unadjudicated inferred claim for TDIU.

Accordingly, the Board must decide if it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran could not obtain or retain substantially gainful employment because of his service-connected disabilities from April 16, 2021 to July 7, 2023.

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one such disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of service-connected disabilities on the ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

In determining unemployability, there is an economic component and a non-economic component. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 73. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. at 73.

Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. For purposes of this section, marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts-found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). The Court defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. 

§ 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).

The Board finds, resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, that from April 16, 2021, the Veteran was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected PTSD alone and that he met the schedular requirements for schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) during that timeframe. See 38 U.S.C.

 § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

From April 16, 2021, the Veteran was service-connected for PTSD (70%); OSA (50%); tinnitus (10%); GERD (10%); hypertension (10%); and right ear hearing loss (0%). His combined disability rating was 90 percent. Therefore, the Veteran met the numeric requirements for schedular TDIU from April 16, 2021. See Rating Decision - Codesheet (August 2024).

The Veteran reported previous work as a logistics coordinator. He has completed 4 years of high school and a 3-month course for heating and air conditioning training. See VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (July 2023).

The record reflects that the Veteran has been unemployed throughout the applicable period under appeal. The Veteran has consistently reported that he stopped working in May 2012, and he submitted a record of earnings report from the Social Security Administration (SSA) which showed he has not earned income since 2012. See SSA/SSI Letter (July 2023); see also VA 21-8940 (June 2014). Accordingly, the economic component has been met for the entire period on appeal.

The Veteran has consistently reported that his service-connected PTSD prevented him from securing and following substantially gainful employment. The Veteran stated that he retired early as he was unable to cope with the additional stress of a promotion he received. Correspondence (August 2013); see also Hearing Transcript (February 2014) (noting the Veteran had intended to retire at the age of 66 but felt pressured to take a new position as logistics coordinator that was an office position). 

The Veteran's wife reported that the stress of the Veteran's work resulted in a nervous and exhausted demeanor that improved once he retired. See Buddy / Lay Statement (June 2014). Further, his prior supervisor submitted correspondence indicating that the Veteran was unable to perform at the level required due to stressful nature of the job. See Buddy / Lay Statement (June 2014).

A June 2014 VA mental health examination report reflects that the Veteran's PTSD disability resulted in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The report notes symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks occurring weekly or less, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The report determined that while the Veteran's PTSD caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. See C&P Exam (June 2014).

During March 2019 private treatment, the Veteran reported a high level of stress that impacted the quality of his life. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (August 2023). The Veteran reported increased symptoms of depression and anxiety in February 2022. See CAPRI at 49 (November 2023). In January 2023, the Veteran reported that nearly every day he felt down, depressed or hopeless and had little interest or please in doping things. See Id. at 57. He reported a lack of pleasure in activities and sleep difficulties. During March 2023 mental health VA treatment, the Veteran explained that he did not like to go anywhere because he felt safer at home. See Id. at 20. He reported anxiety and stress. 

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted an employability evaluation completed by a private consultant. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (June 2024). The evaluation report cited to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, "a resource developed by the Department of Labor that classified over 12,000 occupations in the United States to classify and identify the physical demands of the job." Id. at 2. The evaluation report reflects that the Veteran's prior occupation most closely aligned with a shipping and receiving supervisor. The consultant determined that the Veteran's service-connected PTSD at least as likely as not precluded him from securing and following gainful employment from at least April 2021. The consultant explained that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms of depression, anxiety, panic attacks, disturbances in motivation and mood, hypervigilance, intrusive thoughts, concentration deficits, irritability and outbursts of anger, suspiciousness, exaggerated startle response, avoidance of crows, feelings of detachment and estrangement from other, and difficulties establishing and maintaining effective relationships, "posed limitations that are inconsistent with the basic demands of skilled and unskilled work across all exertional levels." The consultant emphasized that he did not think that the Veteran would have been able to "interact with others in an appropriate and professional manner, as is expected in all competitive employment, since at least April 2021." The consultant went on to explain that consistent with the medical evidence, the record also reflected that the Veteran retired early "as he could no longer handle the stress of work." The consultant provided detailed analysis of how the Veteran's PTSD symptoms noted during treatment received during the period on appeal would negatively impact his ability to sustain employment because of his inability to stay on task. The report considered employment where employees engaging with others was not essential to the position, but explained that even in those circumstances, employees are still required to have incidental contact with coworkers. 

Having considered the above evidence, the Board finds TDIU is warranted based on service-connected PTSD alone from April 16, 2021. The probative evidence of record reflects that the Veteran's PTSD significantly interferes with his ability to concentrate and stay on task, to engage with others, and otherwise function in a normal work environment. Given the above, the Board finds that the ability to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment is not realistically within the Veteran's capabilities during the period April 16, 2021 to July 7, 2023.

Based on the foregoing, an effective date of April 16, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of TDIU is warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC-HB.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits.

The Board concludes that, in view of the above grant of an earlier effective date for TDIU, the criteria for an effective date of April 16, 2021, and not earlier, for basic eligibility for DEA benefits and SMC-HB have been met. 38 U.S.C. 

§§ 3501(a)(1), 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

Regarding the earlier effective date for DEA, Chapter 35 benefits, DEA benefits are payable to the child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a Veteran if the following conditions are met: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501(a)(1), 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

SMC-HB is warranted when a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. For the purpose of meeting the first criterion, a rating of 100 percent may be a schedular rating, an extra-schedular rating, or a temporary total rating. Additionally, a TDIU may meet the criterion, but only if assigned for a single disability. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

An August 2024 rating decision granted basic eligibility to DEA benefits and SMC-HB, effective July 7, 2023, the date which the Veteran was adjudicated to be 100 percent disabled. However, as adjudicated above, TDIU is warranted from April 16, 2021. Additionally, from April 16, 2021 the Veteran has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems.

Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to DEA benefits and SMC-HB from April 16, 2021, and not earlier, are met. 

The above matters, to the extent granted, are subject to the laws and regulations governing payment of monetary benefits.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
