ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's OSA had onset in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2013 to April 2014 and from July 2016 to June 2017. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In that decision, the RO denied service connection for sleep apnea.  In September 2024 the RO, on special review, denied service connection for OSA. 

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The Veteran next asserts that his OSA is related to his military service as it had onset 2014 while he was deployed.

The September 2024 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA as noted on a May 2024 examination report; and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded as the Veteran served in Kuwait from March 1, 2014 to March 31, 2014. The Board is bound the Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Additionally, STR's show that in March 2014, the Veteran complained of trouble sleeping. Therefore, the current disability requirement and the in-service incurrence requirement are met. 

The Veteran reported throughout the appeal period, to include on his August 2023 claim form and during a May 2024 VA examination, that he experienced sleep related symptoms in 2014 while in service and since service, such as snoring, gasping for air while sleeping, daytime sleepiness and feeling tired. Additionally, his wife informed him that his breathing stopped at times while he was asleep. The Board finds these reports credible and therefore competent as they have been consistent throughout the appeal period.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence). 

In addition, the above discussed statements indicating sleep-related symptoms, such as snoring, gasping for air while sleeping, difficulty breathing, daytime sleepiness and feeling tired, both in and since separation from service, combined with the diagnosis of sleep apnea, are sufficient to establish that the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in service. Furthermore, as was reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016 (Vet. App. Feb. 11, 2019), sleep apnea is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection for sleep apnea. Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

Moreover, the May 2024 VA opinion that found that the Veteran's sleep apnea was less likely than not caused by TERA in service, or had its onset in or was related to service because there were no reports or symptoms of sleep apnea in service, is inadequate given that it did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding continuous sleep-related symptoms both in and since separation from service, and did not address whether the sleep apnea had onset in service, regardless of cause. Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1336 (VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of veterans' benefits. This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"). Similarly, while the September 2024 VA addendum opinion acknowledged the in-service report of trouble sleeping, the examiner found that sleep apnea was less likely than not caused by TERA because review of the STRs shows no evidence of the diagnosis or treatment for sleep apnea or diagnostic polysomnography while on active duty. Id.

To the extent that the grant of service connection is based primarily on lay evidence, "[i]f the Board concludes that the lay evidence presented by a veteran is credible and ultimately competent, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence should not be an absolute bar to the veteran's ability to prove his claim of entitlement to disability benefits based on that competent lay evidence." Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337.

At this point, the Board could remand the claim of service connection for a VA examination or opinion. However, such a request could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying the claim, which is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").

For the above reasons, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's OSA had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for OSA is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
