REMANDED

Entitlement to a disabling rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with bruxism is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1996 to October 2001.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2023 decision granting service connection for PTSD with an evaluation of 30 percent effective August 1, 2019.  In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 rating decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, in its review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REMAND

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for service-connected PTSD and contends that his disability impacts his life to a greater degree than his current 30 percent rating reflects.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182 & Addendum to VA Form 10182.

For the following reasons, the Board remands?the Veteran's claim to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors under the provisions of?38?C.F.R. §?20.802.?? 

In January 2023, the Veteran was afforded an Initial PTSD VA Examination.  The examiner determined the Veteran's PTSD was characterized by occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by medication.  The examiner further determined that the following symptoms applied to the Veteran's PTSD: depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment.  The examiner specifically noted that there were no other symptoms attributable to the Veteran's PTSD.  See January 2023 Initial PTSD VA Examination.  However, the Veteran attributed the following symptoms to his PTSD: anger, anxiety, confusion, difficulty thinking straight, distractible, flashbacks, guilt, hypervigilance, obsessively checking if things are safe, low motivation, memory problems, mood swings, panic attacks weekly or less often, poor concentration, sexual dysfunction, poor attention span, emotionless, sudden yelling, lashing out with anger, and staying away from people and large crowds.  See August 2022 Medical Symptoms.  Here, the examiner did not evidence consideration of the symptoms the Veteran attributed to his PTSD. If the examiner did consider the symptoms, the examiner did not make that fact clear and did not explain why the symptoms were not attributed to the Veteran's PTSD.

Based on the foregoing facts of this case, prior to denying the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected PTSD, the AOJ should have obtained an adequate medical exam.  On remand, an adequate medical exam should be obtained to correct the AOJ's pre-decisional duty to assist error.?? 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current severity of his service-connected PTSD. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria. The examiner must attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of symptoms. To the extent possible, the examiner should identify any symptoms and social and occupational impairment due to his service-connected PTSD alone. The entire record must be made available to and be reviewed by the medical professional.
