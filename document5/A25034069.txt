REMANDED

Service connection for a neck condition.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2014 to September 2021.  

This matter is on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.

In a May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service connection for a neck condition. 

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  VA has a duty to provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion on an issue of service connection when the record, (1) contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, (2) indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of a disability may be associated with active service, and (3) the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81 (2006).  The threshold for determining whether the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between a current disability and an in-service event is low.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83. 

Initially, in the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ established the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and favorably found that the Veteran received VA medical treatment for his neck from September 2022 to October 2023.  The Board is bound by these?prior favorable findings, which were not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran contends that he has a neck condition related to active duty.  Specifically, the Veteran contends working as a mechanic and completing other militaristic tasks such as lifting heavy objects contributed to his neck condition and a pinched nerve. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his claimed neck condition.  Rather, in the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ determined that a VA examination and medical opinion was not warranted because the Veteran's records do not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for a neck condition.  For the same reasons, the AOJ determined that service connection was also not warranted. 

However, as stated above, VA is obliged to provide examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim when the record indicates that the disability may be associated with active service.  38 U.S.C.§ 5103A(d); McLendon 20?Vet. App.?at?81.  Here, the Veteran's DD 214 shows his MOS of a Power Generation Equipment Mechanic, for which he was awarded a Driver and Mechanic Badge.  As stated above, the Veteran claims his neck condition is attributed to work related to his MOS.  Furthermore, the Veteran's VA treatment records reveal that he was diagnosed with cervicalgia in April 2023 and cervical spondylosis in August 2023, less than two years after separation from service. 

The foregoing evidence at least suggests that the Veteran has signs or symptoms that may be associated with active-duty service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b).  Thus, the low threshold under McLendon has been met.  

Additionally, in making its determination that service connection was not warranted, the AOJ relied on an absence of documented evidence during and after service without explaining why, as a medical matter, the Veteran would have sought treatment or complained of the condition during or after service, or why an absence of documented treatment or symptoms (as opposed to undocumented symptoms) was otherwise medically significant.  See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30 (2016); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272-75 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 223-24 (2011).  Furthermore, the AOJ failed to consider the Veteran's lay assertions attributing his diagnosed neck condition to his MOS related duties.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 254 (2020); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (finding that an examiner impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions).  

As such, remand is required to remedy the pre-decisional duty to assist errors and to afford the Veteran a VA examination and medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology of his diagnosed neck condition.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed neck condition.  The examiner should review the entire claims file and this remand in conjunction with the examination. 

The examiner should state whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diagnosed neck condition had its onset during service or is etiologically related to service.

The examiner must address in the opinion any relevant lay statements of record.

The examiner should not rely on silence in the medical records unless it can be explained: (a) why the silence in the available records can be taken as proof that the symptoms did not occur, including why the fact would have normally been recorded if present, or (b) why the absence of medical records is medically significant. 

A rationale should be provided for opinions expressed.  If an opinion cannot be offered without resorting to speculation, the reason for this should be fully explained in the opinion.
