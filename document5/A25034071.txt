ORDER

1. The portion of the April 7, 2025 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision that granted an earlier effective date of August 27, 2021 for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is vacated in regard to the effective date of that award only.  This is a partial vacatur of said Board decision.  

2. Entitlement to an effective date of February 17, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a notice of his intent to file (ITF) on February 17, 2021. 

2. The Veteran then filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer on August 27, 2021 which was received within one year of his February 2021 ITF.

3. On April 7, 2025, the Board issued a decision awarding an effective date of August 27, 2021 for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer but overlooked the February 17, 2021 ITF in assigning the effective date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for partial vacatur of the Board's April 7, 2025 decision are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 17, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1967 to October 1970.

This matter initially came before the Board on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Board issued a decision on April 7, 2025, which, in pertinent part, granted an effective date of August 27, 2021 for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer. 

This matter now comes before the Board from its own motion to vacate part of the April 7, 2025 decision. 

1. The portion of the April 7, 2025 Board decision that granted an earlier effective date of August 27, 2021 for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is vacated in regard to the effective date of that award only.  This is a partial vacatur of said Board decision.

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his representative, on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law, or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.  The present motion for partial vacatur comes from the Board's own April 2025 motion.  Id.

In the April 7, 2025 decision, the Board found that the Veteran was entitled to an earlier effective date of August 27, 2021 for the award of service connection for bladder cancer.  Upon review, the Board finds that the April 7, 2025 decision failed to assign the correct earlier effective date for service connection for bladder cancer because the effective date should have been the date of the February 17, 2021 intent to file (ITF).  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

Therefore, the Board concludes that partial vacatur of the April 2025 decision is warranted.  The remainder of the April 2025 Board decision, however, that granted an earlier effective date of September 23, 2021 for diabetes mellitus type II and remanded the inextricably intertwined issue of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate, remains undisturbed.  That said, the AOJ is now asked to determine the Veteran's evaluation for service connection for bladder cancer from February 17, 2021 before readjudicating the inextricably intertwined issue of SMC housebound.

As such, the April 7, 2025 Board decision is PARTIALLY VACATED in regard to the August 27, 2021 effective date for service connection for bladder cancer only.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.  To this extent, the Board's April 2025 motion for partial vacatur is hereby GRANTED.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of February 17, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer is granted.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for bladder cancer.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182. 

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of February 17, 2021, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for bladder cancer.

Procedural Background

The Veteran's military personnel record and DD-214 show that the Veteran had service in Thailand.  See DD-214; see also Military Personnel Record.

The Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents was conceded in a November 2020 Board decision based on his service in Thailand at Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base and at Camp Friendship.  See November 2020 Board Decision.

VA treatment records show that the Veteran's bladder cancer was an "active problem" from December 2020.  See VA Treatment Records.  

The Veteran filed an ITF on February 17, 2021.  See VA Form 21-0966.  Subsequently, within one year of the February 2021 ITF, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for bladder cancer due to Agent Orange (AO) exposure.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer was granted in a February 2023 rating decision pursuant to the PACT Act.  As the claim was granted pursuant to the PACT Act, the effective date for service connection for bladder cancer was August 10, 2022.  See February 2023 Rating Decision.

In February 2024, the Veteran requested HLR of the effective date of service connection for bladder cancer.  See February 2024 VA Form 20-0996.

The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date on the basis that the claims were granted pursuant to the PACT Act, meaning that the AOJ found that August 10, 2022 was the earliest possible effective date.  See February 2024 Rating Decision.

In February 2025, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the February 2024 decision.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182.

Legal Principles

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a "facts found" basis.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before they had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers.  McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

Regarding the date of receipt of a claim, if a veteran submits a formal compensation claim within one year of filing an ITF, VA will consider the claim filed as of the date the ITF was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

In determining whether an earlier effective date for service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, even though there is no record of such disease during service in a veteran who had active military, naval, air, or space service, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, in the Republic of Vietnam (Vietnam), including the waters offshore, and other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e)(c), 3.313.  This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. 

Generally, certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents used in support of military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era will be considered to have been incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6).

On August 10, 2022, the President of the United States signed the PACT Act into law, which extends a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with exposures to certain herbicide agents for veterans who performed active military, naval, air, or space service in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, without regard to where on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the veteran performed.  See PACT Act, Pub. L. No 117-168, § 403(d)(2) (2022); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1116, as amended by Public Law 117-168.  Claims granted under the PACT Act are effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the Act.  An effective date prior to August 10, 2022 may be warranted if the grant is based on another theory of entitlement.

Finally, if, prior to the enactment of the PACT Act, a Veteran had service in Thailand with duties that placed him on or near the perimeters of Thailand military bases, his exposure to herbicide agents could be established on a facts-found basis. 

Analysis

Here, the Veteran's claim for bladder cancer was due to in-service exposure to AO on a direct basis.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Prior to the February 2023 rating decision that granted service connection for bladder cancer pursuant to the PACT Act, herbicide exposure was established on a facts-found basis by the Board in November 2020.  See November 2020 Board Decision.  The Board is bound by that earlier favorable finding of fact.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Further, the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents includes bladder cancer.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), (d), 3.309(e).  In other words, a nexus between the Veteran's bladder cancer and conceded exposure to herbicide agents is presumed.  Id. 

While the PACT Act was a liberalizing law for establishing presumptive herbicide agent exposure for Veterans who served in Thailand, herbicide agent exposure could be established on a facts-found basis for such Veterans before the PACT Act went into effect.  As established, the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents was conceded in November 2020.  His claimed disability, bladder cancer, is an enumerated disease associated with exposure to herbicide agents.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), (d), 3.309(e).  Therefore, the Veteran's bladder cancer should have been service connected irrespective of the change in law under the PACT Act, entitling him to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for bladder cancer. 

As discussed, the effective date is the date of VA receipt of the claim for service connection, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  VA received the Veteran's ITF on February 17, 2021 and claim for bladder cancer on August 27, 2021, within one year of his ITF.  See February 2021 VA Form 21-0966 and August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The record reflects that the Veteran was already diagnosed with bladder cancer before VA received his ITF.  See VA Treatment Records.  The effective date is therefore the date of VA's receipt of the Veteran's ITF, February, 17, 2021, which is later than the date entitlement arose.

Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 17, 2021 for the grant of service connection for bladder cancer is warranted.  The Veteran's claim is hereby GRANTED.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.
