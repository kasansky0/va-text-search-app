REMANDED

From January 6, 2018, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a cervical strain with cervical disc protrusion of C5-C6 and disc excursion of C6-C7 (cervical strain) is remanded.

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome, right knee, is remanded.

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome, left knee, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from June 2010 to January 2018.

Procedural History - Cervical Strain

In January 2018, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) service connected the Veteran's cervical strain.  It rated it as 0 percent disabling effective January 6, 2018.  

On September 22, 2020, the Veteran claimed an increased rating.

In October 2020, the AOJ granted a 10 percent rating effective September 22, 2020.

On November 16, 2020, the Veteran claimed an increased rating.

In December 2020, the AOJ denied the claim.

In October 2021, the Veteran requested a higher-level review (HLR) of the October 2020 rating decision.

In November 2021, the AOJ, in an HLR rating decision, found a duty-to-assist error in the October 2020 rating decision.  Later that month, the Veteran requested an HLR of the December 2020 rating decision.

In December 2021, the AOJ rejected the November 2021 HLR request.

In March 2022, the AOJ, in a supplemental rating decision resulting from the November 2021 HLR rating decision, again denied a rating greater than 10 percent.

In March 2023, the Veteran requested an HLR of the March 2022 rating decision.  

In June 2023, the AOJ, in an HLR rating decision, affirmed the March 2022 rating decision.  It notified the Veteran of the June 2023 HLR rating decision on June 27, 2023.  

Concurrent with the June 2023 HLR rating decision, the AOJ, in a deferred rating decision, believed it found an error in a 2017 VA examination.  Based on the deferred rating decision, the AOJ ordered additional development.  

In August 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision.  In it, the AOJ purported to grant service connection for a cervical strain effective January 6, 2018.  However, as illustrated above, the AOJ has already service connected the Veteran's cervical strain in January 2018.  The AOJ, in contrast to the January 2018 rating decision, granted a 10 percent rating effective January 6, 2018.  It notified the Veteran of the rating decision on August 15, 2023.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Citing decision notification dates of June 27, 2023 and August 15, 2023, the Veteran appealed both the June 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions.  However, given the procedural history, the August 2023 rating decision subsumed the June 2023 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board finds the August 2023 rating decision alone is on appeal.  The August 2023 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

Because the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Procedural History - Knees

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in June 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level in June 2023, review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Issue 1: From January 6, 2018, entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a cervical strain 

The Veteran, through his representative, contends his cervical strain warrants a higher rating, as the 10 percent rating is not reflective of the significant activity restrictions the veteran was experiencing nor did the VA examiners adequately address any additional functional loss based on the Veteran's testimony.  See Attachment 1 to the June 2024 VA Form 10182.  

Under the AMA, the Board may only remand an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2)?AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. ?See?38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).? 

Having reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that remand for pre-decisional duty to assist errors is required.

First, the AOJ examined the Veteran four times during the period on appeal - August 2017, August 2020, December 2020, and July 2023.  The Veteran did not report using medication to treat his cervical strain at the August 2017 or August 2020 examinations.  However, he reported such usage at the two most recent examinations.  In December 2020, the examiner noted the Veteran used "Mobic 15mg daily, Hydrocodone 5-325ng q 4hr PRN, Cyclobenzaprine 5mg 1-2 tabs q3 times daily PRN."  In July 2023, the examiner noted the Veteran used "Cervical epidural, Zanaflex 2 mg PRN, Mobic 15 mg PRN."  These statements trigger the Board to consider the potential ameliorative effects of the pain medication based on Jones v. Shinseki, 26?Vet. App.?56 (2012) and Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327.  

In Jones, the Court held that VA committed legal error when it considered the ameliorative effects of medication on the appellant's disability where those effects were not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria.  Thus, the Court held that where a Diagnostic Code is silent as to the effects of medication, VA may not deny entitlement to a higher disability rating based on the relief provided by medication. Id.  In Ingram, the Court held that Jones applies to VA's review of ratings under the diagnostic codes for rating musculoskeletal disabilities.  The Court also held that, with regard to these and other diagnostic codes that do not reference medication, "the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation."  The Court noted the Board must inquire, for example, "whether [a Veteran's] ROM improved with medication use, and, if so, to what extent" and "whether flare-up frequency lessened with medication and, if so, to what extent." 

Based on this caselaw, the Board finds the AOJ erred in not obtaining a VA examination that addresses the aforementioned questions.  Therefore, remand is warranted for a new examination under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Second, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) authorizes eligible Veterans to receive health care from a community provider rather than waiting for a VA appointment or traveling to a VA facility.  This authorization includes the former Veterans Choice Program and current Veterans Community Care Program.  

Here, VHA approved the Veteran for the Community Care Program, as indicated in VA treatment records added to the claims file on October 19, 2021 and September 22, 2022.  Indeed, VHA has referred the Veteran to community providers for his cervical strain.  VA's duty to assist the Veteran in prosecuting his claims includes obtaining such records.  Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Because the AOJ did not obtain these records, this violated 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  As such, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Lastly, the Board highlights the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  In it, the Veteran requested "the AOJ [take] corrective measures to include appropriate imaging studies and a clarification addendum for additional functional loss based upon the veteran's historical statements." As these contentions were raised after the rating decision on appeal, the Board may not order any development, but the AOJ is encouraged to consider these contentions while the appeal is remanded for development. 

Issue 2: Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome, right knee

Issue 3: Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome, left knee

The Veteran, through his representative, contends the AOJ failed to acknowledge the full extent of the Veteran's testimony regarding the extent of his functional loss and appropriate compensation, to include discussing separate ratings for a single knee disability when limited range of motion, instability and/or degenerative changes are present.  See Attachment 1 to the June 2024 VA Form 10182.  

Remand is warranted for two reasons. 

First, in December 2020, 11 months prior to the Veteran's November 2021 increased rating claim, a VA provider prescribed "Diclofenac Gel, Top 1%" for the Veteran to use on his knees, with a maximum daily usage of 16 grams per area per day.  Also, the AOJ examined the Veteran once during the period on appeal in March 2022.  The examiner noted the Veteran used "meloxicam 15mg, duloxetine 60mg QD" to treat his knees.  As above, these statements trigger the Board to consider the potential ameliorative effects of the pain medication based on Jones and Ingram.  

Based on this caselaw, the Board finds the AOJ erred in not obtaining a VA examination that addresses the aforementioned questions.  Therefore, remand is warranted for a new examination under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Second, as noted above, VHA approved the Veteran for the Community Care Program, as indicated in VA treatment records added to the claims file on October 19, 2021 and September 22, 2022.  Indeed, VHA has referred the Veteran to community providers.  One such provider is the University Pain Clinic of Rochester.  It is unclear if this facility treated the Veteran for his knees.  However, because the AOJ did not clarify this by obtaining these records, this violated 38 U.S.C. § 5103A.  As such, remand is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Lastly, the Board highlights the Veteran's VA Form 10182.  In it, the Veteran requested "the AOJ [take] corrective measures to include appropriate imaging studies and a clarification addendum which opines on additional functional loss, based on the veteran's description of activity limitations." As these contentions were raised after the rating decision on appeal, the Board may not order any development, but the AOJ is encouraged to consider these contentions while the appeal is remanded for development.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Attempt to obtain all treatment records generated from VHA's approval of the Veteran to seek treatment via the Veteran's Community Care Program.   Arrange for these documents to be made viewable in VBMS and/or added as separate files.  In short, the Board wants to ensure that all available records are viewable, not simply a notation that private records have been scanned into a VHA database.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and severity of his cervical strain.  The examiner must review the claims file including this Remand.  In addition to the customary examination, the examiner must also address the following: 

a)	The examiner must identify, with reasonable specificity, the medications the Veteran has used to treat his pain for his back disability since January 6, 2018, the effective date of the grant of service connection.  

b)	Then, the examiner should answer the following questions:

a.	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's pain medications provide greater range of motion for the Veteran's cervical strain than he would have if he did not take them?  Why or why not?

b.	Assuming the answer to (a) is yes, the examiner should attempt to estimate the Veteran's range of motion with medication usage and range of motion without medication usage from January 6, 2018 to the present.  In opining, base your estimate on information procured from relevant sources, including the lay statements the Veteran provides after he is asked to describe functional limitation.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

3. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and severity of his bilateral knee disability.  The examiner must review the claims file including this Remand.  In addition to the customary examination, the examiner must also address the following: 

a)	The examiner must identify, with reasonable specificity, the medications the Veteran has used to treat his pain for his bilateral knee disability since November 2020, one year prior to his November 2021 increased rating claim.  

b)	Then, the examiner should answer the following questions:

a.	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's pain medications provide greater range of motion for the Veteran's bilateral knee disability than he would have if he did not take them?  Why or why not?

b.	Assuming the answer to (a) is yes, the examiner should attempt to estimate the Veteran's range of motion with medication usage and range of motion without medication usage from November 2020, one year prior to his November 2021 increased rating claim, to the present.  In opining, base your estimate on information procured from relevant sources, including the lay statements the Veteran provides after he is asked to describe functional limitation.  

A complete rationale must be given for all opinions and conclusions expressed.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without resorting to mere speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
