REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED), claimed as secondary to medication taken for service connected left ankle instability and or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is remanded.

Entitlement to compensation pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1982 to January 1990.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that denied service connection for ED. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for ED, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that even though the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) has not elapsed, a docket switch waiver letter (see Williams v. McDonough, No. 21-7363, U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024) is not necessary as the Veteran's representative has submitted a November 2024 appellate brief in which he stated that submission to the Board was for final review and disposition.  Moreover, the Veteran indicated in his formal application that he is running out of funding.  The Board infers from these statements that the Veteran wishes expeditious review of the claim and forego the remaining time period during which he can switch dockets.  Unfortunately, for the reasons below, a remand is required before the Board can adjudicate the claim on the merits.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is remanded.

In disability compensation claims, VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies; and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). The threshold under McLendon is low.  Similarly, a claim for compensation for additional disability under 38 U.S.C.A. § 1151 constitutes a disability compensation claim and 38 U.S.C.A. § 5103A(d) applies.  Trafter v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 267, 280 (2013).

In this case, the Veteran contends that he has ED caused by VA care.  See June 2024 VA-526 EZ fully developed claim form.  The Board infers from this statement that he claims his ED is caused or aggravated by medication that he has been prescribed for his service-connected left ankle sprain residuals and gastroesophageal reflux disorder.  This is a valid theory of entitlement.  See, e.g., Wanner v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 4, 8 (2003) (noting that "the Board awarded service connection for tinnitus as 'the result of treatment for a service-connected disability'"), rev'd on other grounds, 370 F.3d 1124 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 157 (1998) (discussing "an implicit secondary-service-connection claim that his gastrointestinal disorder was the result of, inter alia, pain medication taken for his service-connected right-shoulder condition"); Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137 (1994) (reviewing Board's denial of service connection for glaucoma as secondary to treatment for blepharoconjunctivitis).

The Veteran's statement that he has ED caused by VA care also raises the issue of entitlement to compensation pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151.  Bonds v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 445 (2022) (declining to address whether a claim under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 can be read to incorporate a claim for service connection or vice versa but instead instructing the Board to assess generally whether an informal claim has been raised).  Under this statute, compensation is warranted for disability cause by VA care where the VA care caused the disability and the proximate cause of the disability was VA Fault in furnishing the care.

VA treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with ED as early as 2004 as an October 2004 VA treatment record shows diagnosis of ED, and he has a current diagnosis of ED as a June 2024 VA treatment record shows that the Veteran is prescribed medication to treat his ED. Additionally, the Veteran is service-connected for left ankle sprain residuals and gastroesophageal reflux disorder, and is prescribed medication for treatment of these disabilities. Thus, the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran may have a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability that may be associated with a service-connected disability, to include treatment or medication taken therefor. As the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim, remand based on this pre-decisional duty to assist error is warranted to obtain a VA opinion as to the etiology of his ED, whether secondary to service-connected disabilities or due to VA care and fault on the part of VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) (providing that AMA remands may be based on pre-decisional duty to assist errors or any other errors in satisfying a statutory or regulatory duty).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Request an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the following:

(a) whether the Veteran's ED is caused or aggravated a service-connected disability, to include medication taken therefor and 

(b) whether the Veteran's ED was caused by VA care and the proximate cause of the disability was VA fault in furnishing the care. 

If an examination is deemed necessary, one should be conducted.

The clinician must review the evidence including the Veteran's lay statements that symptoms such as a difficulty getting erections, beginning in approximately 2004 and becoming more difficulty since their onset. 

Then, the clinician should opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that ED is caused by service-connected left ankle sprain residuals or GERD, including medications taken therefor OR (3) is aggravated (i.e., made worse to any degree) by service-connected left ankle sprain residuals or GERD, including medications taken therefor.  If aggravation is found, the baseline level of the ED prior to aggravation should be noted, if possible.

The clinician should also opine as to whether any VA  hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, caused his ED and the proximate cause of the disability was carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination.

The claims file should be provided to and reviewed by the clinician.

A complete rationale should accompany any opinion provided.
