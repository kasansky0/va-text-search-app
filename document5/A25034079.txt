ORDER

The August 4, 2023, Supplemental Claim seeking review of the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, that denied entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) was untimely and the request for an extension of time to file a request to review the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, is denied.

Entitlement to a TDIU based on service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted effective August 4, 2023.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's August 4, 2023,VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim was not timely with respect to the rating decision issued March 7, 2022, that denied a TDIU; the Veteran's August 2023 Supplemental Claim was not submitted concurrent with or prior to the May 2023 request for an extension of time to file a request for review of any rating decisions issued between March 19, 2019, and June 10, 2023; and good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file a request for review of the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, based on the August 2023 request for an extension of time. 

2. Granting the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD alone prevented him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation effective August 4, 2023. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an extension of time to file a review option with respect to the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500.

2. The criteria for a TDIU based on PTSD alone have been met effective August 4, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from September 1966 to September 1969. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 26, 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Notification of the rating decision was issued on May 6, 2024. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 12, 2023 notification of the December 2023 rating decision which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that in October 2024, the Board sent correspondence to the Veteran notifying him of his right to select a different review option within one year from the date of the April 2024 HLR rating decision or within 60 days of the date the Board received his September 2024 VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In November 2024, the Veteran signed and submitted a waiver of his remaining time to select a different Board option.

1. Entitlement to a TDIU

2. Timeliness of the August 2023 Supplemental Claim with respect to the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a TDIU from October 26, 2021, the date of his original TDIU claim. In the September 12, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran asked the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) to consider his TDIU claim, originally submitted in an October 26, 2021 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability, and then resubmitted in an August 4, 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim. 

The Veteran's original October 2021 TDIU claim was denied in a March 2022 rating decision. Notification was sent to the Veteran's last known address on March 7, 2022. The Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182 with the Board or a supplemental claim or higher-level review request with the AOJ within one year of the March 7, 2022, notification of the rating decision. Therefore, the March 2022 rating decision became final.

On May 2, 2022, the Veteran appointed a new representative, an attorney with the Cameron firm. On May 20, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim listing heart disease, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. On October 20, 2022, the Veteran attended a VA examination for his heat claim. The Veteran then filed a claim for service connection for hypertension on April 14, 2023. Also on April 14, 2023, the AOJ denied the heart claim; however, the notification letter was returned to sender. On May 2, 2023, the record shows that the Veteran declined to attend a VA examination for the hypertension claim due to COVID-related concerns. On May 12, 2023, the AOJ sent notification of a May 11, 2023, rating decision that again denied service connection for a heart problem. 

On May 15, 2023, the Veteran's representative requested an extension of time to request review of any rating decisions issued between March 19, 2019, and June 10, 2023, and asked that the extension request be considered for any pending claim or appeal. The representative stated that the Veteran was invoking the AOJ's policy regarding extension requests based on COVID-19. 

On June 2, 2023, the record shows that the Veteran cancelled a VA examination for hypertension. A June 9, 2023, Report of General Information shows that VA attempted to contact the Veteran regarding two missed appointments but there was no answer and a voicemail message was left. A rating decision issued on June 15, 2023, granted service connection for hypertension at zero percent effective April 14, 2023. 

On the same day, June 15, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting service connection for erectile dysfunction secondary to hypertension and service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus. He also submitted another Supplemental Claim on June 15, 2023, requesting review of the May 2023 rating decision that had denied service connection for heart problems. 

On July 18, 2023, the Veteran appointed a different attorney from the Cameron Firm as his representative. 

On August 4, 2023 the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim requesting review of the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, that had denied entitlement to a TDIU. The Supplemental Claim asked the AOJ to please reference the COVID-19 time limit extension requested dated May 17, 2023. Another Supplemental Claim with identical assertions was submitted on September 11, 2023. 

A rating decision issued on November 1, 2023, adjudicated the Veteran's June 15, 2023, Supplemental Claims, granting service connection for tinnitus, congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy, erectile dysfunction, special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound criteria, SMC based on loss of use of creative organ, and eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) and denying service connection for bilateral hearing loss. Within the reasons and bases, the AOJ found that the claim for service connection for heart problems had been continuously pursued and assigned a 100 percent rating for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy and SMC housebound both effective April 14, 2023. 

A rating decision issued on December 12, 2023, adjudicated the Veteran's August 4, 2023, Supplemental Claim for a TDIU, finding that new and relevant evidence had been presented to warrant readjudication, but that the TDIU claim was moot. The reasoning was that the Veteran had a single disability rated at 100 percent, SMC housebound, and no potential entitlement to an earlier effective date for a TDIU was warranted by the evidence of record. 

On December 22, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. 

On that form, the Veteran's representative asserted that the Veteran filed a VA Form 8940 on October 26, 2021, requesting a TDIU, which was denied in a rating decision issued on March 7, 0222. The representative noted the Veteran had filed a Supplemental Claim on August 4, 2023, seeking review of the March 2022 rating decision and citing to the May 17, 2023, request for an extension of time. The representative asserted that the request was made in good faith due to the COVID-19 pandemic and that it was reasonable and equitable for the VA to consider the August 2023 Supplemental Claim as timely, and thus that the claim for a TDIU had been continuously pursued since October 26, 2021. 

The Veteran's representative also asserted that a TDIU was not moot because receipt of a 100 percent rating does not necessarily moot TDIU, citing Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). The representative noted that the Veteran was rated 70 percent for PTSD during the period prior to his receipt of a 100 percent rating for congestive heart failure and asserted that the Veteran should be granted a TDIU based on his PTSD symptoms.

On January 24, 2024, the AOJ sent the Veteran a letter stating that if he wanted to file a claim for a TDIU, he needed to file it on the proper form. However, in a Higher-Level Review rating decision issued on May 6, 2024, the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's HLR request and again found that the claim for a TDIU was moot. The AOJ considered VA Policy Letter 20-02 and concluded that the request for an extension of time to review the March 2022 rating decision that denied TDIU was received after the expiration of the time limit to maintain continuous prosection and, thus, the claim itself must have been submitted concurrently or prior to the request for extension, as instructed in the Policy Letter. Here, the claim was received more than two months after the request for an extension of time was submitted, therefore, the extension request was deemed invalid and the claim for a TDIU was not continuously pursued. The AOJ then concluded that the earliest possible effective date for a TDIU would be August 4, 2023, the date of receipt of the TDIU claim. Because the Veteran was rated 100 percent disabling for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy from April 14, 2023, no earlier effective date for a TDIU was possible and entitlement to a TDIU was moot. 

On June 4, 2024, the Veteran filed a HLR request seeking review of the rating decision issued on November 1, 2023. A HLR rating decision issued on September 18, 2024, found there was clear and unmistakable error in the assignment of the effective date for service connection for hypertension, congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy, SMC housebound, and DEA eligibility. The decision assigned an earlier effective date of August 10, 2022, the effective date of the law on which the grant of service connection for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy was based, for each award.

On September 20, 2024, the Veteran filed the relevant VA Form 10182, seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on May 6, 2024. The Veteran's representative repeated the same assertions from the December 2023 HLR request.  

Based on the above, the Veteran's primary contention is that entitlement to a TDIU is not moot. The Veteran's representative appears to rely on the assertion that a TDIU could be warranted prior to the August 4, 2023, effective date of the 100 percent rating for congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy, and thus should not be considered moot. The Board notes that the Veteran is now in receipt of a 100 percent rating for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy effective August 10, 2022. Similarly, SMC housebound has also been granted effective August 10, 2022. Thus, the Board reasonably infers that the Veteran's assertion would now be that entitlement to a TDIU could be warranted prior to the August 10, 2022, assignment of the 100 percent rate for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy. 

The Veteran's representative cited to Bradley v. Peake, in which the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a TDIU award satisfies the statutory total rating requirement in 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350, which contain the criteria for SMC housebound benefits. Therefore, because the Secretary is required to maximize benefits, a grant of TDIU based on a combination of service-connected disabilities does not moot TDIU if a TDIU based on a single disability would entitle a claimant to SMC benefits. Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294. In Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011) (holding that TDIU is a rating and that a combined rating does not satisfy the requirement of a total rating for SMC purposes). 

As noted above, the Veteran is rated 100 percent for congestive heart failure with cardiomyopathy effective August 10, 2022. SMC was granted effective August 10, 2022, under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) because the Veteran had a single disability rated at 100 percent and PTSD that was independently ratable at 60 percent. The Veteran is service connected for PTSD at 70 percent from August 26, 2013, tinnitus at 10 percent from June 15, 2023, and erectile dysfunction at zero percent effective June 15, 2023. The Veteran's representative asserts that entitlement to a TDIU is not moot because he was not granted a 100 percent rating prior to August 10, 2022, and asks the Board to consider whether a TDIU is warranted based on his PTSD prior to August 10, 2022, stemming from his October 26, 2021, TDIU claim. 

The Board found above that the March 2022 rating decision that denied an increased rating for PTSD and denied a TDIU became final because the Veteran did not seek any kind of review within the one-year appeal period. While the Veteran's representative asserts that the AOJ should have granted his request for an extension of time to file a request for review of the March 2022 rating decision, the Board finds that an extension was not warranted. 

Notification of the March 2022 rating decision was sent to the Veteran's last known address, and to his representative at the time, on March 7, 2022. It was not returned to sender and the Veteran has not asserted that he did not receive it. As noted above, on May 15, 2023, the Veteran's representative requested an extension of time to file a review request with respect to any rating decision issued between March 19, 2019, and June 10, 2023. At the time of the extension request, the Veteran had not submitted any request for the AOJ to review the March 2022 rating decision. He did not submit a Supplemental Claim requesting such review until August 4, 2023. 

While the Veteran did include an extension request in the August 4, 2023, Supplemental Claim, it was submitted after the COVID-19 national emergency had ended and after the period to which the AOJ's Policy Letter 20-02 applied. Thus, it did not comply with the requirement of 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) that, "[w]here an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit." The May 2023 extension request, while submitted prior to the expiration of the COVID-19 national emergency and when the AOJ was still applying Policy Letter 20-02, was not submitted concurrent with the August 2023 Supplemental Claim, and no request for a review of a decision on a TDIU had been submitted prior to the May 2023 extension request. 

Further, even considering the Veteran's August 2023 request for an extension of time under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b), generally, the record does not establish good cause for why the Veteran could not have requested review of the March 2022 decision during the one-year appeal period or earlier than August 2023. The Veteran was represented during the one-year appeal period and filed several claims for other issues during the one-year appeal period. He filed a supplemental claim in May 2022, requesting readjudication of a claim for service connection for heart disease, including myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. The Veteran attended a VA examination for that claim in October 2022. He then filed a claim for service connection for hypertension in April 2023. While he declined to attend a VA examination in May 2023, he then filed two more supplemental claims in June 2023, one for service connection for erectile dysfunction, hearing loss, and tinnitus and the other requesting review of the May 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for heart problems. Thus, based on the above, the Veteran was not prevented from filing multiple claims and requests for review of previously denied claims during the one-year appeal period, and prior to August 4, 2023, when he filed his Supplemental Claim for TDIU, requesting review of the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022.

Based on the above, the Board finds that good cause was not shown to extend the time to file a request to review the rating decision issued on March 7, 2022, that denied a TDIU and thus affirms the AOJ's denial of the Veteran's May 2023 and August 2023 extension requests. 

Accordingly, the TDIU claim before the Board in this appeal stems from the August 4, 2023, Supplemental Claim that requested a TDIU. 

Here, the Veteran's representative has asserted that a TDIU should be granted based on PTSD alone. The Board acknowledges that if the Veteran is eventually service connected for other disabilities, entitlement to a TDIU based on a single disability could allow the Veteran to qualify for ancillary benefits in the future. Therefore, the Board will not dismiss TDIU as moot and will adjudicate entitlement to a TDIU based on a single disability. 

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). 

The determination as to whether a veteran can secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation includes an economic component and a noneconomic component. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component requires that a veteran not earn annual income from employment outside of a protected environment in excess of the poverty threshold for one person, as established by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. Stated differently, earned annual income below the poverty threshold will generally be considered evidence of marginal employment and satisfy the economic component of TDIU. Marginal employment may also be held to exist on a facts-found basis, including, but not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop, when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. The existence of unemployment or marginal employment does not automatically allow for TDIU. Rather, the pertinent inquiry turns to consideration of the noneconomic component.

The noneconomic component of TDIU requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow substantially gainful employment, including factors such as the veteran's history of education, skill, and training, as well as his or her ability to perform the physical and mental activities required by the occupation in question. See Ray, supra. Specific physical ability factors include lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory, and visual. Id. Specific mental ability factors include memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle workplace stress, getting along with coworkers, and demonstrating reliability and productivity. Id.

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of service-connected disabilities on the ability to secure and follow substantially gainful employment. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). For VA purposes, the term unemployability is synonymous with an inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2317 (1992). Consideration may be given to the level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion. Individual unemployability, however, must be determined without regard to any nonservice-connected disabilities or advancing age. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341 (a), 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If the evidence persuasively weighs against a claim, the claim is denied.

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities for the period on review include the following: (i) congestive heart failure (CHF) with cardiomyopathy associated with hypertension rated 100 percent from August 10, 2022; (ii) PTSD rated 70 percent from August 26, 2013; (iii) tinnitus rated 10 percent from June 15, 2023; (iv) hypertension rated 0 percent from August 10, 2022; and (v) erectile dysfunction associated with PTSD, rated 0 percent from June 15, 2023. Based on the Veteran's 100 percent rating for CHF, effective August 10, 2022, and his 70 percent rating for PTSD from August 26, 2013, the Veteran has been awarded SMC(s)(1) benefits from August 10, 2022. 

The Veteran meets the schedular criteria for TDIU for the period on review. 38 U.S.C. § 4.16(a). 

Turning to the merits of the Veteran's claim, with respect to the economic component, the record shows that the Veteran has not worked since approximately 2010. In the September 2024 representative Arguments, the Veteran's representative stated that The Veteran worked in security for a resort for 7 years until he was no longer able to work. In his October 2021 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability, the Veteran reported that he worked 40 hours/week for Rancho California R.V. Resort from 2003-2010. In a November 2014 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported that he had retired from his job as chief of security at the resort, which he had worked at for seven years. See November 2014 PTSD Examination and Report. The Veteran has thus satisfied the economic component of TDIU. Ray, supra.

Turning to the noneconomic component, with respect to education, skills and training, in the September 2024 Representative Arguments, the Veteran's representative stated that the Veteran graduated high school and only attended one year of college. In the service, the Veteran worked in military police. See DD Form 214. After the military, the Veteran worked as a landscaper, painter, and other odd jobs. In a December 2021 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran reported that he had completed one year of college. Before the military, he worked on the docks in Cleveland with a trucking lines. After the military, he worked with Pinkerton Security and Sherwin-Williams freight company. See December 2021 VA PTSD Examination and Report. In the November 2014 VA PTSD Examination and Report, the Veteran reported that he had a high school degree and some college. He retired from his job as chief of security at a resort, which he had for seven years. He also worked as a landscaper, dock worker, painter and other odd jobs. He also worked as a dialysis technician and briefly as an undercover technician for Pinkerton. Based on his education, skills, and training, the Board finds that the Veteran is suited to positions similar to the jobs he held in the past, to include security and oversight-related positions that do not require advanced education or training. 

With regard to the Veteran's ability to perform the physical and mental activities required by the occupations in question, in the September 2024 Representative Arguments, the Veteran's representative asserted that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms had a profound impact on employability. The Veteran's panic attacks can be debilitating and interfere with his ability to perform effectively in a work environment. The unpredictable nature of these attacks would make it difficult for him to reliably fulfill job responsibilities. His hypervigilance creates an environment of constant anxiety. In a workplace setting, this can lead to an inability to focus on tasks and adversely impact productivity. Chronic sleep impairment not only affects his overall health, but it also contributes to increased irritability and exacerbate his difficulties in concentrating and his memory as he indicated is an ongoing issue. His inability to maintain effective social/work relationships would make working in an office setting extremely difficult. According, to the representative, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms, together with his limited education, highlight the profound challenges the Veteran faces with obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment, and that given the totality of the circumstances, TDIU is warranted due to his service-connected PTSD. 

In the December 2021 VA PTSD Examination and Report, the Veteran reported that he continues to have ongoing symptoms of PTSD. He has panic attacks often, but less than weekly. He cannot go to Walmart anymore due to crowds and cannot shop in crowded stores. He experiences exaggerated startle response and hypervigilance and he cannot have anyone behind him. He has poor social relationships particularly in unfamiliar settings and he is hypervigilant in new settings where he cannot stay long. He has problems with concentration and memory. The examiner attributed the following symptoms to the Veteran's PTSD: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; chronic sleep impairment; flattened affect; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. The examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

In the November 2014 VA PTSD Examination and Report, the examiner associated the following symptoms with the Veteran's PTSD: depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks that occur weekly or less often; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting. The examiner summarized the Veteran's level of occupational and social impairment with regard to his PTSD as occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood.

VA treatment records also evidence the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and their impairment of his ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. For example, in a July 2022 VA Psychiatry Attending Note, the Veteran reported being easily startled, guarded in public and crowded places which trigger his anxiety. In a December 2021 VA Psychiatry Attending Note, the Veteran reported that due to anxiety sleep an issue, unable to sleep. In a November 2020 VA Psychiatry Attending Note, the Veteran reported he was having lots of anxiety.

Based on the evidentiary record and granting the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected PTSD alone. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; Lynch, supra. The Veteran's statements, the representative's arguments, the December 2021 and November 2014 VA PTSD Examinations and Reports, and the Veteran's VA treatment records provide a reliable summary of the Veteran's mental and emotional symptoms and their impact on his ability to function in an occupational environment. The evidence shows that the Veteran was limited by his PTSD symptoms to an occupation requiring little stress, little interaction with others, little strain on his memory, focus, and concentration or any other mental and emotional capacities impaired by his chronic sleep problems. Given this disability picture, the Board is unable to conceive of a position outside of a protected environment that would have accommodated the Veteran's functional limitations during the period on review, to include positions suited to the Veteran's education and training, such as his previous security-related positions. Accordingly, the Board grants the Veteran TDIU based on PTSD alone. Ray, supra; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

Because the Veteran failed to continuously pursue his October 26, 2021 TDIU claim, one year prior to the August 4, 2023 date of claim of the Veteran's subsequent VA Form 20-0995 is the earliest possible effective date for any award of TDIU. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007) (a claim for TDIU is a type of increased rating claim); 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) ("[t]he effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date"). However, the evidence in this case establishes that the worsening that resulted in unemployability due to PTSD alone was factually ascertainable earlier than August 4, 2022, one year prior to the August 4, 2023, Supplemental Claim. The Veteran has been rated at 70 percent for PTSD since August 26, 2013, and asserted entitlement to a TDIU based on PTSD in his October 26, 2021, TDIU claim, which listed only PTSD and tinnitus as the cause of the Veteran's unemployability. He stated in that claim that he had last worked in 2010 and that he was prevented from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation due to his PTSD. VA examinations and treatment records from 2014 forward show that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms have resulted in functional limitations that impacted his occupation, as described above. 

Accordingly, applying the benefit of the doubt, a TDIU based on a single disability, PTSD, is granted effective August 4, 2023.
