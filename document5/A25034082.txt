ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The weight of the evidence shows that the Veteran's right shoulder disability is not etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right shoulder disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2009 to December 2009.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office (RO). 

In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  The Board notes that the Veteran did not specify as to which rating decision she was appealing.  However, the April 2024 rating decision is the only rating decision that adjudicated a service connection claim for a right shoulder disability within one year prior to the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  As such, the Board has construed the Veteran's VA Form 10182 as intending to appeal the April 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision on appeal.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran also included the issues of service connection for migraines and a left shoulder disability on the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  However, in a July 2024 letter, the Board informed the Veteran that the migraine claim was untimely.  Additionally, the left shoulder disability is currently a part of a separate appeal stream and will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

Finally, in the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, although the RO found that relevant evidence had not been submitted, it still essentially readjudicated the claim on the merits.  As the claim was implicitly readjudicated by the RO in the April 2024 rating decision, the Board will adjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability.

Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is denied.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

On the April 2022 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran sought service connection for a right shoulder condition.  The Board notes that she indicated that she was in receipt of service connection for a leg disability but did not state that she was claiming her right shoulder disability on a secondary basis.  On a June 2023 Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran claimed that her right shoulder had popped out and had continued to do so.  

In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found that the Veteran had a diagnosis of a right shoulder disability.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain any findings, complaints, or treatment related to the right shoulder.  In September 2009 and November 2009, the Veteran reported that she was not experiencing any right shoulder issues.  See April 2022 JLV/MTF.  While she noted that she previously experienced a popping of the right shoulder, she did not indicate that such occurred during service and there is no documentation of such instances.  In November 2009, the Veteran declined to undergo a separation examination.  See December 2009 STR.

A March 2022 private treatment record noted inflammation of the Veteran's bilateral trapezius muscle.  See April 2022 Medical Treatment Record - Non Government Facility.  

In April 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination.  See June 2022 C&P Exam.  The examiner noted a diagnosis of right rotator cuff tendonitis.  The Veteran reported that she injured her right shoulder during a training exercise while on active duty.  

The Board finds that service connection for this condition is not warranted.  The weight of the evidence shows that the claimed disability is not related to the Veteran's active duty.  Indeed, there is no competent evidence of record indicating that the diagnosed condition is due to any disease or injury from military service.  

The Board notes that the Veteran has not attributed her right shoulder disability to any specific in-service event, injury, or disease.  While she has indicated that her right shoulder would pop out, and later attributed the condition to a training injury, there is no documentation of any such occurrences in the service treatment records.  Indeed, the Veteran denied any symptoms related to her right shoulder on several occasions during active duty.  The remainder of the record is silent regarding any probative evidence that this condition is related to an in-service event. 

The Board finds that the record does not include probative evidence linking the Veteran's right shoulder disability to service and no evidence has been submitted in support of the claim.  Furthermore, the Veteran's lay opinion concerning such matters requiring medical expertise is not competent evidence of the alleged nexus.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Rather, the most probative evidence of record indicates no in-service treatment or complaints of the claimed disorder and no diagnosis of a right shoulder disability until more than a decade after her separation from service, which weighs against a finding that she has a right shoulder disability that is related to her military service.

The Board notes that the Veteran attended a VA examination for her right shoulder disability, but that an opinion was not provided addressing direct service connection.  As there is no indication in the evidence that the condition is related to service or an associated condition beyond the Veteran's assertion, there is no duty to obtain an addendum nexus opinion.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); see 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

As such, the weight of the evidence is against entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability.  Reasonable doubt does not arise, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply; the Veteran's claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
