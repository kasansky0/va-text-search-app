ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right fifth metacarpal fracture residuals is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for left carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left foot condition, to include arthritis and plantar fasciitis, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for right foot condition, to include arthritis and plantar fasciitis, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for right CTS, to include as due to a right fifth metacarpal disability, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is in receipt of the only rating available for his service-connected right (dominant) fifth metacarpal disability; the persuasive medical evidence does not indicate the Veteran's disability should be considered under different rating criteria; and the disability has not manifested with symptoms not contemplated by the applicable rating criteria.

2. The Veteran's left hand CTS was diagnosed in service and is not attributable to intercurrent causes.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that an acquired psychiatric disability or bilateral foot condition began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for the Veteran's right fifth metacarpal fracture have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5230.

2. The criteria for service connection for left CTS have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for a left foot condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

5. The criteria for service connection for a right foot condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1983 to April 1991. 

In the August 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider regarding those claims granted or denied, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim regarding right CTS, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in adjudicating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right fifth metacarpal fracture residuals is denied.

The Veteran maintains that his right fifth metacarpal disability manifests with symptoms severe enough to warrant a compensable rating.  He is currently rated at 0 percent, or noncompensably, effective in December 2016.  See June 2017 rating decision.  As this rating has been on appeal since the award of service connection, the severity of the disability will be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limited motion requires considering functional loss due to pain or other factors that occurs during flare-ups or after repeated use and therefore, may not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  Consideration is also given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Even when factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant to disability evaluation, ratings are assigned based on the extent of limited motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  A separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  Additionally, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 allows for consideration of functional loss due to painful motion to be rated to at least the minimum compensable rating for a particular joint.

The Veteran's disability is evaluated in accordance with rating criteria articulated in Diagnostic Code (DC) 5230.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Some rating criteria applicable to musculoskeletal disabilities were revised, effective February 7, 2021.  DC 5230 was not altered by that revision.  

Under DC 5230, any limitation of motion for the ring or little finger is noncompensable.  The maximum - and only - available rating under DC 5230 is 0 percent.  

The Board is accordingly legally bound to deny an appeal for a compensable rating where no compensable rating is available under applicable criteria.  See Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 480 (2016), citing Beverly v. Nicolson, 19 Vet. App. 394, 402 (2005) ("DC 5230's specific finding that there is no impairment in earning capacity from any limitation of motion of the ring finger trumps the general intent in § 4.59 to compensate painful motion with at least the minimum compensable rating").  DC 5230 fully contemplates the extent of the Veteran's right fifth metacarpal disability, to include the effect of functional loss and flare-ups.  See Frazier v. McDonough, 66 4th 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2023).  

The medical evidence of record indicates ongoing hand pain and numbness, sometimes associated with his fifth metacarpal disability but more often associated, by the Veteran and his providers, as related to CTS.  See, e.g., October 2016, February 2019 correctional facility medical records.  A June 2017 VA examination indicates ongoing, throbbing pain and discomfort, without flare ups.  The Veteran reported taking over the counter anti-inflammatories for symptom management.  He also reported functional loss in grip strength and dexterity, making writing difficult.  He evinced reduced range of motion, without pain on motion, at the examination.  There was no additional lost motion or impairment on three repetitions, although the VA examiner stated that he could not offer an opinion regarding additional, unobserved lost motion over time without resorting to speculation.  

The Veteran submitted a personal statement indicating ongoing difficulty writing and hand pain in February 2020.  At an October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported sharp pain and grinding sensations with use of his right fifth finger while working.  His pain increased with repetitive movements and weather changes.  He evinced reduced motion, with pain on motion, on examination.  The Veteran attested to functional loss due to pain.  

In sum, the record reflects pain and lost motion in the right fifth finger during the entire period on appeal.  These symptoms are consistent with the noncompensable rating already assigned.  The Veteran has not reported, and the record does not reflect, involvement of any other fingers related to this disability, as could warrant an increased rating or rating under a different diagnostic code.  See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333 (2015) (holding that "a listed condition should be rated under the DC that specifically pertains to it").  The Veteran also has not attested to, and the medical record does not indicate, complete immobility of the right fifth finger.  As such, consideration of "functional" ankylosis, or immobilization, of the joint is not for application.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  Notably, ankylosis of the fifth finger also has a maximum noncompensable rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5227.  

The Board is likewise cognizant that the record indicates use of pain medication to relieve symptoms related to this disability.  See, e.g., June 2017 VA examination.  Rating determinations must discount the ameliorative effects of medication in examining symptoms severity.  Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 (March 12, 2025), citing Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  However, as the rating criteria applicable to this claim do not allow for a greater or compensable rating regardless of pain symptoms or severity, the Board does not find remand warranted to evaluate the effects of pain medication in relation to this disability.  

The Board also does not find evidence of right fifth finger not accounted for by the rating criteria, including surgical intervention during the period on appeal, finger amputation, or hospitalization due to this disability.  As such, extraschedular consideration for the Veteran's right fifth metatarsal disability is not warranted.  Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008); 38 C.F.R. § 3.321.

The Veteran's disability is already awarded the highest rating afforded under law, for the entire period on appeal.  Moreover, the Board cannot award a compensable rating where there is no compensable rating available under applicable diagnostic criteria.  Frazier, 66 4th 1353.  In light of the governing authority, the Board finds that a compensable rating for the Veteran's right fifth metacarpal disability cannot be awarded as a matter of law because DC 5230 does not allow for a compensable rating regardless of the limitation of motion.  Id.; see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).  This claim is accordingly DENIED. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for left carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is granted.

The Veteran maintains that he has bilateral CTS due to military service, including as due to his right fifth metacarpal disability.  See December 2016 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim; August 2022 Form 10182.  The rating decision on appeal reflects binding, favorable findings that he has a current diagnosis for bilateral CTS; that he was diagnosed with left CTS during service; and that CTS is available for presumptive service connection as a chronic condition.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Service connection is granted for disabilities resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty or other qualifying military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  There are three requirements to establish service connection: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic disabilities, including CTS, may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period post service (one year for CTS).  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  For diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), service connection may be established by showing continuity of symptomatology.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

The favorable findings in this case establish in service diagnosis of and treatment for left hand CTS in December 1984, and a current diagnosis of the same.  CTS is included on the list of chronic diseases enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), and when a chronic disease is shown in service, "subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

There is accordingly sufficient, competent evidence in support of finding that the Veteran's left CTS manifested during active duty service, and that he has a current diagnosis for the same condition.  Service connection for left hand CTS as a chronic disability is accordingly GRANTED.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

3. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is denied.

The Veteran maintains that he has an acquired psychiatric condition, including PTSD, due to military service.  See December 2016 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim; August 2022 Form 10182.  The rating decision on appeal reflects binding, favorable findings that he was treated for injuries from a personal assault during active duty, and that psychosis may be presumptively service connected as a chronic condition.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Service connection is granted for disabilities resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active duty or other qualifying military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  There are three requirements to establish service connection: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

According to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), service connection for PTSD, in particular, requires: (1) medical evidence of a diagnosis of the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), meaning in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); (2) a medically established link between the current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  Establishing a current disability requires evidence of the disability at the time of or during the pendency of the claim, regardless of whether it since has resolved.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  In the absence of proof of a present disability there necessarily can be no valid claim because, for all intents and purposes, there is no current disability to in turn relate or attribute to the Veteran's military service.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992)

Despite the AOJ's finding that the Veteran suffered a personal assault in service, the record does not reflect a diagnosis of or treatment for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  In July 1990, a year prior to his separation from service, the Veteran underwent a mental health evaluation that found no history of symptoms and no then-current mental health indicators.  A March 2008 health intake at incarceration indicated no current psychiatric indicators, although the Veteran reported treatment for depression in 1986.  He later clarified that his psychiatric treatment in service was related to his divorce.  See August 2009 correctional facility mental health records.  He reported being told that he was manic depressive in 1986.  The August 2009 provider found no indication of current depression or mania, or further need for treatment.  

The Veteran was afforded an April 2022 VA psychiatric examination that found no current psychiatric diagnosis.  The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran reported feelings of sadness that were related to his crime and incarceration, rather than experiences in service.  However, in the examining psychologist's view, those reports did not amount to a current diagnosis.  As such, the record does not reflect any psychiatric diagnosis, including one for PTSD, during the period on appeal. 

These findings are unrefuted on record, including by the Veteran's reported feelings of sadness.  The Board is cognizant that the AOJ's July 2022 favorable finding indicated that a psychosis may be awarded presumptive service connection.   For VA compensation purposes, psychosis is defined as a brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and substance and/or medication-induced psychotic disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 3.384.  There is no indication of concern for or diagnoses of any of these psychoses anywhere on record.

A veteran is generally competent to report experiences and symptoms of which he has personal knowledge, including his own symptoms and describing those symptoms to providers.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  His symptom reports are accordingly competent.  However, the Veteran is not competent to assert that his symptoms evince a psychiatric condition.  Diagnosing the claimed conditions is a medically complex issue, requiring knowledge of pathology to make a medical assessment.  Id.  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, none of which indicates a current diagnosis for the claimed disability.  

For these reasons and bases, the record on appeal does not support finding a current diagnosis for a psychiatric condition.  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  As the evidence for versus against this claim is not in approximate (nearly equal) balance, there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor, and this claim consequently must be DENIED.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). 

4. Entitlement to service connection for left foot condition, to include arthritis and plantar fasciitis, is denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for right foot condition, to include arthritis and plantar fasciitis, is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he has bilateral plantar fasciitis due to active duty service.  The July 2022 rating decision on appeal made binding favorable findings that the Veteran was treated for left foot and ankle pain during service; that he has current diagnoses of bilateral plantar fasciitis and foot arthritis; and that arthritis is a chronic condition for the purposes of presumptive service connection.  The Board additionally finds evidence of a right ankle injury in May 1989, and use of a brace for treatment.

As above, service connection may be awarded where there is proof of a current disability, the disease or injury in service, and a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden, 381 F.3d 1163.  As stated, arthritis is a chronic disease for the purposes of presumptive service connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Fountain, 27 Vet. App. 258.  

The record does not indicate any diagnosis of or treatment for arthritis or plantar fasciitis during service, despite his injuries.  These diagnoses first appear on record in October 2010 correctional facility medical notes.  At an October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran stated that his plantar fasciitis symptoms began sometime in 1990.  The record does not indicate foot complaints at that time.  Although the VA examiner confirmed the Veteran's current diagnoses, he found insufficient evidence to relate them to service, citing a lack of supporting medical evidence.  

These findings are unrefuted on record, including by the Veteran's reported symptom onset in 1990.  As above, although he is competent to report his symptoms, he has not been shown to have the medical training or experience to diagnose his claimed conditions.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.  The Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence disassociating the Veteran's claimed conditions from service.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  

As such, the record does not reflect probative evidence of a causal nexus between the Veteran's active duty service and his claimed condition.  The Board also does not find evidence of a per-decisional error or statutory duty to justify remanding this claim for additional development.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  There is not an approximate balance of evidence for versus against the Veteran's claimed bilateral foot plantar fasciitis or arthritis as attributable to service.  The evidence weighs persuasively against his claim and the claim is therefore DENIED.  Lynch, 999 F.3d 1391; Ortiz, 274 F.3d 1361. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right CTS, to include as due to a right fifth metacarpal disability, is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he has CTS in the right hand because of active duty service, including as due to his right fifth metacarpal disability.  A pre-decisional duty to assist error was made in failing to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion, requiring remand to remedy.   

The Veteran was afforded an October 2021 VA examination and medical opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the claimed condition.  The VA examiner concluded it was less likely than not that the claimed right CTS was due to the service connected right fifth metacarpal disability, but did not opine as to whether the service connected disability aggravated his right CTS.  The medical opinion is accordingly inadequate, and a remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136 (2013).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action(s):

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's right hand CTS is at least as likely as not related to service, including as due to or aggravated by his service connected right fifth metacarpal fracture residuals.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
