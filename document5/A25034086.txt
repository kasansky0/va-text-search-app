ORDER

An effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is denied.

An effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to October 9, 2020, the Veteran was substantially and gainfully employed; the evidence is persuasively against a finding that his employment at that time was marginal.

2. The criteria for basic eligibility for Chapter 35 (DEA) benefits were not met prior to October 9, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of a TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

2. The criteria for an effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits under Chapter 35 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 2003 to May 2003, and from July 2003 to September 2003. He also had service in the Army National Guard, to include a period of active duty for training from June 2002 to September 2002. His decorations include the Army Achievement Medal. 

The rating decision underlying the present appeal was issued in June 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. Following a further denial on Higher-Level Review in October 2023, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in January 2024, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a final introductory matter, the Board notes that the Veteran was previously represented by a private attorney. However, the Veteran revoked the power of attorney in favor of that representative by a statement received in February 2024. He is currently proceeding pro se.

1. An effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of a TDIU is denied.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a TDIU, effective October 9, 2020. On appeal, he seeks an earlier effective date for the award. Specifically, the Veteran, through his former representative, has asserted that he should have been assigned an effective date of September 25, 2019. See, e.g., July 2023 Request for Higher-Level Review. It has been contended that the TDIU issue should be recognized as part and parcel of an earlier-received claim involving the rating of major depression with generalized anxiety, pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

As a threshold matter, the Board agrees that the date of claim in this case is September 25, 2019. The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder on that date, and the claim was subsequently granted in a July 2020 rating decision, effective September 25, 2019. The Veteran sought review of the rating assigned for the disorder, raised the issue of his entitlement to a TDIU while the claim for a higher rating for the psychiatric disorder was pending, and has continuously pursued the matter since. As such, the Board will consider his entitlement to a TDIU throughout the period from September 25, 2019, to October 8, 2020. See Rice, supra (if, in connection with making a claim for the highest rating possible for a disability, a claimant submits evidence of a medical disability, and evidence of unemployability, the matter of the claimant's entitlement to a TDIU is considered a component of the claim for a higher rating).

A TDIU is warranted where the evidence of record shows that a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, consistent with his education and occupational experience, as a result of service-connected disability, without regard to advancing age. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). Provided, however, that if there is only one such disability, the disability must be rated at 60 percent or more, and that if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

In determining the effective date for a TDIU award, it must be determined when it was factually ascertainable that service-connected disability rendered the veteran unemployable. As with any claim for VA compensation, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any matter material to the claim, the claimant shall be given the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

In the present case, the record shows that the Veteran is in receipt of a 70 percent rating for major depression with generalized anxiety from September 25, 2019. As such, he has met the criteria for consideration of a TDIU on a schedular basis since that date. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Turning to the merits of the claim, the Veteran does not dispute that he was employed prior to October 9, 2020. On his April 2022 VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability), he reported that he last worked in October 2020. He indicated that he had been employed as a tour guide beginning in August 2020, working 30 hours per week with a monthly salary of $2,050. His employer certified on a VA Form 21-4192 (Request for Employment Information in Connection with a Claim for Disability Benefits) that the last day he worked was October 8, 2020. Prior to that employment, he had worked full time as a laborer from November 2019 to July 2020, with a reported monthly salary of $2,447, and prior to that he was employed in a retail position from January 2019 to June 2019, with a reported monthly salary of $3,197.

On appeal, the Veteran maintains that he should be awarded a TDIU for the period on appeal prior to October 9, 2020, because, although he had employment during that time, his employment was marginal. He asserts, in essence, that his work from August 2020 to October 2020 should be considered a failed work attempt, as the work was temporary, seasonal, and less than 40 hours a week.  He has also indicated that he was fired from that position.

Under applicable law, for TDIU purposes, "[m]arginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). The regulation states:

For purposes of this section, marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination.

Id. The Court has defined "employment in a protected environment" to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 124 (2024).

The Board notes that the poverty threshold for 2019 for one individual under the age of 65 was $13,300. See https://www.census.gov/ data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html. In 2020, the threshold was $13,465.

On review of the available evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's employment during the period from September 25, 2019, to October 8, 2020, was marginal. By his own report, he earned $3,197 per month from January 1, 2019, to June 1, 2019; $2,447 per month from November 1, 2019, to July 1, 2020; and $2,050 per month from August 1, 2020, to October 1, 2020. Those figures translate into an annual income of approximately $20,879 for 2019, and $18,785 for 2020. See also earnings report provided by the Veteran in April 2022 (showing taxed Social Security earnings of $23,298 in 2019 and $21,234 in 2020). Those amounts are clearly in excess of the relevant poverty thresholds for those two years.

The Board acknowledges, as noted previously, that marginal employment may be held to exist on a facts-found basis when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Here, however, nothing in the record indicates that the Veteran's employment during the period at issue was in a protected environment such that, due to his service-connected disability, he was shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market. To the contrary, the Veteran has indicated, and the record supports, that he was released from his employment when his performance fell below expectations. See, e.g., VA Form 21-4192 received in May 2022 (indicating that the Veteran was terminated from his most recent employment from August 2020 to October 2020 as a result of being tardy/absent without leave).

Because the evidence persuasively establishes that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not preclude him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation during the period on appeal prior to October 9, 2020, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is inapplicable. The appeal of this issue must be denied.

2. An effective date prior to October 9, 2020, for the award of basic eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits for the child or surviving spouse of a veteran may be established if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

In this case, the Veteran is still living. Therefore, the only legal basis for establishing basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits is his having a permanent and total service-connected disability. As stated above, the Board has concluded the Veteran is not entitled to such a rating (i.e., a TDIU) prior to October 9, 2020. Accordingly, there can be no award of basic eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits prior to that date. The appeal of this issue must also be denied. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
