ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU)  is dismissed as moot.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has been in receipt of a permanent and total schedular rating (100 percent) due to service connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with alcohol abuse for the entire period on review. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran's claim of entitlement to a TDIU is moot. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1989 to September 1989, from May 2004 to August 2005, and from July 2008 to May 2010, with service in Afghanistan.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

By way of history, the Veteran previously claimed a TDIU due to his service connected PTSD with alcohol abuse. See September 2015 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940). In a December 2015 legacy rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU as the Veteran was found capable of gainful employment. In September 2016, the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement to the December 2015 rating decision. In April 2017, the Veteran, through his representative, withdrew in writing the issue of entitlement to a TDIU; the AOJ acknowledged the Veteran's withdrawal in an April 2017 letter and discontinued processing the Veteran's appeal of the December 2015 rating decision. The Veteran did not respond to the April 2017 letter and did not otherwise indicate that the withdraw of appeal was in error. The Veteran submitted a new claim for entitlement to a TDIU in November 2023. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182 that forms the basis of the instant appeal, the Veteran indicated disagreement with the December 2015 rating decision which denied entitlement to a TDIU. The Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely with respect to the December 2015 legacy rating decision, and as discussed above, the Veteran withdrew his prior appeal of this rating decision in 2017. Therefore, an appeal of the December 2015 rating decision is not before the Board. However, after a careful review of the record, the Board notes that a March 2024 AMA rating decision adjudicated the issue of entitlement to a TDIU. As the March 2024 AMA rating decision is timely with respect to the July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Board has liberally construed the Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182 as a timely appeal of the March 2024 rating decision which denied entitlement to a TDIU. 38 C.F.R §§ 19.2,  20.202.

Finally, the Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In this case, a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R.            § 20.202(c)(2) as it is more than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, and it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the July 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Entitlement to a TDIU is dismissed as moot.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to a TDIU and contends that his service connected PTSD with alcohol abuse prevents him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. See November 2023 VA Form 21-8940.  A March 2024 rating decision determined that the Veteran's November 2023 claim for entitlement to individual unemployability was moot because the Veteran's service connected disabilities were evaluated as 100 percent disabling and no potential entitlement to an earlier effective date for a total disability evaluation based on a grant of individual unemployability was warranted by the evidence of record. The March 2024 rating decision made no favorable findings.

The Veteran's PTSD with alcohol abuse has been service connected since May 30, 2010 and rated as totally disabling (100 percent) since December 30, 2016. The Veteran also has additional service connected disabilities rated as less than totally disabling: left foot degenerative changes with 2nd metatarsal cortex prominence continuously rated at 20 percent, tinnitus continuously rated at ten percent, and hearing loss continuously rated at zero percent from May 30, 2010. See, e.g., March 2024 Rating Decision-Codesheet. In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ confirmed and continued the Veteran's eligibility for Dependents Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Ch. 35, finding that Veteran had a permanent, total service connected PTSD with alcohol abuse, effective September 11, 2020, that the Veteran's overall combined rating was 100 percent, and there was no evidence showing that the Veteran's disability was likely to improve. 

It is the established policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The law provides that total disability ratings may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one such disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

The Court has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a veteran is totally disabled. See Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990). Generally, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled because of a particular service-connected disability or a combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001).

A claim for a TDIU based on a condition that has already been service connected is a claim for an increased rating. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). The period of review for an increased rating claim is the period from which the entitlement arose, or the date of the receipt of claim, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R.  § 3.400(o)(1). An exception to that rule provides that the effective date of an award of an increased disability rating shall be the earliest date on which it can be ascertained that an increase in disability had occurred, if the claim is received within one year from such date - otherwise known as the "one-year look-back" period. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Here, the Veteran's service connected PTSD with alcohol abuse has been rated as totally disabling (100 percent) since December 30, 2016 and as permanently and totally disabling since September 11, 2020. VA received the Veteran's claim for a TDIU on November 21, 2023 and the earliest possible effective date VA could assign to a grant of the benefit claimed would be November 21, 2022. To be eligible for a grant of a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 at any time, the Veteran's schedular rating must be less than total. In this case, the Veteran's schedular rating for PTSD with alcohol abuse has been total since December 30, 2016 and permanent and total since September 11, 2020. Thus, there is no time during any part of the review period has the Veteran's schedular rating has been less than total. As the Veteran has been found to be totally disabled pursuant to the rating schedule for the entire period on review, there is no authority to otherwise rate the Veteran as totally disabled on any other basis, and the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is rendered moot. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Herlehy v. Principi, supra.

In reaching this determination, the Board acknowledges that there are some circumstances for which a grant of a 100 percent disability rating does not render the issue of TDIU moot; however, those circumstances are not present here. 

The Court has held that VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to determine whether any combination of a Veteran's disabilities establishes eligibility for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). The special monthly compensation provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) is payable where the veteran has a single service connected disability rated as 100 percent and has at least one additional service connected disability independently ratable at least 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. In Bradley, the Court held that 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total" rating for purposes of special monthly compensation. This means that when a veteran is awarded a TDIU based on a single disability and also receives schedular disability ratings for other conditions, special monthly compensation based on the statutory criteria may be awarded so long as the same disability is not counted twice, i.e., the same disability may not be counted both as a basis for TDIU and as a basis for the criteria of a separate disability rated at 60 percent or more disabling. See 75 Fed. Reg. 11,229, 11,230 ; Summary of Precedent Opinions of the VA General Counsel (March 10, 2010) (withdrawing VAOPGCPREC 6-1999 in light of Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280 ).

Thus, under the holding in Bradley, a veteran with a 100 percent schedular rating for a single service connected disability could nevertheless be awarded a a TDIU based on a different disability in order to meet the special monthly compensation requirements under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(1) (one 100 percent rating plus one 60 percent rating), provided that the veteran's separate disability, or combination of disabilities, otherwise meets the criteria for a grant of a TDIU. In such circumstances, a grant of a TDIU could meet the special monthly compensation requirements by either: a) increasing a single disability rating of less than 60 percent to at least 60 percent, in a case such as here where a separate 100 percent rating is already established, or b) increasing a single disability that is less than 100 percent to a "total" (100 percent) rating, in a case where there is already established a combination of other ratings that meet the separate 60 percent rating requirement for special monthly compensation. See Buie at 249-50. 

Here, consideration of a grant of a TDIU to establish eligibility for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is not warranted. The Veteran has not alleged that any service connected disability other than PTSD with alcohol abuse renders unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation nor does the evidence of record suggest that the Veteran's left foot degenerative changes, bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, either alone or in combination, renders him unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation. While the Veteran has been awarded a TDIU based on his PTSD with alcohol abuse, he does not have service connected disabilities that are separately rated as 60 percent disabling. Therefore, special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for statutory housebound benefits is not warranted.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU is moot as the Veteran has been in receipt of a permanent and total schedular rating (100 percent) due to service connected PTSD with alcohol abuse for the entire period on review. As there is no authority to rate the Veteran as totally disabled on any other basis, the appeal dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.
