ORDER

The issue of eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Due to the death of the Veteran, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits is unachievable as both the Veteran and the Primary Family Caregiver applicant are precluded from completing and complying with all applicable requirements of the program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal for eligibility of PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 71.10-71.60.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the Marine Corps from January 1969 to October 1970.  

The Veteran passed away in March 2023.  The appellant in this case is the Veteran's widow, P.P., and joint applicant for PCAFC benefits.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision on appeal was issued in August 2021; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the August 2021 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2021 VHA decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the August 2021 VHA decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The issue of eligibility for benefits under the PCAFC

The appellant contends that she is entitled to benefits under the PCAFC as she asserts that the Veteran required personal care services due to pain and limited functional capacity caused by a back condition.  See VA Form 10182, July 2022.

The appellant along with the Veteran applied for benefits under the PCAFC in October 2020.  

A March 2021 VA Caregiver Support Program (CSP) PCAFC Centralized Eligibility and Appeals Team (CEAT) Review Consult concluded that the Veteran was ineligible for benefits under the PCAFC.  The March 2021 decision was subsequently upheld by CSP in August 2021 and January 2022 decisions.  The Review Consult determined that the Veteran did not require personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months based on an inability to perform an activity of daily living (ADL) and or a need for supervision, protection, or instruction. 

The Veteran and appellant submitted a VA Form 10182 to the Board in July 2022 appealing the denial; however, the Veteran subsequently died in March 2023.  

PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers.  38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).  Eligibility under the PCAFC program requires a finding that an eligible Veteran is in need of personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months from an eligible caregiver because of (1) an inability to perform one or more activities of daily living (ADLs); (2) a need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury; or (3), a need for regular or extensive instruction or supervision without which the ability of the Veteran to function in daily life would be seriously impaired.  38 U.S.C. § 1720G(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 71.20(a).   

The criteria under § 71.25 require that, before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must (1) be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training, and (2) complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f), final approval and designation for the Caregiver Program benefits will be conditioned on the Veteran and caregiver "remaining eligible" for Caregiver Program benefits, including the caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements.

Here, due to the Veteran's March 2023 death, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits cannot be achieved as the Primary Family Caregiver Applicant is no longer providing care to the Veteran and neither the Veteran nor the Primary Family Caregiver Applicant are able to comply with the applicable requirements for PCAFC benefits to include the Home Care Assessment, caregiver training, or any other required assessments or reassessments.  Final approval and designation did not occur prior to the Veteran's death, and it is not feasible for the Veteran and Primary Family Caregiver Applicant to complete and comply with all applicable requirements of the program due to the death of the Veteran.  Accordingly, the issue of eligibility for PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f); see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994) (providing in a case where the law is dispositive of the claim, the claim should be denied for lack of legal merit under the law).

The Board acknowledges that the appellant submitted a VA Form 21P-534EZ, Application for DIC, Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits in April 2023.  However, in an April 2023 Notification Letter, the VA denied the appellant's request for accrued benefits because the VA did not owe any money to the Veteran at the time of his death.  The Board affirms this finding.     

The Board finds that under 38 U.S.C. § 5121(a), accrued benefits are periodic monetary benefits to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions or those based on the evidence in the file at date of death and due and unpaid.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(a).  However, here, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits did not occur prior to the Veteran's death and eligibility for PCAFC benefits had not been established under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25.  Thus, there were no PCAFC benefits which were due and unpaid at the time of the Veteran's death.  Consequently, there are no accrued benefits which the appellant is entitled to receive.  38 U.S.C. § 5121(a).  

Although sympathetic to the appellant's claim, the Board finds that the Veteran's death precludes initial eligibility for PCAFC.  The Board finds that, under these circumstances, there is no potential avenue by which the eligibility requirements for PCAFC benefits may be granted.  Therefore, the issue of eligibility for PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
