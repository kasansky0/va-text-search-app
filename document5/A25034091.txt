ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for the period on appeal prior to June 23, 2022, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the period on appeal prior to June 23, 2022, the Veteran's GERD, manifested with infrequent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain; it did not more nearly approximate symptoms that were productive of considerable impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD, prior to June 23, 2022, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army and Army National Guard from June 2005 to October 2006, with three months and thirteen days of active service, and from May 2007 to June 2008, all of which was active duty.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a June 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA timely received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), in October 2024, electing the Board's Direct Review docket.

The Board is cognizant of the AOJ's later assignment of a 30 percent disability rating for GERD, effective from June 22, 2023.  As the review period for the present appeal ends on the date of the rating decision (June 23, 2022), the Board will only address this period.

Applicable Evidentiary Window

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran has not filed such a request.  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for GERD, for the period on appeal prior to June 23, 2022, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his service-connected GERD.

Applicable Law

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

A veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski,1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). If later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). In determining an initial rating, the entire record from the effective date of service connection to the present is of importance in determining the proper rating of disability, and staged ratings are to be considered in order to reflect the changing level of severity of a disability during this period. See Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126.

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Id.: Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed. Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided; separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See 38C.F.R. §4.14; see also Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal. VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b). It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's GERD has been rated analogously to Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346, for hiatal hernia. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114; see 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. While this matter was pending, amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 became effective on May 19, 2024. 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (Mar. 20, 2024). The amendments added a specific Diagnostic Code for GERD, DC 7206. In this case however, the evidentiary record closed in June 2022 and thus the prior rating by analogy is for application.

Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the rating assigned; additional code is shown after the hyphen. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. The use of DC 7399-7346 reflects that there was no DC specifically for GERD during the period on appeal, and that the disability has been rated by analogy to hiatal hernia under DC 7346. The disability is rated by analogy under a DC for a closely related disability that affects the same anatomical functions and has closely analogous symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20, 4.27. DC 7399 is a general reference to the rating criteria for disabilities of the digestive system, and DC 7346 rates hiatal hernia. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346:

A 10 percent rating is warranted if the claimant experiences two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

A 60 percent rating is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis (vomiting of blood) or melena (black, tarry feces associated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage) with moderate anemia (a decreased number of red blood cells); or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

The rating criteria does not define the terms "considerable" or "severe." However, the term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012).

A key difference between a 10 percent and 30 percent rating is the severity of the symptoms, with a 10 percent rating having symptoms of less severity and a 30 percent rating having symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. A veteran can have some or all the symptoms listed in the criteria for a 30 percent rating but if they are not productive of considerable impairment of health then they do not warrant a 30 percent rating.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under diagnostic codes 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. A single evaluation will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation. Id.

In assigning a rating under Diagnostic Code 7346, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating.  See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (stating that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

Analysis

All of the lay and medical evidence of record has been reviewed in conjunction with the applicable laws and regulations, and a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.

Treatment records show that the Veteran did not complain of gastric symptoms.  See e.g., June 2019 VA treatment note (Veteran did not experience abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, reflux or epigastric discomfort).

In October 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination, wherein his diagnosis of GERD was continued.  The Veteran reported his symptoms had worsened over the years since onset.  At that time, he claimed to experience reflux twice per day, nightly heartburn or GERD symptoms four times per week, and the need to sleep on his side to avoid the reflux causing him to feel as if he were choking.  He also reported taking over-the-counter medications and consuming a baking soda solution with meals to mitigate his GERD symptoms.  The examiner noted infrequent symptoms of epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, pain (substernal, arm, and shoulder), sleep disturbances occurring four or more times per year and lasting between one to nine days, nausea occurring four or more times per year and lasting less than a day, and vomiting occurring four or more times per year with symptoms lasting less than a day.  The examiner did not endorse material weight loss, hematemesis, melena with moderate anemia, or symptoms productive of considerable or severe impairment of health.  The Veteran reported losing zero to one week of work in the prior year due to his GERD symptoms. There was no indication that the VA examiner considered the ameliorative effect of the Veteran's medication.

On consideration of the entire record, the Board does not find evidence of GERD symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health prior to June 23, 2022.

A higher 30 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 is not warranted unless there is persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  A key difference between a 10 percent and 30 percent rating is the severity of the symptoms, with a 10 percent rating having symptoms of less severity and a 30 percent rating having symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.  As noted above, "considerable" is defined as large in extent or degree.  The probative evidence of record for the period on appeal shows infrequent symptoms of epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, pain (substernal, arm, and shoulder), sleep disturbances, nausea, and vomiting.  

The medical record and the Veteran's lay statements prior to his October 2021 VA examination do not indicate material weight loss, anemia, hematemesis, melena, increased treatment or medications, or anything else that would indicate considerable impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346.  The Board additionally does not find any indication of hospitalizations, increased medication, weight loss requiring medical intervention, or evidence that the Veteran is unable to maintain employment due to symptoms, as could imply severe impairment in health.  Id.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms he has personally experienced, including those that could establish entitlement to a higher disability rating.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372.  However, the Veteran has not asserted any specific severity of symptoms demonstrating entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to June 23, 2022.  As no such assertions are reflected on record, and the only medical findings reflecting symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health appear after the period on appeal, this claim for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is denied.
