DOCKET NO. 210326-226622
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ambulance services for episode of care June 13, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) reported the initial denial was overturned and the claim was processed for payment for the episode of care on June 13, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA ambulance services for episode of care on June 13, 2020, is moot. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.52, 17.120, 17.121, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2021 determination made by a VHA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the March 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The Board acknowledges that the appellant submitted evidence with his March 2021 VA Form 10182 while selecting the direct review docket.  Generally, in this circumstance the Board is required to seek clarification from the appellant as to whether they wished to switch to the evidence submission docket.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  However, as discussed below, given that there is no matter in dispute since the instant appeal has been rendered moot, the Board finds that clarification of the appellant's docket selection is not necessary.  Therefore, the Board will continue to review this matter under the direct review docket.  

Dismissal

The appellant sought reimbursement for non-VA emergency ambulance services for the episode of care on June 13, 2020.  The AOJ initially denied the claim because the Veteran had Other Health Insurance the covered a portion of the emergency treatment.  See February 2021 Explanation of Payment (EOP).

During the pendency of this appeal, the claim was administratively reviewed, and the record reflects the claim for episode of care on June 13, 2020, was denied in error; the claim was resurrected and approved for payment.  See February 2022 VA Form 119, Report of Contact.  The record reflects payment was issued to the appellant in February 2022.  As the VHA has overturned its initial denial and approved the ambulance transportation expenses on June 13, 2020, there is no decision for appeal.  

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5), the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  As there remains no adverse action with regards to the episode of care, there is no case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate, and the appropriate course of action is to dismiss the present appeal as to this date as moot.  Cardona v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 472, 474 (2014) (citing Padgett v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 159, 164 (2008) (en banc)).
