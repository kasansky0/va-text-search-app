The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dental services provided by the appellant on August 10, 2021, (Claim ID 302203900048778000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment for the August 10, 2021, episode of care provided to the Veteran by the appellant.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment for non-VA dental services provided on August 10, 2021, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Affordable Dentures & Implants, is a non-VA dental provider that furnished dental services to the Veteran on August 10, 2021.?

In March 2022, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct review docket to review decisions issued by a VA Medical Center for the August 10, 2021, episode of care.

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA dental care provided to the Veteran on August 10, 2021, was approved while this appeal was pending.  In a January 2022 Explanation of Payment, VA informed the appellant that the claim regarding this episode of care had been granted and $1,080.00 had been paid under Claim ID 302200500054495000.  As explained in the October 2023 Report of Contact, the claim was paid on January 13, 2022, in the amount of $1,080.00.  

The Board acknowledges that the payment may be less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the August 10, 2021, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

[CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE]

The January 2022 decision approving entitlement to payment for the August 10, 2021, episode of care constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
