ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 50 percent for obstructive sleep apnea (sleep apnea) is denied. 

Entitlement to a separate rating for bronchial asthma is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's sleep apnea is the predominant disability; his sleep apnea has not manifested in chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or requires tracheostomy. 

2. The Veteran's bronchial asthma has not manifested as FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation greater than 50 percent for the predominant disability of service-connected sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.

2. The criteria for a separate rating for bronchial asthma as the predominant disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 3.400, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.96, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1989 to July 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In an October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, under the Appeals Modernization and Improvement Act (AMA), the Veteran elected Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the related claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran and his spouse have stated that his symptoms of sleep disturbance have negatively affected his ability to work, making it "extremely difficult" to work, and that trouble sleeping has led to him missing work.  See March 2024 VA Form 21-10210, A.C., July 2024, January 2025 VA Mental Health Notes.  However, during the review period on appeal, through the October 2022 rating decision, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran was employed.  Therefore, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU was not raised by the record during the review period on appeal. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009).

1. Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 50 percent for sleep apnea.

2. Entitlement to a separate rating for bronchial asthma.

The Veteran was granted service connection and an initial 10 percent evaluation for asthma in an October 1993 rating decision and denied entitlement to an increased evaluation in a December 1995 rating decision.  

On August 11, 2022, VA received the Veteran's intent to file followed by an August 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ that included a claim for service connection for sleep apnea secondary to his service-connected asthma.  The Veteran was granted service connection for sleep apnea with an initial 50 percent evaluation in an October 2022 rating decision that explained his current evaluation had been previously rated as bronchial asthma.  The Veteran was notified of the October 2022 rating decision, and within a year, filed the current appeal to the Board.  Based on the foregoing procedural history, because the Veteran filed a new claim for sleep apnea, which was evaluated as the predominant disability over his previously service-connected bronchial asthma, the review period for the Veteran's increased evaluation for sleep apnea begins on August 11, 2022, the date of the Veteran's intent to file, with a one-year look back period for any increase in the severity of his previously service connected bronchial asthma.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), (3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(1), (2), 3.2500; see also Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

The Veteran contends that his service-connected sleep apnea and asthma disabilities have been more severely disabling than reflected by the current evaluation, and it was error to combine the ratings for his service connected sleep apnea with the rating for his service connected asthma because the two specified ranges of diagnostic codes are stated in the disjunctive, and he is entitled to "independent compensation ratings" for asthma and sleep apnea.  See October 2022 VA Form 10182, October 2022 Letter in Support of VA Form 10182.  He specifically contends that his separate rating for bronchial asthma should not have been discontinued when he was granted service connection for sleep apnea secondary to his service-connected bronchial asthma, and it should be reinstated because the two conditions are "separate and distinct".  See November 2022 Written Brief Presentation.   

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate rating codes identify the various disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind.  See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  For increased rating claims, "the present level of disability is of primary concern." See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58.  However, each disability is viewed "in relation to its history" to "accurately reflect the elements of disability present," respectively.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1 and 4.2; see also Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 62 (2012).  "Staged" ratings may be assigned when the evidence shows distinct periods during the evaluation period when manifestations of the disability warranted varied ratings.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2009).  

The Veteran's bronchial asthma was previously rated at 10 percent from July 6, 1993, under 38 C.F.R. 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.  From August 11, 2022, the Veteran was assigned a single rating for sleep apnea, previously rated as bronchial asthma, and is currently rated at 50 percent under 38 C.F.R. 4.97, Diagnostic Codes 6602-6847.  

Prior to addressing the Veteran's entitlement to an evaluation greater than 50 percent for sleep apnea, the Board will first address his contention regarding entitlement to a separate additional rating for asthma.

Respiratory conditions are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97 and are subject to the special provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.96.  These special provisions state that ratings under diagnostic codes 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be combined with each other, and a single rating will be assigned under the diagnostic code which reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a).  Therefore, rather than separately evaluating the Veteran's respiratory conditions and then combining them under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25, as VA generally does for other conditions, this regulation has been interpreted to mean that VA will evaluate coexisting service-connected respiratory conditions covered by § 4.96(a) under a single rating based on the criteria for the predominant disability.  See Urban v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 82, 89-90 (2017).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reliance upon a different interpretation of the language of 38 C.F.R. § 4.79 in a prior Board decision to support his contention; however, each decision by the Board is necessarily based on review of the evidence of record in a particular claims file and has no precedential value toward adjudication of appeals by other claimants, even those who may appear to be similarly situated.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303; see also Lynch v. Gober, 11 Vet. App. 22, 27 (1997); Hillyard v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 349, 351 (1991).  Notably, the prior Board decision relied upon by the Veteran predated the precedential decision upholding the prohibition against assigned separate ratings for asthma and sleep apnea in Urban, supra. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a separate, or additional disability rating for his bronchial asthma because 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a) bars the simultaneous award of separate ratings under Diagnostic Codes 6602 and 6847, and instructs that a single rating will be assigned under the Diagnostic Code that reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  Id.  As the Veteran claimed entitlement to an evaluation greater than 50 percent for his sleep apnea, he is presumed to be seeking the maximum possible evaluation.  Therefore, the Board will address his entitlement to a higher evaluation for asthma, or for sleep apnea, as his predominant disability.  See A.B. v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1992).

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran does not contend, nor does the evidence show, that the symptoms of service-connected asthma warrant an increased evaluation, or an evaluation greater than 10 percent if evaluated separately.  As previously outlined, as of the October 2022 rating decision, the Veteran's asthma was rated at 10 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6602.  To be considered the predominant disability, the symptoms of the Veteran's bronchial asthma would need to meet the criteria for an evaluation greater than the 50 percent currently assigned for his sleep apnea.  This would require evidence of pulmonary function tests results showing Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) or spirometry results of Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) showing FEV-1 of 40 to 55-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations or intermittent (at least three per year) course of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids to warrant the next-higher 60 percent rating.  

Pulmonary function test results are generally reported before and after the administration of bronchodilator therapy.  VA regulations require the use of post-bronchodilator results in determining disability ratings for Diagnostic Codes 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845, unless post-bronchodilator results are poorer than pre-bronchodilator results.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4).

There are no regulations specifying whether pre- or post-bronchodilator results should be used when determining disability ratings under Diagnostic Code 6602. Therefore, as the Veteran has not been diagnosed with bronchitis, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or restrictive lung disease, the Board finds that the special provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 4.96(d), including pulmonary function tests, are not required, and it will use the more favorable results.

However, as previously noted, the Veteran did not file an increased rating claim for his service connected bronchial asthma, nor is there evidence of worsening in the record within the one year period prior to his August 11, 2022, intent to file.  See Gaston, 605 F.3d at 984.  Rather, the most recent treatment record addressing the Veteran's asthma symptoms prior to his August 2022 claim for service connection for sleep apnea are VA treatment records from September 2018, and these include a letter from his primary care provider notifying him that his September 2018 VA pulmonary function test was normal and advising him to discontinue his asthma medications, including mometasone and albuterol.  See September 2018 VA Physician Letter, September 2018 VA Primary Care Notes.  While the Veteran is competent to observe his asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath, he does not have the training or credentials to determine the current nature and severity of those symptoms in conjunction with the applicable diagnostic criteria.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  At no point in the review period was there evidence that the Veteran's asthma symptoms warranted an evaluation greater than the 50 percent assigned at the time he was service connected for sleep apnea; therefore, the Board finds his sleep apnea was the predominant disability. 

Turning next to the Veteran's sleep apnea symptoms, the Board finds that an evaluation greater than 50 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's sleep apnea, as the predominant disability.  

Sleep apnea syndromes (obstructive, central, mixed) are rated under Diagnostic Code 6847, which provides for a noncompensable rating if sleep apnea is asymptomatic, but with documented sleep disorder breathing; a 30 percent evaluation when there is persistent daytime hypersomnolence; a 50 percent evaluation when the veteran requires the use of a breathing assistance device, such as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine; and a 100 percent evaluation for chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or for cases where the Veteran requires a tracheostomy.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.

During the October 2022 VA sleep apnea examination, the examiner indicated that the Veteran required the use of a CPAP machine, had persistent daytime hypersomnolence, with heavy snoring and apnea without the use of a CPAP, but opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea did not impact his ability to work.  

The Board has also considered whether the criteria for a 100 percent rating for sleep apnea has been met at any time during the review period.  However, at no point during the review period do the Veteran's medical records show that the severity of his symptoms warrants a higher evaluation; specifically, there is no indication that the Veteran's sleep apnea has been productive of chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention, cor pulmonale, or that the Veteran requires a tracheostomy.  Accordingly, an evaluation greater than the 50 percent currently assigned for sleep apnea is not warranted. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions that his obstructive sleep apnea is more severe than contemplated by the current rating assigned.  While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as daytime somnolence, he is not considered competent to medically attribute or assess the severity of his obstructive sleep apnea as required in the Diagnostic Code.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that his sleep apnea disability is more severe than it is currently evaluated but finds that neither the Veteran's statements nor the medical evidence demonstrates that the criteria for a higher rating has been met.  Nor does the evidence demonstrate that the Veteran's asthma or sleep apnea disabilities present such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).  Rather, the Veteran has reported that he "does ok" at work and feels rested, and only has a hard time when his CPAP comes off, about once a month, and then is "very tired, but able to perform his job." See October 2022 VA Sleep Apnea Examination.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's sleep apnea symptoms are contemplated by his current evaluation.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that a rating greater than 50 percent is not warranted at any point during the review period for the Veteran's service-connected sleep apnea or bronchial asthma disabilities, as the evidence presented during the review period does not reflect symptoms that warrant the next higher 60 percent rating for bronchial asthma, or the 100 percent rating for sleep apnea.  As the evidence of record persuasively shows that the Veteran's sleep apnea and asthma symptoms do not meet or approximate the criteria for the next-higher ratings under Diagnostic Codes 6602 or 6847 at any time during the review period, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.  Therefore, the appeal for an increased rating is denied.
