ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss disability was incurred in or otherwise related to his military service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus began during service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from May 1968 through June 1970.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which was the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that this appeal has been docketed at the Board within the time during which the Veteran is entitled to select a different docket option (either the Evidence Submission docket or the Hearing docket). See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 310 (2024). To ensure that the Veteran is afforded his full rights of appeal, in January 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking whether he would like the Board to wait the full modification period before issuing a decision, or whether the Veteran wished to waive that remaining time to allow the Board to issue a decision immediately. The Veteran responded that he waives the right to select a different docket on appeal and requesting the Board to move forward with a decision. See January 2025 Correspondence.

This appeal has been advanced on the docket. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases (including sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus as organic diseases of the nervous system) will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Regarding service connection claims for hearing loss, the Board notes that this particular disability is defined by regulation. Specifically, under the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the above frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Additionally, the Board observes that precedential case law provides that the threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels and that higher thresholds show some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The absence of in-service evidence of hearing loss is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as noted above) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss. Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159. Moreover, to establish service connection for sensorineural hearing loss, a veteran is not obligated to show that his hearing loss was present during active service. However, if there is insufficient evidence to establish that a claimed chronic disability was present during service or during the one-year presumptive period thereafter, the evidence must establish a nexus between his current disability and his in-service exposure to loud noise. Godfrey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 352 (1992).

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss. See December 2024 VA Form 10182. For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is not warranted.

In the December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made multiple favorable findings. First, the AOJ found that the Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. Second, the AOJ conceded military noise exposure based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS). As such, the first two elements of service connection (a current disability and an in-service disease or injury) are fulfilled. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c); Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.

Thus, the question becomes whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current disability of bilateral hearing loss and the in-service injury.

Turning to the relevant evidence, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints of, or treatment for, impaired hearing. His entrance examination noted normal ears and eardrums, and an audiogram reflected the following pure tone thresholds, in decibels:

March 1968		HERTZ

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	0	0	0	/	5

LEFT	0	0	0	/	0

At his separation examination, the Veteran denied current or past hearing loss. See April 1970 Report of Medical History. The separation examination noted normal ears and eardrums, and an audiogram reflected the following pure tone thresholds, in decibels:

April 1970		HERTZ

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	5	5	5	/	5

LEFT	5	5	5	/	5

Thus, a hearing loss disability for VA purposes was not shown in either ear while the Veteran was in service.

Post-service VA treatment records show that in February 2020, the Veteran first reported that he has difficulty hearing. See February 2020 Orthopedic Surgery Consult. Later, he reported having "difficulty hearing for many years." See December 2020 Audiological Assessment. A December 2020 audiological assessment noted current bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Id.

The Veteran first underwent a VA examination for hearing loss and tinnitus in September 2024. His Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

September 2024		HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	60	65	90	90	105	87.5	44%

LEFT	60	65	80	90	105+	85	44%

The VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was caused by or a result of military service. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's normal hearing at separation, without threshold shifts between his separation and enlistment examinations, was objective evidence that his in-service hazardous noise exposure did not cause permanent auditory damage. The examiner personally examined the Veteran, reviewed his claim file, and provided a well-reasoned opinion that is consistent with the other evidence of record. The Board therefore affords this opinion significant probative weight. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (a medical opinion's factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion contributes to its probative value).

Viewing the evidence as a whole, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that there is a nexus between the Veteran's current disability of bilateral hearing loss and an in-service injury. The Veteran's separation audiogram showed normal hearing, and he denied hearing problems at separation. A probative VA medical opinion indicated that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely than not due to in-service noise exposure. There are no positive nexus opinions of record. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his current hearing loss is the result of his conceded noise exposure. However, he has not been shown to have the requisite medical knowledge and experience to provide a competent nexus opinion for hearing loss. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge and training. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, especially the September 2024 VA medical opinion.

The Board further notes that the Veteran's representative has argued on appeal that the September 2024 VA medical opinion is not persuasive. See January 2025 Appellate Brief. This argument was based on an article regarding cochlear damage, which was cited in the appellate brief but was not submitted before the December 2024 AOJ decision on appeal and therefore cannot be considered by the Board. If the Veteran would like VA to consider this evidence, he is invited to file a supplemental claim. There is no other evidence to suggest that the September 2024 VA medical opinion is not persuasive or that the VA examiner was not qualified. As discussed above, the Board has found that this opinion is probative.

The Board has also considered whether service connection is warranted on a presumptive basis for chronic diseases. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015) (sensorineural hearing loss is considered a chronic disease for the purposes of § 3.309(a)). However, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year of separation from service. Instead, the Veteran was first diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in December 2020, approximately fifty years after separation from service. Therefore, presumptive service connection is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

The Board has additionally considered whether service connection is warranted based on a theory of continuous symptomatology. During VA medical treatment, the Veteran asserted that he has experienced "difficulty hearing for many years." See December 2020 Audiological Assessment. However, given the fifty-year time span between this report and his separation from active duty, it is unclear from the face of this statement whether the subjective hearing difficulties began within one year of separation from service or at some point thereafter. Moreover, this lay statement is outweighed by the Veteran's STRs which did not show a significant worsening of hearing acuity during service, and by his contemporaneous report at separation in which he denied current or past hearing trouble. The provided rationale by the VA examiner in this case, further, was not solely based on "normal" audiological findings at separation from service, but instead, noted the Veteran had largely normal hearing throughout service. Compare Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 164 (1993) (acknowledging VA's specific definition of a hearing disability, but nonetheless noting that hearing acuity limited to 20 decibels at certain frequency levels may still be indicative of some amount of hearing loss and, therefore, an examiner may not dismiss such in-service findings by concluding hearing was "normal" during service and, instead, must consider such levels and any change therein during service).

Thus, the evidence weighs persuasively against a hearing loss disability being noted during service or during the presumptive period. Service connection is not warranted based on a continuity of symptomatology framework. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus. See December 2024 VA Form 10182. For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is warranted.

For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). If a veteran reports ringing in his or her ears, then a diagnosis of tinnitus is generally applied without further examination. In addition, since the diagnosis of tinnitus is so heavily reliant upon lay statements, the etiology of the disorder is similarly reliant upon them. The date that a veteran reports that the tinnitus symptoms began is generally accepted as the date that the disorder began, without further examination. Thus, while service connection for tinnitus requires a medical diagnosis of tinnitus and a medical nexus relating the diagnosis to military service, lay testimony plays an unusually important role in these determinations.

The Veteran has a current tinnitus disability. See September 2024 VA Examination. In the December 2024 rating decision, the AOJ conceded military noise exposure based on the Veteran's MOS. Therefore, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's tinnitus had an onset in service or is related to service.

Turning to the relevant evidence, VA treatment records show that the Veteran first reported tinnitus in June 2018. See June 2018 Primary Care Physician Note. Later, he clarified that he has experienced left ear tinnitus intermittently ever since his first time riding an aircraft while in service. See December 2020 Audiology Diagnostic Study Note.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for hearing loss and tinnitus in September 2024. He reported that his tinnitus began in 1968, after a flight to Alaska, and has worsened since then. The Veteran's military personnel records reflect that he spent time in Alaska during active duty. See, e.g., June 1970 DD Form 214.

The September 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of his military noise exposure. The examiner reasoned that tinnitus is often the first sign of acoustic trauma, and the Veteran's normal hearing at separation without in-service threshold shifts was objective evidence that his in-service hazardous noise exposure did not cause permanent auditory damage.

The Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during service or within a year of separation from service. The Veteran has repeatedly reported that his tinnitus began during service, after a flight to Alaska, and continued to the present. The Board finds that his lay statements are competent and credible, and that they show continuity of symptomatology. The Board notes the negative September 2024 VA opinion. This opinion, however, did not adequately consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the in-service onset of his tinnitus. As such, the most probative evidence of record regarding a connection to military service is the Veteran's lay statements.

Accordingly, viewing the evidence as a whole, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.
