CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for service connection for diabetes have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310.

2.  The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1975 to July 1984 and from December 1984 to September 1997. 

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The December 2023 rating decision was issued in response to the Veteran's December 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, requesting a review of denial of entitlement to service connection for diabetes and erectile dysfunction in a May 2023 rating decision. In the May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that new and relevant evidence had been received to warrant readjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in January 2024. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that the AOJ was permitted to consider at the time it issued the December 2023 rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.301.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for diabetes and erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. See March 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application. For the reasons that follow, after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection is warranted. 

Under the general laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Certain chronic diseases, which are listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including diabetes, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

As an alternative method of establishing incurrence or aggravation and a nexus to service is through a showing of continuity of symptomatology since service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate that (1) a condition was noted during service; (2) there is a post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. The theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving diseases explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of diabetes and erectile dysfunction, and that the evidence shows his participation in a toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board acknowledges that in the body of the rating decision, the AOJ noted that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of diabetes. However, a March 2021 private opinion and evaluation shows a diagnosis of diabetes based on the Veteran's A1C levels exceeding 7 percent. Accordingly, as no clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record, the Board is bound by the favorable findings. Id. Thus, the current disability and in-service incurrence elements of the claim have been met. The Board also notes that the Veteran is service connected for obstructive sleep apnea. 

As to the nexus element, the Veteran underwent multiple VA examinations in connection with his claims. Medical opinions were obtained in May 2021, July 2022, August 2022, April 2023, and May 2023. The May 2021 VA examiner rendered a negative secondary service connection opinion with respect to erectile dysfunction based on the fact that erectile dysfunction and obstructive sleep apnea are unrelated conditions, and the medical literature fails to demonstrate a causal relationship between the two. The July 2022 VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion with respect to diabetes, noting that there is no objective evidence that the Veteran has condition that was incurred in or cause by his military service. As to entitlement to service connection for diabetes and erectile dysfunction on secondary basis, the July 2022 VA examiner noted these conditions are unrelated to obstructive sleep apnea and the medical literature fails to demonstrate a causal relationship among them. In the August 2022 VA addendum opinion, the examiner restated that there is no objective evidence to confirm that the Veteran's diabetes and erectile dysfunction are proximately due to or the result of obstructive sleep apnea. The April 2023 VA examiner rendered another negative secondary opinion regarding erectile dysfunction and diabetes. The examiner again noted that these conditions are not related to obstructive sleep apnea and a review of medical literature fails to demonstrate a causal relationship among them. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's medical records show that his erectile dysfunction is due to his hypertension and medication used to treat hypertension. In May 2023, the AOJ obtained VA opinions with respect to the Veteran's participation in a TERA. The examiner rendered negative nexus opinions as to diabetes and erectile dysfunction, noting that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between these conditions and the TERA. 

The Board notes that while the May 2021, July 2022, August 2022, April 2023, and May 2023 VA examiners offered clear conclusions, the findings do not appear to be supported by data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). Significantly, the above VA opinions are largely conclusory and not supported by a well-reasoned explanation of the Veteran's specific circumstances or specific citation to the relevant treatment records. Further, the Board notes that the July 2022, August 2022, and April 2023 VA examiners did not address aggravation. A medical opinion addressing secondary service connection must address causation and aggravation. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). Thus, the Board finds the May 2021, July 2022, August 2022, April 2023, and May 2023 VA medical opinions inadequate for purposes of adjudication and affords them no probative value.

March 2021 private opinions from Dr. T.J.G. are also of record. Dr. T.J.G. opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's diabetes and erectile dysfunction are due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. As to diabetes, Dr. T.J.G. noted that little or poor sleep due to sleep apnea causes changes in hormones, including insulin, cortisol, and ghrelin. Dr. T.J.G. noted that these changes in hormones make it harder to keep blood sugar and weight under control, which leads to diabetes. As to erectile dysfunction, Dr. T.J.G. noted that the Veteran started experiencing symptoms years after his onset of obstructive sleep apnea. Dr. T.J.G. pointed out that studies show that patients with obstructive sleep apnea develop erectile dysfunction due to low oxygen during sleep, chronic exhaustion, and testosterone instability. Dr. T.J.G. also noted that the Veteran has not responded to medical management of his condition. 

The Board assigns the March 2021 private opinions probative value, when considered along with the Veteran's lay statements as to the onset of aggravation of his diabetes and erectile dysfunction symptoms. Dr. T.J.G. expressed that the Veteran's diabetes and erectile dysfunction symptoms are likely due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea he has had for years. The March 2021 private opinions are also consistent with other evidence of record, to include medical research articles submitted by the Veteran, that suggest association between obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes and erectile dysfunction. See March 2023 Correspondence. 

The Veteran also submitted a prior Board decision that granted entitlement to service connection for diabetes as secondary to obstructive sleep apnea. Although prior decisions in other appeals may be considered in a case, to the extent that they reasonably relate to the case, prior Board decisions are not precedential or binding. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303. Thus, the prior Board decision has no probative weight in this current appeal, as it was based on a different evidentiary record.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's January 2008 VA examination notes that his erectile dysfunction symptoms started after he began taking his antihypertensive medications and the April 2023 VA examiner opined that his erectile dysfunction is due to his hypertension and medication used to treat hypertension. However, the Board notes that these findings do not address aggravation of erectile dysfunction by the service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. The Board points out that any incremental increase in disability or any additional impairment of earning capacity constitutes aggravation for purposes of service connection on the basis of aggravation of a non-service-connected disability. See Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233, 239 (2019). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's diabetes and erectile dysfunction had their onset in service or are related to service. The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any diagnosis or treatment related to diabetes and erectile dysfunction. Although the Veteran has a current diagnosis of diabetes, the condition was not shown in service, did not manifest to a compensable degree within a year after service, and is not in any way attributable to service. In addition, the Veteran does not assert that his claimed diabetes and erectile dysfunction are directly a result of his active service, to include his participation in a TERA. Instead, the Veteran asserts that these conditions are secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. Accordingly, service connection on a direct basis is not warranted. 

Nonetheless, after resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that his diabetes and erectile dysfunction are related to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. As noted, Dr. T.J.G. opined that the Veteran's diabetes and erectile dysfunction are secondary to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. Thus, service connection for diabetes and erectile dysfunction on a secondary basis is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
