ORDER

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability is denied.

REMANDED

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left ear hearing loss disability is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has had a right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes throughout the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served active duty in the United States Navy from April 1979 to April 1982.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), wherein the AOJ denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability.

In October 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the decision to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) and requesting a "Direct Review" of the evidence by a Veterans Law Judge. In an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review appeal, the Board considers the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted an additional lay statement and a statement from his wife in October 2024. However, as these statements were submitted after the evidentiary window had closed, the Board will not consider them in this decision. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability

The Veteran asserts that he has bilateral hearing loss disability that had its onset during service. In a September 2023 statement, the Veteran stated that he served as an Operations Specialist. He said that he was exposed to frequent varying levels of ear noise trauma, including jets, helicopters, flight line noises, galley noises, needle guns, and loud headset noises. The Veteran said that it was not always possible to wear hearing protection routinely or correctly due to never being provided hearing protection. The Veteran stated that upon his enrollment to active duty, he suffered from some hearing loss, which was made significantly worse during his active duty time. 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.

Additionally, where a veteran served 90 days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss, which is an organic disease of the nervous system, become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the award of service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability. The reasons follow.

As to evidence of a current disability, the November 2023 VA examination report showed that the Veteran's hearing in his right ear did not reach the threshold to have a hearing loss disability for VA purposes. Specifically, the Veteran's hearing loss in his right ear was not measured at 40 decibels or greater at any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz). Additionally, only one of the Veteran's right ear auditory thresholds had at least at 26 decibels or greater; and the speech recognition score using the Maryland CNC Test was 100 percent in the right ear. These facts persuasively show that the Veteran does not have a right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes either based on auditory thresholds or speech discrimination. Therefore, the first element of a service-connection claim is not met for the claim for service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability. 

The Board has considered lay statements from the Veteran that he has current right ear hearing loss; however, lay assertions do not constitute a competent evidence of a hearing loss disability for VA purposes. Competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1). While the Veteran is competent to report that he feels he has some hearing loss, his statements cannot constitute competent evidence in support of a current right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes. In the absence of a current diagnosis for a right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes, service connection cannot be established.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to service connection for a right ear hearing loss disability is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left ear hearing loss disability

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In this case, the Veteran's April 1979 examination for entrance into service indicated that the pure tone threshold at 3000 Hertz was 40 decibels in the left ear. Therefore, he had a left ear hearing loss disability noted at entrance into service, and the presumption of soundness is not for application. The issue then becomes whether the pre-existing left ear hearing loss disability was aggravated by service. See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 23 (2016) (the contemporaneous recording of an auditory examination threshold that meets the definition of hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 constitutes a notation of a hearing defect even without a contemporaneous medical examination interpreting the significance of those results). 

The Veteran was afforded a VA audiological examination in November 2023 and was diagnosed as having left ear hearing loss disability as defined by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The audiologist who conducted the examination provided an opinion that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss, which existed prior to service, was less likely than not related to the Veteran's service. The examiner did not address whether the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was aggravated beyond the natural progression during service. As this was a pre-decisional duty to assist error, a remand is necessary to obtain an adequate medical opinion as to whether the Veteran's pre-existing left ear hearing loss was aggravated by service. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Refer the claims file to a medical professional in order to provide a medical opinion in relation to the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left hearing loss disability. The examiner should be provided access to the complete claims file.

The agency of original jurisdiction must provide the below facts to the examiner.

To assist in a review of the claims file, the examiner is informed of the following facts with citations in the record, when applicable:

"	The Veteran served on active duty from April 1979 to April 1982.

"	For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

"	In the April 1979 Report of Medical Examination, the Veteran was found to be clinically normal in the ears - generally. However, the audiogram showed that the Veteran's left ear hearing had a puretone threshold of 40 decibels at 3000 Hertz (item 71). See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, pp. 14-15.

"	This means that the Veteran had a left ear hearing loss disability at service entrance. VA is seeking to determine if the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability was aggravated beyond its natural progression during service. 

"	In the April 1979 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported a positive history that he had or does have ear, nose, or throat trouble (item 11). The Veteran noted that he had a left ear problem four or five years ago (item 25). See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, pp. 17-18.

"	In May 1979, the Veteran complained of an earache. See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, p. 38.

"	In September 1979, the Veteran complained of an ear block. See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, p. 37.

"	In March 1981, the Veteran complained of decreased bilateral hearing for three days. The examiner noted that the Veteran had bilateral otitis media and left tympanic membrane perforation. See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, p. 35.

"	A March 15, 1982 Report of Medical Examination, the examiner noted that the clinical evaluation of the Veteran's Ears - General was abnormal (item 22). The examiner wrote that the Veteran had chronic perforation of the left ear tympanic membrane and he had left otitis externa. A hearing test was performed at that time (item 71). See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#1" in the Subject field, pp. 11-12.

"	A March 30, 1982 Report of Medical Examination, the examiner noted that the clinical evaluation of the Veteran's Ears - General was normal (item 22). A hearing test was performed at that time (item 71). See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#2" in the Subject field, pp. 10-11.

"	In the March 30, 1982 Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported a positive that he had or ever had ear, nose, or throat trouble, but denied that he had or ever had hearing loss (item 11). See VBMS entry with Document Type, "STR - Medical," Receipt Date 09/14/2023, with "#2" in the Subject field, pp. 12-13.

"	In a September 2023 statement, the Veteran stated that he served as an Operations Specialist. He said that he was exposed to frequent varying levels of ear noise trauma, including jets, helicopters, flight line noises, galley noises, needle guns, and loud headset noises. The Veteran said that it was not always possible to wear hearing protection routinely or correctly due to never being provided hearing protection. The Veteran stated that upon his enrollment to active duty, he suffered from some hearing loss, which was made significantly worse during his active duty time. See VBMS entry with Document Type, "VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim," Receipt Date 09/29/2023, with "Vet Statement _ Hearing Loss" in the Subject field.

"	The examiner's review of the record is NOT restricted to the evidence listed above. This list is provided to assist the examiner in locating potentially relevant evidence.

After reviewing the evidence, the examiner is asked to answer the following questions based upon the evidence of record and sound medical principles:

Was the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability, which pre-existed his entry into service, aggravated during his active duty military service, which service occurred from April 1979 to April 1982? Aggravation is an increase in severity that is not due to the natural progress of the disability. Please state upon what facts, medical principles, and/or medical literature support the opinion.

If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she should explain why this is so. The examiner shall then explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for more information and indicate what additional evidence is necessary, or whether he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question(s).
