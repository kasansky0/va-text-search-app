DOCKET NO. 220329-231840
DATE: April 14, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual employability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1973 to October 1976.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the specific procedural history will be discussed in greater detail below.

Of note, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system (known by the Board as AMA).  38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  

On her March 2022 VA Form 10182 to the Board, the Veteran selected direct review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Generally speaking, under the modernized review system, the Board may only remand an issue to correct any pre-decisional duty to assist errors it identifies.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  That same regulation also provides that the Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if such correction would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  Id. 

In this instance, a review of the procedural history is required.  Specifically, there are two distinct appeal streams which merit review.

Appeal Stream 1

The first stems from a July 2018 rating decision which awarded service connection for colitis, bilateral upper extremity radiculopathies, and a residual scar, and decreased the rating assigned for the Veteran's back disability.  Notably, TDIU was not addressed in this rating decision.  

Nonetheless, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement later in July 2018, which included the issue of TDIU as an area of disagreement.  In the resulting November 2019 Statement of the Case (SOC), the Veteran was informed as follows:

On your VA Form 21-0958, Notice of Disagreement, you listed the issue of entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU).  This is not a timely notice of disagreement and therefore is not addressed in this Statement of the Case.  The issue of TDIU was last addressed and denied by the Board of Veterans' Appeals in their decision dated July 11, 2017. You had 120 days to appeal this decision to the Court of Veterans' Appeals. There is no evidence of a timely appeal, therefore, this decision has become final.

In January 2020, the Veteran properly opted in to the AMA system via VA Form 10182.  See 38 C.F.R. § 19.2.  This form did not include the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.

However, the Board issued a decision in September 2023 which found that entitlement to a TDIU had been raised by the Veteran during the appeal period, and took jurisdiction over the matter under Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  The issue was remanded at that time, with instructions to obtain additional evidence.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998).

Following the requested development, a September 2024 rating decision was issued which denied entitlement to a TDIU in the first instance.  The Veteran did not appeal this rating decision via VA Form 10182, such that this appeal stream-existing under docket number 200102-63023-has extinguished.  Thus, there remains no existing TDIU claim under this appeal stream.

Appeal Stream 2

The second appeal stream stems from a January 2020 claim for a TDIU, submitted via VA Form 21-8940.

In February 2021, the Veteran was informed as follows:

We are unable to process your request for further review as your previously sent in application for individual unemployability was submitted on the incorrect form. This means that application is considered incomplete.  We have included the correct form (VA Form 21-526ez) below to assist you in filing your claim.

At a minimum, the Board notes that this letter was incorrect in informing the Veteran that a valid TDIU claim could not be submitted via VA Form 21-8940, which expressly exists to initiate a TDIU claim.  There is neither law nor policy which negates the validity of this form or its capacity to initiate a TDIU claim.

In April 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review.  Therein, she identified the February 2021 letter as that requiring review.  

In June 2021, the Veteran was informed as follows:

Unfortunately, we cannot accept your request for a higher-level review as the time limit to file this application has passed. VA must receive a request for a higher-level review no later than one year following notification of the contested decision.

Once again, the Board notes that this letter was clearly sent in error, as the April 2021 request for Higher-Level Review was submitted within one year of the February 2021 letter.

In February 2022, a rating decision was issued which denied a higher rating for the Veteran's service-connected scar.  Of note, this decision did not address the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU.  Nonetheless, she attempted to appeal the absence of this claim from the identified rating decision via March 2022 VA Form 10182.

In October 2023, the Veteran was sent a letter which stated that:

We completed your request for higher-level review, and discovered an error in assisting you to gather evidence to support your claim.  We will correct our error and forward your claim for further processing. We will then inform you of our new decision.

No subsequent rating decision or determination letter has since been issued.

Upon the above, the Board offers several conclusions.  First, there is no outstanding TDIU claim affiliated with the February 2022 rating decision.  The identified rating decision dealt solely with the evaluation assigned for the Veteran's service-connected scar, to which she has never attributed any degree of occupational impairment.  Thus, no affiliated TDIU claim can reasonably be associated with the increased rating issue, such that any attempt to appeal TDIU from the February 2022 rating decision fails.  

More broadly, there is no valid TDIU appeal before the Board at this time.  The January 2020 claim has not yet been adjudicated in the first instance; there is no valid TDIU claim associated with the February 2022 rating decision and which can be appealed; and the April 2021 request for Higher-Level Review is awaiting a definitive adjudication.

However, VA clearly erred in informing the Veteran that her January 2020 TDIU claim was invalid.  Thus, to avoid additional confusion as to this matter and to ensure that due process is ensured, a remand is instructed at this time for the RO to adjudicate the January 2020 claim for a TDIU.  Only if the Veteran appeals a negative determination will this matter be returned to the Board.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the Veteran's claim for a TDIU in the first instance, stemming from a January 2020 claim.  

This issue will only be returned to the Board if it is timely perfected.
