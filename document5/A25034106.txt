ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

Service connection for a right shoulder condition is granted.

An initial compensable rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease ("GERD") is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence of record is at least in relative equipoise that the Veteran exhibited symptoms of sleep apnea during service, and the resulting symptoms have persisted since exiting from service. 

2. The probative evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran incurred a right shoulder injury during service, and the resulting symptoms have persisted since exiting from service. 

3. The probative evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran's GERD resulted in two or more of the symptoms listed in the 30 percent criteria under Diagnostic Code 7346.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for?service?connection?for obstructive sleep apnea are met.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.?  

2. The criteria for?service?connection?for a right shoulder condition are met.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.?  

3. The criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for service-connected GERD were not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2018 to May 2019 and from March 2021 to July 2021. This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).??? 

In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), seeking?direct?review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Under?Direct?Review, all evidence available at the time of the decision on appeal is considered.??? 

Furthermore, while the Board acknowledges the Veteran's intention to disagree with the January 2020 rating decision that denied service connection for PTSD, the April 2024 VA Form 10182 falls outside of the one-year deadline. Hence, the Board cannot adjudicate the issue. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.

1. Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

Legal Criteria 

To prevail on the issue of?service?connection?there must be evidence of a current disability, in-service?incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during?service. See Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 116667 (Fed. Cir. 2004).?Service?connection?may also be established under?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(b) for a current disability on the basis of a presumption under the law that certain chronic diseases manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after?service?must have had their onset in?service; and?service?connection?may be established by evidence of continuity of symptomatology.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a).? 

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. In other words, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). 

Factual Background

The Veteran was diagnosed with respiratory sleep apnea at a December 2019 VA examination. 

At the VA examination, the Veteran reported that before his deployment, he was sleeping in the barracks with other men, and there were complaints about his snoring. The Veteran further stated that his girlfriend complained about his snoring. 

The conducting examiner indicated that the Veteran underwent a sleep study in December 2019, which suggests that he was not diagnosed with sleep apnea. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not require the usage of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, or a breathing assistance device and that continuous medication was not required for control of a sleep disorder. 

Analysis

The Board notes that the December 2019 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of sleep apnea but also indicated that they had a diagnosis of respiratory sleep apnea in the general medical report. Given this contradictory information and viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the record supports a finding that he has a diagnosis of sleep apnea.

The Board also finds the Veteran competent and credible to report that his fellow servicemembers complained about him snoring during service. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Additionally, the Board finds the Veteran competent and credible to report that his girlfriend complains that he snores at night. 

Given the above, and the lack of a negative nexus opinion, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record is at least in relative equipoise that the Veteran exhibited symptoms of sleep apnea during service, and the resulting symptoms have persisted since exiting from service.

Resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is granted. 

2. Service connection for a right shoulder condition is granted.

Factual Background

The Veteran attended an August 2022 private medical treatment, during which he was diagnosed with impingement syndrome of the right shoulder. 

The Veteran reported that his right shoulder pain began during service in April 2021 after lifting construction cones into a truck. See August 2022 medical treatment. 

The Veteran underwent a right shoulder scope in December 2022. 

The Veteran reported right shoulder pain consistently between December 2022 and March 2023. See medical treatment records.

Analysis

The record supports a finding that the Veteran has a diagnosis of a right shoulder condition. Accordingly, the first element of service connection has been met.

The Board assigns probative value to the Veteran's statements that he injured his right shoulder during service after lifting equipment. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent and credible to report observable symptoms. See Jandreau supra. 

Additionally, the Board notes that the record indicates that the Veteran's right shoulder pain persisted after exiting from service. 

Considering the above, the proximity between the end of the Veteran's service and the diagnosis of his right shoulder condition, as well as the lack of a negative nexus opinion, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran incurred a right shoulder injury during service, and the resulting symptoms have persisted since exiting from service. 

Resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a right shoulder condition is granted. 

3. An initial compensable rating for GERD is denied. 

Legal Criteria 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The Rating Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. Part 4. GERD is not specifically listed in the rating schedule; therefore, it is rated analogous to a disability in which not only the functions affected, but anatomical localization and symptoms, are closely related, which in this case is "Hernia, hiatal."

The criteria for evaluating diagnostic code (DC) 7346 for "Hernia, hiatal" (or GERD) shows as follows:

A 10 percent rating is assigned "With two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity." 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

A 30 percent rating is assigned if there is "Persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health."

A 60 percent rating is assigned if there are "Symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health."

The rating code applicable to GERD does not define the terms "considerable" or "severe." However, the term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012).

Effective May 19, 2024, revisions were made to 38 C.F.R. § 4.112 and 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, impacting the diagnostic code for digestive disorders. This includes the addition of Diagnostic Code 7206 which specifically addresses GERD. However, these changes are inapplicable to the appeal, as the appeal addresses a period prior to May 19, 2024.

Factual Background

The Veteran was afforded a January 2024 VA examination for his GERD, during which the conducting examiner indicated that he had symptoms of infrequent episodes of epigastric distress, pyrosis, and reflux. 

The examiner did not find evidence of regurgitation, substernal, arm or shoulder pain, or symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. The examiner further indicated that the Veteran does not have an esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus, or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. 

Analysis

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable rating for his GERD. In order to meet the criteria for a 10 percent rating, the Veteran would have to display two or more of the following symptoms: persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

The probative evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran's GERD produces pyrosis. However, the record does not support a finding that the Veteran's GERD results in persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, regurgitation, substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. 

Additionally, the Veteran has not provided any statements indicating that he experiences regurgitation, substernal, arm or shoulder pain, or symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.

Accordingly, an initial compensable percent rating for the Veteran's GERD is denied.
