ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's GERD is characterized by symptoms which include pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain; and is not characterized by persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R.       §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321(a), 4.1, 4.20, 4.3, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1984 through March 1988 in the United States Army. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement: VA Form 10182 and selected the Direct Review docket. Based on that docket selection, the Board is limited in its review of the evidence and may only consider the evidence of record at the time the October 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the October 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R.         §§ 20.300, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim: VA Form 20-0995 and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.? 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. 38 U.S.C.? § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.? 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.? 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is denied.

Legal Criteria

When a condition is unlisted, it is permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. 

GERD is rated by analogy to diagnostic code (DC) 7346 for hiatal hernia. Under DC 7346 a 10 percent rating is warranted for a disability with two or more of the symptoms listed for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A 60 percent rating is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R.§ 4.114, DC 7346. 

The Board notes that on May 19, 2024, 38 C.F.R. § 4.114 was updated. Diagnostic Code 7206 was added to address disability ratings for GERD. However, since the October 2023 rating decision on appeal arose before the rating schedule changed, the Board will be applying the old criteria rather than the new criteria.

Factual Background

In a March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran reported several symptoms of GERD. These include heartburn, acid reflux, regurgitation, coughing, nighttime choking due to regurgitation, sore throat, chest pains, sleep disturbances, and dark colored stool. The Veteran noted that he frequently uses over the counter medications to control the symptoms of his GERD and avoids certain foods. The Veteran also reported having to refrain from eating late in the day, laying down soon after eating, and eating large meals. 

In an April 2023 VA examination, the examiner found that the Veteran experienced pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, and frequent sleep disturbances. At that time, the examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms were not productive of considerable or severe impairment to his health. The examiner noted that the Veteran takes over the counter medications to control the symptoms. Additionally, the examiner found that the Veteran did not experience epigastric distress, dysphagia, material weight loss, vomiting, nausea, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia, or suffer from esophageal strictures.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion regarding his GERD. The private clinician noted that the Veteran experiences pyrosis, regurgitation, and substernal, arm, or shoulder pain. The clinician also noted that the Veteran takes over the counter medications to treat his GERD symptoms.

Analysis

At the time of the rating decision on appeal, GERD did not have its own rating criteria in the VA ratings schedule for the digestive system. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. Thus, the Veteran's GERD is rated under DC 7346 by analogy. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. 

A review of the Veteran's medical records shows that he suffers from several symptoms of GERD. However, in order to warrant a 30 percent rating, the Veteran must have evidence of persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, or symptoms that are productive of considerable impairment to his health. At this time, the Board has found no evidence of, and the Veteran has not alleged, that he experiences recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia. Further, the April 2023 VA examiner did not find that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of considerable impairment to health.

In order to warrant a 60 percent rating, the Veteran must have evidence of pain, vomiting, material weight loss, hematemesis, and melena with moderate anemia, or symptoms which are productive of severe impairment to his health. At this time, the Board notes the Veteran's reports of pain, however, there is no evidence of the any other required symptomatology associated with a 60 percent rating. Further, the April 2023 VA examiner did not find that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of severe impairment to health.

After a thorough review of the records, the Board finds that the currently assigned 10 percent rating is the appropriate rating for the Veteran's condition. Accordingly, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against assigning an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD.
