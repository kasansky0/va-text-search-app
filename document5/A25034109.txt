ORDER

The Veteran's appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

There is no eligible rating decision issued in the year prior to the receipt of the June 2024 VA Form 10182 that adjudicated a claim for hearing loss.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the Veteran's appeal regarding entitlement to service connection for hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this appeal, served on active duty from October 1983 to October 1991.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that denied the Veteran service connection for his OSA on the basis that medical literature does not support poly paint exposure causing OSA.  

In June 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision.? In?a July 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of July 17, 2023.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.301.? If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it herein.? 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.? 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for OSA, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.?  38?C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).??? 

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is dismissed.  

The July 17, 2023, rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's OSA on the basis that the medical literature did not support poly paint exposure causing OSA; no additional claims were adjudicated in that rating decision.

On June 5, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 and noted disagreement with the AOJ's denial of service connection for OSA and hearing loss and identified rating decisions issued in April 2023 and July 2023.  However, a claim for hearing loss was not adjudicated in the April 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  In fact, no rating decision in the year prior to the June 2024 VA Form 10182 has adjudicated a claim for hearing loss.

While 38 C.F.R. 20.202 (a) requires a liberal construction of the Veteran's Notice of Disagreement, such is not needed here as the June 2024 VA Form 10182 is clear that the matter of disagreement concerned service connection for OSA and hearing loss.  As the issues the Veteran wanted to appeal are clearly identified in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (f) is not for application.

The AOJ has not adjudicated a claim related to hearing loss since May 1992, so the Board is unable to find that the issue is ripe for appeal at this time.  Therefore, there is no question of fact or law remaining for the Board to consider.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Accordingly, the Board may not consider an appeal related to hearing loss, and the Veteran's appeal for service connection for hearing loss must be dismissed.

Because the AOJ accepted the Veteran's claim for hearing loss and began developing the claim, the AOJ accepted jurisdiction over the hearing loss claim, and it is currently pending before the AOJ.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for his OSA and contends that he never had snoring or sleeping problems until he entered service.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Under the AMA, the Board may only?remand?an issue for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.? See?38 C.F.R. § 20.802?(a).?? 

A July 2023 rating decision denied the Veteran service connection for OSA but also reflects the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA. Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

 The Board has identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

The Board remands the claim for service connection for OSA to obtain an adequate medical opinion.? See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38?C.F.R. §§ 3.159 (c)(4),?20.802.? When the VA undertakes to provide an examination or obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.? See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 311-12 (2007).? 

Based on a finding that the Veteran had participated in toxic exposure risk activities (TERA), the Veteran was afforded a VA TERA examination in July 2023.  See April 2023 TERA Memorandum.  The July 2023 VA examiner opined that "[t]he most common cause of OSA in adults is obesity, male sex, and advancing age. Medical literature does not support obstructive sleep apnea resulting from poly paint exposure."  The examiner found that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's OSA was caused by the poly paint exposure related to his duties as an Aviation Electrician.  This opinion is inadequate because it is based solely on a lack of medical literature analyzing the effects of exposure to poly paint and whether such exposure can lead to OSA, did not discuss how the most common causes of OSA applied to the Veteran and failed to discuss any facts pertaining to the Veteran's condition or individual circumstances.  See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60-61 (2018) (holding that a medical opinion was inadequate as a matter of law because the rationale was based solely on general articles and did not discuss any facts pertaining to the Veteran's condition or individual circumstances).  The Board rejects this opinion.

Failing to obtain an adequate opinion and relying on an inadequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, requiring remand for appropriate corrective action.? 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); Barr, supra.        

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and addendum opinion from an appropriately qualified VA clinician as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's currently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.  The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the clinician.?  

After a complete review of the claims file, the clinician is asked to respond to the following:?	 

		TERA Consideration

	Provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's currently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea disability is related to his conceded toxic exposures during service, including his exposure to poly paint.? 

In forming the requested opinion, the clinician MUST consider:?   

"	The Veteran's lay statements that he never had issues with snoring or sleeping problems until he entered service.  See January 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

"	The Veteran's exposure to poly paint in a hot environment and in a confined space, requiring him to wear a respirator.  See November 13, 1989, STR.  

"	The Veteran's exposure to chromates and nuisance dust on September 22, 1989.  See September 22, 1989, STR.  

"	Total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and,

"	Synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities. 

A full and thorough rationale must be provided for all opinions, referencing relevant medical and lay evidence where appropriate.??
