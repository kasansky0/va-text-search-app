ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, it is at least as likely as not that his tinnitus is related to his active duty military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1988 to October 1991.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus most recently addressed in an October 2020 rating decision.  In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes the Veteran's attempt to appeal the AOJ's proposal to sever service connection for bladder cancer in the February 2024 rating decision.  However, the AOJ had not yet issued a final decision implementing the proposal and the February 2024 proposal to sever service connection was not a final decision.  Therefore, the February 2024 proposal to sever service connection is not subject to appeal. Subsequent to the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ finalized the severance of service connection for bladder cancer in a May 2024 rating decision.  However, the Veteran did not indicate appeal of the May 2024 rating decision in his July 2024 VA Form 10182. While the Veteran's appeal to the Board is timely to the May 2024 rating decision, the Veteran's VA Form 10182 indicates he was appealing the February 2024 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board finds the February 2024 rating decision is on appeal.  See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  Consequently, the proposal to sever service connection is not on appeal before the Board.  The Board notes the Veteran still has time to file an appeal of the May 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran has one year from the date of notification of the May 2024 rating decision to appeal to the Board and may also request an extension of time, if needed based on good cause.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. 

The Board notes the Veteran, in his July 2024 VA Form 10182, indicated disagreement with the decision to grant service connection for bladder cancer awarded in an August 2023 rating decision that also assigned a 100 percent disability rating.  However, as service connection was granted, the Veteran was awarded the full benefit sought.  As such, there is no question or controversy for this issue.  Additionally, service connection was severed in a May 2024 rating decision which bars receipt of an increased rating for this disability as a matter of law.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1) ("additional benefit will not be awarded after basic entitlement has been terminated, such as by severance of service connection").  Consequently, there is no appealable issue before the Board related to service connection for bladder cancer.

Finally, the Board notes the Veteran attempted to appeal rating decisions issued in August 2012, October 2020, July 2021, and August 2022.  The utilization of a VA Form 10182 for a rating decision issued prior to February 19, 2019 would be improper for the filing of a legacy Notice of Disagreement and the appeal was not timely submitted.  Additionally, the Veteran did not provide good cause for doing so and did not request an extension.  Moreover, the Veteran did not timely appeal the October 2020, July 2021, and August 2022 rating decisions within one year of notification of those decisions or request an extension of time to file an appeal.  Consequently, the Board finds that the issues listed in the August 2012, October 2020, July 2021, and August 2022 rating decisions are not on appeal before the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus.  See October 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  

Service connection may be granted if there is a disability resulting from personal injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  To establish service connection, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Tinnitus is readily observable by laypersons, and medical expertise is not required to establish its existence.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  In November 2020, the Veteran reported that he had tinnitus.  See November 2020 VA treatment records.  In September 2023, a VA audiologist assessed the Veteran with bilateral tinnitus.  See September 2023 VA treatment records.  The Veteran's assertions that he currently has tinnitus constitutes competent evidence of a current disability of tinnitus.  Therefore, the first Shedden element of service connection for tinnitus has been established.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167. 

Regarding the second element of service connection, an in-service event, injury, or illness, the AOJ conceded the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise due to his military occupation specialty as an infantryman.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Therefore, the second Shedden element of service connection for tinnitus has been established.  Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.

Regarding the third element of service connection, the Board notes the Veteran was afforded the opportunity to attend VA examinations in October 2020 and December 2023.  The Veteran did not attend either VA examinations.  However, a VA physician noted the Veteran has chronic tinnitus and reports hearing loss occurred with shooting in the Gulf.  See November 2020 VA treatment records.  In September 2023, the Veteran reported intermittent bilateral tinnitus for several years.  See September 2023 VA treatment records.  The VA audiologists note the Veteran has chronic tinnitus for more than 6 months and noted the Veteran has a history of military noise exposure.  Id.     

The Veteran is competent to provide lay evidence of the existence of symptoms that are capable of lay observation and may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Additionally, in appropriate situations, the Veteran can report symptoms to establish the link between an in-service incurrence and subsequent diagnosis of a disability.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).  As noted, the AOJ conceded the Veteran's hazardous noise exposure due to his MOS.  The Veteran indicated his tinnitus was due to shooting in the Gulf during service, indicating it began in service, and he has had intermittent chronic tinnitus for years.  There is no evidence to the contrary.  As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding the continuity of his tinnitus are competent and credible.  Moreover, as noted, tinnitus is the type of disability lay witnesses are competent to identify.  See Charles, 16 Vet. App. at 374. 

In sum, there is competent, credible lay evidence of continuity of tinnitus symptoms since service.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Therefore, in consideration of all the evidence in this case, and with resolution of any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's tinnitus is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).
