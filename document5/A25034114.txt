ORDER

The appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided by Guilfoyle Ambulance Service, Inc., on December 15, 2019, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of medical care provided to the Veteran on December 15, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on December 15, 2019, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical care services to the Veteran.??? 

In February 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the evidence submission docket to review a July 2020 notice letter issued by a VA AOJ that denied payment for a December 15, 2019, episode of care for medical services provided by Guilfoyle Ambulance Service, Inc.

The Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on December 15, 2019, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.?In a July 2021 Report of Contact, the AOJ advised the Appellant that the December 15, 2019, episode of care was approved upon administrative review. The evidence indicates that the amount paid is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care. If the amount paid for the December 15, 2019, episode of care is disagreeable, the Appellant may request review of the July 2021 decision.

Thus, the administrative action for the entire December 15, 2019, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and represents a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.?Therefore, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed.?38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
