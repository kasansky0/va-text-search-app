REMANDED

The claim to reopen the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral (back) strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease status post compression fracture L-1 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1966 until his honorable discharge in October 1969.

The rating decision on appeal was issued on November 2, 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the November 30, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The December 2023 Docketing Letter erroneously noted that the NOD was submitted on October 30, 2023. The evidence of the record reflects that the NOD was submitted on November 30, 2023. The Board presumes that the date on the Docketing Letter was a typo. A Board decision was then issued in January 2024 dismissing the issue of entitlement to reopen the claim for service connection for back strain given that the Veteran failed to submit the NOD within the one year requirement and that the NOD was thus untimely. 

The Veteran appealed the January 2024 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In January 2025, the Court granted a January 2025 joint motion for remand (JMR), thereby vacating the January 2024 Board decision and remanding the appeal back to the Board. 

The January 2025 JMR indicates that the Board erred by failing to provide the Veteran with adequate notice and an opportunity to respond to a potential jurisdictional defect, consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c) (2020). The JMR further indicated that remand was warranted for the Board to ensure compliance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c) and provide the Veteran with a period of 60 days to submit evidence, argument, or request a hearing, consistent with that regulation, after which the Board would determine whether it has jurisdiction over the issues on appeal, as required by 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c). 

Thus, a remand is warranted to ensure that the Veteran is provided adequate notice and an opportunity to respond to the jurisdictional defect consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran notice regarding the jurisdictional defect, specifically that the submission of his November 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD was untimely. 

2. Provide the Veteran a period of 60 days to submit evidence, argument, or request a hearing, consistent with the regulations.
