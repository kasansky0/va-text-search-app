REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1, 2008 to July 25, 2013. He received a discharge under other than honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the direct review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (November 4, 2024). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. 

The Board notes that a March 2024 Board remand determined that the character of the Veteran's discharge from service was a threshold issue in the Veteran's appeal of the issues of service connection for PTSD and bilateral knee disorders. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an administrative decision regarding the character of the Veteran's service in September 2024, which the Veteran did not list on the 2024 VA Form 10182. While the October 2024 decision on appeal did not adjudicate the issue of the Veteran's character of service, such a determination remains a necessary and included part of his service connection claims. See D'Amico v. West, 209 F.3d 1322, 1326 (2000). 

In July 2024, the Veteran, with the assistance of counsel, knowingly and voluntarily waived VA's duty to assist. The Veteran, through counsel, also requested that the Board render a decision based on the evidence of record. Thus, the Board will proceed with adjudication.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

The Veteran contends that he had two periods of service, the first of which was honorable, and that he is therefore entitled to recognition as a veteran and eligible for VA benefits. 

A discharge or release from active service under conditions other than dishonorable is a prerequisite to entitlement to VA pension or compensation benefits. 38?U.S.C. §?101(18); 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(a). The designation of a discharge as honorable by a service department is binding on VA as to the character of discharge. Id. VA has no authority to alter the discharge classification, and the claimant's recourse is with the service department. 38?C.F.R. §?3.203(a); Spencer v. West, 13. Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000); Venturella v. Gober, 11?Vet. App.?240, 241 (1997); Cahall v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?232, 237 (1994); Duro v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?530, 532 (1992).

There are two types of bars to establishing entitlement to VA benefits: (1) statutory bars and (2) regulatory bars. 38 U.S.C. § 5303(a); 38?C.F.R. § 3.12(c), (d).

A statutory bar precludes the payment of VA benefits when a former service member was discharged or released under one of the following conditions: (1) as a conscientious objector who refused to perform military duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of competent military authorities; (2) by reason of the sentence of a general court-martial; (3) resignation by an officer for the good of the service; (4) as a deserter; (5) as an alien during a period of hostilities, where it is affirmatively shown that the former service member requested his or her release; and (6) by reason of a discharge under other than honorable conditions issued as a result of an AWOL for a continuous period of at least 180 days, with certain exceptions. 38 U.S.C. § 5303(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c).

Regulatory bars are discharges or releases due to one of the following offenses: (1) acceptance of a discharge under other than honorable conditions or its equivalent in lieu of trial by general court-martial; (2) mutiny or spying; (3) offenses involving moral turpitude, which includes, generally, conviction of a felony; and (4) willful and persistent misconduct.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.13(a), a discharge to reenlist is a conditional discharge. Per 38 C.F.R. § 3.13(b), the entire period of service for such a conditional discharge "constitutes one period of service and entitlement will be determined by the character of the final termination of such period of active service." 

However, 38 C.F.R. § 3.13(c) provides an exception if the following conditions are met: (1) the person served in the active military, naval, air or space service for the period of time the person was obligated to serve at the time of entry into service; (2) the person was not discharged or released from such service at the time of completing that period of obligation due to an intervening enlistment or reenlistment; and (3) the person would have been eligible for a discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable at that time except for the intervening enlistment or reenlistment. 

Thus, although the general rule provides that continuous reenlistments prior to expiration of the entire period of any given enlistment is generally to be considered as a single lengthy enlistment, an exception is provided when a person actually completes an entire period required by an enlistment, and there is no evidence of misconduct or other basis for the award of a discharge under conditions other than honorable during that enlistment period. In such cases, VA benefits may be granted based on the period of initial obligation.

Turning to the record, on October 1, 2008, the Veteran enlisted in the United States Army for a period of three years and 18 weeks with an expected discharge date of February 4, 2012. An October 2009 DA Form 4833 - Commander's Report of Disciplinary or Administrative Action notes that the Veteran was cited for fleeing the scene of a traffic accident after he collided with a guard rail. Six points were assessed against the Veteran's United States Army Europe driver's license. The Veteran was honorably discharged on December 12, 2010, for immediate reenlistment. The character of separation for this period is indicated as being "honorable." He reenlisted on December 13, 2010, for a period of two years, with an expected discharge date of December 12, 2012. 

On July 31, 2011, the Veteran was detained by the German police and subsequently charged with violations of Article 128 (assault consummated by battery), Article 134 (drunk and disorderly conduct), and Article 92 (failure to obey an order and regulation) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). On October 2011 memorandum notes that the Veteran was disapproved for a Good Conduct Medal for the period of September 28, 2009 to September 28, 2011. The states that he had "at least one instance of bad conduct that has resulted in an Article 15 action. Soldier's new eligibility period begins on 28 September 2011." On March 20, 2012, the Veteran was found not guilty of the July 2011 charges. 

A March 2013 DA Form 4833 documents a charge of wrongful use of a dangerous drug. The date of the offense is listed as March 23, 2012. The Veteran was found guilty at a field grade non-judicial action (Article 15). He was sentenced to 45 days restriction, 45 days extra duty, and the forfeiture of a portion of his pay. 

An April 2013 DA Form 4833 documents charges of wrongful possession and distribution of marijuana, failure to obey an order or regulation, bribery, possession of an herbal substance containing cannabinoids, and wrongful possession of marijuana. The listed dates of these offenses are December 6, 2012, December 11, 2012, and December 20, 2012. The form also notes that a settlement resulted in a plea agreement and pre-trial diversion. 

The Veteran was discharged on July 25, 2013, under other than honorable conditions. 

Based on the evidence of record, and the laws governing discharges under 38 C.F.R. § 3.13, the Board finds the Appellant had service for the period of time he was obligated to serve at the time of entry into service (October 1, 2008 through February 4, 2012); he was not discharged or released from such service at the time of completing that period of obligation due to an intervening enlistment or reenlistment; and he would have been eligible for a discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable at that time except for the intervening enlistment or reenlistment on December 13, 2010. In light of the March 2012 finding that the Appellant was not guilty of the July 2011 charges, the Board is unable to conclude that the Appellant engaged in misconduct prior to February 4, 2012. As the Appellant's misconduct leading to his other than honorable discharge began after the date his initial service obligation terminated, the criteria for an exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.13(c) are met. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Appellant's period of service from July 1, 2008 to February 4, 2012, is honorable and not a bar to VA compensation benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 3.13(c).  The Veteran's period of service from February 4, 2012 to July 25, 2013 will be addressed in the remand section of this decision. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran's period of service from February 4, 2012 to July 25, 2013 constitutes a second period of service, characterized by his final discharge under other than honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court martial. Thus, the Board must determine if he is entitled to VA benefits, exclusive of health care and related benefits authorized under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, for this period of service. 

Given the misconduct detailed herein, the Board finds that the regulatory bar to benefits found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(2)(ii), based on willful and persistent misconduct, is applicable to the Veteran's second period of service. Therefore, the Board must consider whether there were compelling circumstances which would mitigate the misconduct at issue or if the Veteran was insane, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.360. 

A recent amendment to the regulation governing character of discharge expanded the compelling circumstances exception. See Update and Clarify Regulatory Bars to Benefits Based on Character of Discharge, 89 Fed. Reg. 32,361 (April 26, 2024) (codified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.12). Specifically, the factors considered in determining the reasons for the prolonged AWOL have been expanded, and now include the length and character of service exclusive of the misconduct, whether a valid legal defense would have precluded a conviction for the misconduct unde the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and the reasons for the misconduct, including an appellant's mental or cognitive impairment at the time of the in-service misconduct, whether there was duress, coercion, or desperation, and his age, cultural background, educational level, and judgmental maturity. 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(e).

If?the appellant is shown to have been "insane" under VA regulations at the time of the offense leading to his discharge, the bar to payment of benefits imposed by the nature of the Appellant's discharge will be lifted.?38 U.S.C. § 5303(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.12(b).

Under VA regulations, an insane person is one who, while not mentally defective or constitutionally psychopathic, except when a psychosis has been engrafted upon such basic condition, exhibits, due to disease, a more or less prolonged deviation from his normal method of behavior; or who interferes with the peace of society; or who has so departed (become antisocial) from the accepted standards of the community to which by birth and education he belongs as to lack the adaptability to make further adjustment to the social customs of the community in which he resides. 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the insanity need only exist at the time of the commission of the offense leading to the person's discharge, and that there is no requirement of a causal connection between the insanity and the misconduct. Struck v. Brown, 9?Vet. App.?145 (1996). There still must be competent evidence, though, establishing the appellant was insane at the time of the offenses in question leading to the other than honorable discharge. Zang v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?246, 254 (1995). In addition, the Court held that "a determination of whether a person is insane is, in effect, a determination of whether the person's actions were intentional, and, thus, the result of willful misconduct." Id. at 254. The Court further indicated such a determination is not warranted when the record does not reflect that a veteran suffered from insanity due to disease or that he or she did not know or understand the nature or consequences of his or her acts, or that what he or she was doing was wrong. Id. Significantly, the burden is on the appellant to submit competent medical evidence that the servicemember was insane at the time of the offenses. Stringham v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?445, 449 (1995).? Furthermore, mental illness is not identical to "insanity." Beck v. West, 13?Vet. App.?535, 539 (2000). 

?

In May 1997, VA General Counsel discussed the intended parameters of the types of behavior, which were defined as insanity under 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a). It was indicated that behavior involving a minor episode or episodes of disorderly conduct or eccentricity does not fall within the definition of insanity in that regulation. It was further indicated that a determination of the extent to which an individual's behavior must deviate from his or her normal method of behavior could be best resolved by adjudicative personnel on a case-by-case basis in light of the authorities defining the scope of the term insanity. VAOPGCPREC 20-97 (May 22, 1997).?

Following a review of the record, particularly the Appellant's the diagnosis of PTSD, his combat experience, and his statements that he used illegal drugs to medicate his PTSD symptoms the Board finds that a remand is necessary to obtain a medical opinion regarding the Appellant's mental state at the time of his misconduct. This remand is required to cure pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

The Board further finds that remand is appropriate to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that has a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claims for VA compensation for PTSD and bilateral knee disorders. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Board is unable to render a fully informed decision on these issues until after the AOJ implements the grant of veteran status and determines whether the Veteran's disabilities were incurred during his period of honorable service. This remand is required to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that has a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Veteran's claim for a TDIU. See Id.

The issue of entitlement to compensation for PTSD and bilateral knee disorders is also inextricably intertwined with the issue of whether the Veteran's period of service from February 4, 2012 to July 25, 2013 is a bar to entitlement to VA benefits. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two or more issues are inextricably intertwined if one claim could have significant impact on the other). Therefore, this claim must also be remanded.

?

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Implement the grant of veteran status. 

2. Schedule the Appellant for a VA psychiatric examination to assess the Appellant's mental state leading to his discharge from service. The examiner should review the entire claims file, including a copy of this remand. 

The examiner should be advised that 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a) defines "insanity" as "one who, while not mentally defective or constitutionally psychopathic, except when a psychosis has been engrafted upon such basic condition, exhibits, due to disease, a more or less prolonged deviation from his normal method of behavior; or who interferes with the peace of society; or who has so departed (become antisocial) from the accepted standards of the community to which by birth and education he belongs as to lack the adaptability to make further adjustment to the social customs of the community in which he resides." The term "insanity" refers to a condition involving conduct which deviates severely from the social norm or interferes grossly with the capacity to meet the ordinary demands of life. See VAOPGCPREC 20-97. 

The examiner should also be informed that VA's General Counsel has held that behavior which is generally attributable to a particular substance-abuse disorder does not exemplify the severe deviation from the social norm or gross nature of conduct which is generally considered to fall within the scope of the term insanity, and therefore, does not constitute insane behavior under 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a). 

The examiner should be informed that disorders that are not subject to service connection may be considered in determining the issue of insanity. 

After a review of the claims file the examiner must answer the following:

(a.) Does the evidence, either lay or medical, indicate the Appellant exhibited mental or cognitive impairment at the time of the in-service misconduct? If so, to what extent? Please explain why or why not.

(b.) Discuss the Appellant's mental state during service, to include consideration of his age, cultural background, educational level, and judgmental maturity at the time of the offenses that resulted in his other than honorable discharge.

(c.) At the time of the offenses underlying his other than honorable discharge, did the Appellant exhibit a more or less prolonged deviation from his normal method of behavior?

(d.) At the time of the offenses underlying his other than honorable discharge, did the Appellant, due to disease interfere with the peace of society?

(e.) At the time of the offenses underlying his other than honorable discharge, was the Appellant, due to disease, so departed (become antisocial) from the accepted standards of the community to which by birth and education he belongs as to lack the adaptability to make further adjustment to the social customs of the community in which he resides?

(f.) Was the Appellant otherwise insane at the time of the offenses underlying his other than honorable discharge?

For the purposes of the opinion, the examiner should assume the Appellant's statements about his symptoms are credible, unless they are inconsistent with the medical evidence or with medical principles concerning her condition. The Board emphasizes that this does not constitute a positive credibility determination, as VA will weigh the evidence upon adjudication.

In providing the requested opinions, the examiner may identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or contradictions contained in the evidence of record, and may state whether the Appellant's lay statements are supported by medical or other evidence. The examiner may not dismiss the Appellant's statements about his symptoms solely because they are not documented in contemporaneous treatment records. 

3. After the above development is completed, adjudicate whether the Veteran's period of service from February 5, 2012 to July 25, 2013 is dishonorable and a bar to VA benefits

?

4. Then, adjudicate the issues of entitlement to VA compensation for the Veteran's PTSD and bilateral knee disorders.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
