ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. 

2. The Veteran does not have tinnitus.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 4.87.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1969 to January 1972. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Service connection for bilateral hearing loss 

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability related to his military service, including in-service noise exposure from firearms, aircraft noise, and explosions that he was exposed to during his service in Vietnam.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and has not at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The November 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of hearing loss, such as needing to ask others to repeat themselves, but that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of hearing loss for VA purposes. 

On the authorized audiological evaluation during the Veteran's November 2023 VA examination, puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15 	 15	20 	25 	35 

LEFT	15 	 20	 20	25 	35 

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 100 percent in the right ear and of 96 percent in the left ear.

For VA purposes, a minimum degree of hearing loss is a prerequisite for entitlement to service connection. McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15 (2016). A hearing loss diagnosis for VA purposes requires puretone thresholds of 40 or greater at any one of the above frequencies, or 26 or greater at three or more frequencies in either ear, or less than 94 percent speech recognitions in either ear. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels and higher thresholds show some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993).

The November 2023 VA examination tested the Veteran's pruetone thresholds in decibels, and included the Maryland CNC speech discrimination test. These objective measurements comply with the VA audiological testing standards and are therefore given full probative weight.

While the Veteran reports experiencing symptoms of hearing loss, such as asking others to repeat themselves, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education to perform the audiological testing and interpret the results. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The Veteran does not have hearing loss that meets the criteria established by VA to qualify as a disability. Despite the Veteran's reported symptoms and in-service noise exposure, he does not have hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes. Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

2. Service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends he experienced in-service noise exposure, including from firearms, aircraft noise, and explosions during his service in Vietnam. On documents submitted to the VA with his July 2023 claim for service connection, the Veteran stated he experiences "ringing in ears tinnitus," related to in-service noise exposure due to "constant noise gun fires, etc" and that it began in approximately 1974, after his active service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of tinnitus and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The November 2023 VA examiner conducted an in-person examination of the Veteran and reviewed his e-folder. The examiner had an opportunity to consider the Veteran's statements and his in-service noise exposure. The examiner determined the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of tinnitus. In the remarks portion of the examination report, the examiner made the following notation: "Veteran reports intermittent ringing that he stated occurs 2-3 times per day and is present for 1-2 seconds per episode. Veteran's description of symptoms does not meet the Dauman and Tyler (1992) definition of tinnitus cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler) Veteran reports transient ear noise that occurs in the general population without auditory damage or pathology."

The examiner also went on to draw a distinction between the Veteran's reported symptoms of intermittent ear ringing and diagnosable recurrent tinnitus, which consists of episodes longer in duration than the Veteran's reported 1-2 seconds per episode, often lasting at least five minutes, or being constant or near-constant. The examiner concludes the Veteran's symptoms are more consistent with transient ear noise, which is distinguishable from noise-induced tinnitus. The examiner concludes by stating "Veteran denies recurrent tinnitus."

The Veteran has claimed service connection for tinnitus and has made lay statements describing ringing in his ears since 1974. The Veteran is competent to report subjective symptoms like ringing in his ears, because it is a symptom capable of lay observation. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

However, in weighing the conflicting evidence, the Board may determine what evidence to award more probative weight. In making this determination, the Board can consider such factors as medical expertise and credibility. This includes considering the Veteran's interest in receiving VA benefits. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995). In consideration of all facts before it and weighing the relative probative value of the evidence, the Board gives more probative weight to the opinion of the VA examiner, who determined the Veteran's reported ringing in his ears does not support a diagnosis of tinnitus.  The Board points out that the examiner has more education, training and experience in diagnosing medical disorders such as tinnitus, and made direct reference in support of his opinion to the standard in the medical community for a tinnitus diagnosis.  While the Veteran may be sincere in believing he has tinnitus, he clearly does not have the same level of expertise in diagnosing that disorder, and his self-diagnosis is based on his own observations without reference to any definition of the disorder.  The Board finds the examiner's opinion is more probative on the question of whether the Veteran actually does have tinnitus.

The Veteran therefore does not meet the primary threshold for service connection for tinnitus because he does not have a diagnosed disability.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a grant of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the claims, that doctrine is not applicable, and service connection must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
