ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus began during active service and has persisted since service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1969 to May 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The September 2024 rating action from which this appeal originates determined that new and relevant evidence to readjudicate the claim had been submitted.  The Board is bound by this determination.

The Board lastly notes that the Veteran has until the expiration of the one year period following the September 2024 rating action on appeal to request a different appeal lane.  However, given that the Board is granting the appeal in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication of the appeal at this time.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he has experienced tinnitus ever since he was exposed to M107 175mm cannon fire while serving in Vietnam. The Veteran states that the incident caused ringing in his ears which he still experiences to this day.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service and is related to his in-service noise exposure. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

July 2024 and August 2024 VA examination records confirm the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus. The Veteran described the onset of his tinnitus in a lay statement provided to VA in June 2024. The Veteran described a specific onset of his tinnitus during his service in Vietnam in 1970 or 1971 when he was exposed to acoustic trauma from rocket fire. Thus, the remaining question before the Board is whether the current disability is related to service. 

The July 2024 and August 2024 VA examiners both opine that the Veteran's tinnitus is not service connected. However, the August 2024 VA examiner's opinion considers only whether the Veteran's TERA exposure is etiologically related to his tinnitus. The July 2024 examiner provides a negative nexus opinion, raising the rationale that the Veteran's service treatment records do not contain a complaint of tinnitus. However, this alone is not dispositive when weighed against the Veteran's statements that he did experience the onset of his tinnitus in service.

Based on a review of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that there is probative evidence with regard to a nexus on the basis of continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). The Veteran has a diagnosis of bilateral tinnitus, he is competent to report that he has experienced symptoms of bilateral tinnitus since service, and the Board finds the Veteran's report of those symptoms to be credible.

In his statements to VA examiners and in his June 2024 lay statement provided to VA for consideration with this claim, the Veteran describes the onset of his tinnitus being related to a specific incident of cannon fire he was exposed to while serving in Vietnam. The Veteran's deployment to Vietnam is supported by evidence in his service records. It is unsurprising that the Veteran would not seek treatment for acoustic trauma while stationed in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971.

?

Because the Veteran credibly describes the onset of his tinnitus while in service, and the disability has persisted since the Veteran's active service. In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise (evidence for an against the claim is essentially equal). Therefore, the criteria for entitlement to service connection have been met, and service connection for tinnitus is granted.
