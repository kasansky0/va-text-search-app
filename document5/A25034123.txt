CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a back condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a neck condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107;38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1971 to December 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023 decision.  In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As noted, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a Notice of Disagreement to change the Board docket being requested.  The time limit for such modification is within one year from the date the notification of the decision on appeal is sent or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  The Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Here, as the claim is granted, the Board finds that proceeding is not prejudicial to the Veteran.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, establishing service connection requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  Additionally, a showing of continuity of symptoms from separation to the present is a factor to be considered in assessing service connection claims.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a back condition.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a neck condition.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a back condition diagnosed as lumbosacral strain and degenerative arthritis and a neck condition diagnosed as cervical strain and degenerative arthritis, contending a fall from an aircraft while in service caused his disabilities.

As an initial matter, the Board recognizes the following favorable findings regarding this claim:  The Veteran was diagnosed with lumbosacral strain, degenerative arthritis of the back, cervical strain, and degenerative arthritis of the neck.  Furthermore, a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, specifically he hit his head on an aircraft in service.  The Board will not disturb these favorable findings.  As such, the first two elements of service connection have been established.

Regarding the final element, here, the evidence establishes a nexus between active duty and his back and neck conditions.  The Veteran submitted a July 2022 private opinion from his treating physician who opined his back and neck conditions were more likely than not caused by his in-service accident.

The Board finds the private opinion adequate and afforded it high probative value as the physician supported the conclusion based on treatment of his back and neck conditions, familiarity with his medical history, including complaints of back and neck pain since military service, expertise in the practice area, diagnostic imaging, and the clinical presentation of his conditions.

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board acknowledges a negative July 2022 VA opinion.  However, the Board finds the July 2022 opinion inadequate and affords it limited probative value as the examiner relied primarily on the absence of clinical evidence and appears to have disregarded any lay statements that did not have supporting clinical evidence.

The Board finds the weight of the evidence supports the Veteran's back and neck conditions are etiologically related to service.  Therefore, the Board finds service connection is warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
