CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309 (e).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309 (e).

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309 (e).

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309 (e).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Marine Corps from May 1967 to May 1971, including service in the Republic of Vietnam from July 1969 to January 1970.

In the February 12, 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on January 7, 2025.

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2020 decision. In January 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2020 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, is granted.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, is granted.

4. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, presumptively related to herbicide exposure, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he developed peripheral neuropathy symptoms in his right and left upper extremities and in his right and left lower extremities, as a result of exposure to herbicides, and that these symptoms manifested proximate to his discharge from service, possibly prior to his separation. See January 2025 Board Hearing Transcript.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases, including peripheral neuropathy (an organic disease of the nervous system) may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). Such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time.

Early-onset peripheral neuropathy is a disease entitled to presumptive service connection based on exposure to herbicide agents. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). Early-onset peripheral neuropathy must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after the last date on which the veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service. 3.307 (a)(6)(ii).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Incidentally, the Board observes that the Veteran is service-connected for Parkinson's disease, with right and left upper extremity and right and left lower extremity tremor, muscle rigidity/stiffness and bradykinesia or slowed motion, presumptively related to his herbicide exposure. See September 2024 Rating Decision Narrative. "The presence of PN [peripheral neuropathy] has been noticed in Parkinson's disease (PD)." Stanford Parkinson's Community Outreach, Neuropathy in Parkinson's Disease, STANFORD MEDICINE, available at https://med.stanford.edu/parkinsons/symptoms-PD/neuropathy.html (last updated Sept. 2021). Nevertheless, the Board emphasizes that the grants of service connection for right and left upper extremity and right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, as articulated herein, are presumptive grants related to herbicide exposure, as opposed to secondary grants related to Parkinson's disease.

The Veteran has current diagnoses for right and left upper extremity and right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and his herbicide exposure has been conceded. See January 2021 Rating Decision. Thus, the question becomes whether his disabilities had onset during an applicable presumptive period of time. 

The Veteran testified that he recalls experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (prickling, the burning sensation, sensitivity to touch) in his right and left upper extremities and right and left lower extremities during the "early part of 1972." See January 2025 Board Hearing Transcript. As will be discussed below, this statement is credible and supported by medical evidence. This is sufficient to grant his claim as a chronic disability under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(3), 3.309 (a). However, the Board finds a grant, presumptive to herbicide exposure, is more appropriate.

Turning to the medical evidence, an October 1983 medical treatment record references a twelve-year history of pain and numbness in the Veteran's neck, arm, hands, and feet. This supports an onset date of approximately some point in 1971. A November 1983 medical treatment record references dull pain in the bilateral upper and lower extremities, beginning in 1972. In a February 1988 lay statement, the Veteran reported: "After leaving service in 1971 and trying to adjust to a normal daily routine I was in constant pain with my arms, legs, neck and sometime[s] all over my body. I was unable to sleep. I went to several doctors but they were unable to make a concrete diagnosis. In 1978 I was referred to Dr. V[.] who is a specialist in arthritis and muscle disorders [...] I underwent extensive test[s]. The result[] was that I had muscular fibrositis and it was possibly caused by my military service."

Admittedly, despite significant medical evidence approximating an onset date, there is some doubt as to whether the Veteran's symptoms began in 1971 or 1972. Nevertheless, the precise onset date is impossible to establish, and the Board is giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt on this point (with the understanding that an onset date of 1972 already clears the threshold to establish service connection on a presumptive basis for chronic diseases), such that his disability will be presumptively associated with herbicide exposure going forward, and his claims for service connection for right and left upper extremity and right and left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are, therefore, granted, as a result.
