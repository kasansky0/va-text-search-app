ORDER

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion caused by painful motion due to a right knee bone contusion (right knee disability) is denied.

2. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period on appeal, flexion of the Veteran's right knee was not limited to 45 degrees or less.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating of 30 percent for IBS.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the entire period on appeal, the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's right knee disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5260.

2. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating of 30 percent for IBS. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 4.114, DC 7319.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2021 to April 2023.

This matter is before the Board on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision which granted service connection for IBS evaluated as 30 percent disabling, effective April 25, 2023, and service connection for a bone contusion of the right knee, evaluated as 10 percent disabling due to painful motion, effective April 25, 2023. 

The Veteran appealed the January 2024 rating decision by submitting an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and electing the direct docket. For an AMA claim on the direct review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the January 2024 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board considers the Veteran's evidentiary submissions after the January 2024 rating decision only to note that that the Veteran filed an April 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, for increased ratings for IBS and limitation of flexion due to a right knee bone contusion. The Veteran was afforded additional VA examinations for both claims in April 2024, and the AOJ ultimately confirmed and continued the Veteran's January 2024 ratings in an August 2024 rating decision. However, in the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran stated that he was appealing the claims of IBS and limitation of flexion due to a right knee bone contusion from the January 2024 rating decision. Consequently, the Board did not consider any evidence submitted after the January 2024 rating decision on appeal in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801; see Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Staged ratings are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function, will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee disability.

Legal Basis

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. It is essential that the examination upon which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and the functional loss, with respect to all these elements. The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervations, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. A little used part of the musculoskeletal system may be expected to show evidence of disuse, either through atrophy, the disability of the skin, absence of normal callosity or the like. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

Under DC 5258, a 20 percent rating is warranted for cartilage, semilunar dislocated, with frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion into the joint. The 20 percent rating is the only rating available under DC 5258.

DC 5259 provides that a 10 percent rating is warranted for surgically removed cartilage that is symptomatic. A semilunar cartilage is one of the menisci of the knee joint. A 10 percent rating is also the highest schedular evaluation allowed under DC 5259.

Under DC 5260, limitation of flexion of the knee to 60 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating. Limitation of flexion of the knee to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. Limitation of flexion of the knee to 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. Limitation of flexion of the knee to 15 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating.

Under DC 5261, limitation of extension of the knee to 5 degrees warrants a zero or noncompensable rating. Limitation of extension of the knee to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. Limitation of extension of the knee to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. Limitation of extension of the knee to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating. Limitation of extension to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating, and extension limited to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating.

DC 5262, pertaining to impairment of the tibia and fibula, malunion with slight knee or ankle disability warrants a 10 percent rating; malunion with moderate knee or ankle disability warrants a 20 percent rating; malunion with marked knee or ankle disability warrants a 30 percent rating; and nonunion of the tibia and fibula, with loose motion, requiring brace warrants a maximum 40 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Normal range of motion of the knee is from zero degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

The VA General Counsel has held that separate ratings can be provided for limitation of knee extension and flexion under DCs 5260 and 5261 as long as both ranges of motion meet the criteria for a compensable rating. VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59,990 (2004).

When determining the severity of musculoskeletal disabilities, VA must also consider the extent of any additional functional impairment above and beyond the limitation of motion objectively demonstrated due to the extent of pain/painful motion, limited or excess movement, weakness, incoordination, and premature/excess fatigability, etc., particularly during times when the symptoms "flare up," such as during prolonged use, and assuming these factors are not already contemplated in the governing rating criteria. See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. 202; Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). See also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59. The provisions regarding the avoidance of pyramiding do not forbid consideration of a higher rating based on greater limitation of motion due to pain on use, including flare ups. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, those provisions should only be considered in conjunction with the DCs predicated on limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.

A veteran may receive a compensable disability rating based on pain, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relates to painful motion. This regulation notes: "The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or maligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint." 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has explained that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 applies when evaluating joint pain, even if such pain is not arthritis related. Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 4 (2011).

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. Painful motion is an important factor of joint disability, which is entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. However, the evaluation of painful motion as limited motion only applies when the limitation of motion is noncompensable under the applicable DC. Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. 32.

The rule against pyramiding is addressed in 38 C.F.R. § 4.14, and notes that the evaluation of the same disability or the same manifestation under various diagnoses is to be avoided. See also 38 U.S.C. § 1155. It is possible for a Veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury that would permit rating under several diagnostic codes; however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 (precluding the assignment of separate ratings for the same manifestations of a disability under different diagnoses).

Factual Background

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a knee and lower leg VA examination. After an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's records, the Veteran was diagnosed with limitation of flexion of the right knee due to a bone contusion. Range of motion testing of the right knee was performed. The Veteran's initial range of motion measurements were abnormal with a flexion endpoint of 135 degrees and an extension endpoint of 5 degrees. Evidence of pain existed in flexion. Passive range of motion testing returned identical results. There was evidence of pain when weight-bearing, in active motion, and in passive motion. The Veteran reported that his right knee "gives out" while walking sometimes, and that he has "an aching pain in his knee all the time." There was no evidence of crepitus, and there was no evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the knee. Observed repetitive-use testing was performed returning identical results as initial range of motion testing returned. Although the Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time, procured evidence suggested that pain caused functional loss due to repeated use over time. The VA examiner estimated that after repeated use over time the Veteran's flexion endpoint would be 135 degrees and his extension endpoint would be 5 degrees. The Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, joint instability, tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscal conditions. The Veteran endorsed occasionally using a brace. January 2024 Knee Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

Analysis

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability picture for the Veteran's right knee limitation of flexion is most closely approximated by the criteria for a rating of 10 percent under DC 5260 due to painful motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. 

The record before the Board is devoid of evidence showing that the Veteran's right knee flexion was limited to 60 degrees during the period on appeal, let alone the limitation of flexion to at least 45 degrees required for a higher rating under DC 5260. As such, the Veteran is not entitled to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's right knee disability. 

In making this determination, the Board acknowledges its duty to maximize a claimant's benefits. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993). Additionally, the Board also notes that the Veteran is entitled to ratings under whichever Diagnostic Codes are more favorable. For the period on appeal, the Veteran also is service connected for limitation of extension of the right knee with a noncompensable rating. At no point during the period on appeal was the Veteran's right knee extension limited to 10 degrees or more, making an increase in his rating under DC 5261 inapplicable. Moreover, the Veteran already is being compensated for pain causing functional loss for this joint. He cannot be assigned separate ratings for painful motion under both DC 5260 and DC 5261 unless both movements (flexion and extension) reach a compensable degree; otherwise, doing so would result in impermissible pyramiding.

As to other possibly applicable diagnostic codes, there is no evidence of ankylosis of his right knee, vitiating the applicability of 5256. DC 5257 does not apply because there is no evidence of persistent instability of the right knee or of a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex. As for DC 5258, no evidence exists that the Veteran suffers from a meniscal disability, to include frequent episodes of "locking" or effusion in his right knee. Moreover, consideration of a rating under DC 5259 is not warranted because the Veteran had not undergone surgery of his right knee. As there also is no evidence that the Veteran suffered from tibial or fibular impairment, DC 5262 is inapplicable. DC 5263 cannot apply because there is no indication of genu recurvatum. Finally, a separate rating under DC 5003 is not warranted because there is no diagnosis of arthritis, and because doing so would contravene the letter of the law as, according to DC 5003 Note 1, a rating under DC 5003 "will not be combined with ratings based on limitation of motion." 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5003 Note 1. Nothing in the record suggests that the Veteran's left knee was affected.

The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches. Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993). Whether a physician provides a basis for a medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits. See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998). Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-49 (2000).

The January 2024 knee conditions VA examination report and its accompanying medical opinion were provided by a VA medical professional who possess the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested opinion, the examination report and medical opinion were shown to have been based on an in-person examination of the Veteran coupled with a review of the Veteran's claims file, and the VA examiner provided an adequate rationale for the provided opinion. See January 2024 Knee Conditions DBQ. Taking these factors into consideration, the Board places significant probative weight on the January 2024 Knee Conditions DBQ and its accompanying medical opinion because the VA medical professional directly interfaced with and examined the Veteran, reviewed the Veteran's treatment records, and provided adequate rationales for the conclusions contained within. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating under DC 5260, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

2. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for IBS is denied.

The Veteran seeks an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected IBS.

In January 2024, the Veteran was afforded an intestinal conditions VA examination. After an in-person examination and a review of the Veteran's records, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with IBS. The Veteran complained of experiencing diarrhea after receiving treatment in service in a hospital. The Veteran was noted to have occasional episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. The Veteran had no weight loss attributable to his IBS, nor did the Veteran have malnutrition, serious complications, or other general health effects attributable to his IBS. The Veteran endorsed functional impact, noting that his IBS causes him to take frequent breaks to use the restroom. January 2024 IBS DBQ.

Effective May 19, 2024, the rating criteria for the digestive system were revised. Under the pre-May 19, 2024, version of DC 7319, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate disability, with frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for severe disability, with diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7319 (pre-May 19, 2024).

The revised version of DC 7319, effective May 19, 2024, now pertains to irritable bowel syndrome. A 10 percent rating is assigned for abdominal pain related to defecation at least once during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension. A 20 percent rating is warranted for abdominal pain related to defecation for at least three days per month during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension. A maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension. Id.

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110. 

Under other circumstances, the Board would consider the Veteran's claim under the pre-May 19, 2024, rating criteria as the rating criteria was revised between the date of the relevant rating decision and the date that the Veteran filed his appeal and all of the applicable evidence pertaining to the Veteran's IBS symptoms are from before the change in the law. Here, however, the applicable rating criteria is immaterial. The Veteran's IBS currently is rated at 30 percent disabling, effective April 25, 2023, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7319. As this is the highest rating for IBS under both the pre- and post-May 19, 2024, rating criteria, and this rating is assigned for the entire period on appeal, an initial disability rating higher than 30 percent is not warranted. 

The Board now turns to whether referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted. In exceptional situations where the rating is inadequate, it may be appropriate to refer the case for extraschedular consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b); Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 114 (2008); aff'd, Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The governing norm in these exceptional cases is a finding that the disability at issue presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).

These criteria have been bifurcated into the following two elements: (1) the schedular criteria must be inadequate to describe the claimant's disability level and symptomatology; and (2) there must be related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 114 (2008); Anderson v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 423, 427 (2009). If both elements are met, the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service for a determination of whether the claimant's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating. Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b). Referral is not warranted if either element is not satisfied. Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 494-95 (2016).

As concerns the first element, comparison of the Veteran's symptoms and associated functional impairment does not show that the rating criteria are inadequate to describe the Veteran's disability picture. When a claimant's IBS results in diarrhea, stomach pain, and nausea, those effects are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017). In this case, the rating criteria for IBS contemplate the functional effects of diarrhea, stomach pain, and nausea that cause the Veteran occasionally to call out of work and to use the bathroom frequently. The threshold issue under Thun thus is not met, and further consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 30 percent for IBS, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
