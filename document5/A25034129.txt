ORDER

Service connection for bladder cancer, for accrued benefits purposes, is denied.

Service connection for bone cancer, for accrued benefits purposes, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection for several disabilities, including bladder and bone cancer, on February 16, 2022. 

2. The Veteran's eligibility for service-connected benefits terminated before payment for such benefits would have become due or payable. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to accrued benefits based on a pending claim for service-connected benefits have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1102, 1304, 1541, 5112, 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.31, 3.160, 3.500 (g), 3.1000.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1975 to September 1981. He died in February 2022. The Appellant is his surviving spouse. 

Prior to his death, the Veteran filed a claim seeking, in part, service connection for bladder cancer and bone cancer. He passed away the same month his claim was filed. 

In February 2023, the Appellant filed a claim seeking entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC). A statement received that month indicates that she was seeking "accrued benefits" for bladder cancer and bone cancer. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, as well as entitlement to death pension and accrued benefits.  

In April 2024, the Appellant filed a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, requesting review of the February 2024 rating decision. The issues being challenged included entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer and bone cancer. 

In June 2024, the AOJ issued a Higher-Level Review rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection these issues for accrued benefits purposes only. 

Thereafter, in the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant disagreed with the denial of service connection for bladder and bone cancer and elected the direct review docket.

Therefore, given the Appellant's election of the direct review docket, the Board will only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer, for accrued benefits purposes

2. Entitlement to service connection for bone cancer, for accrued purposes 

The Appellant is seeking entitlement to accrued benefits based on a claim for service connection for bladder and bone cancer filed by the Veteran in February 2022. She contends that the Veteran's bladder and bone cancers were caused by his exposure to ionizing radiation in the military. 

Upon the death of a Veteran, the Veteran's lawful surviving spouse may be paid periodic monetary benefits to which the Veteran was entitled at the time of death, and which were due and unpaid for a period not to exceed two years, based on existing rating decisions or other evidence that was on file when the Veteran died. 38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000.

An accrued benefits claim arises after a Veteran has died. Although a Veteran's claim does not survive his death, certain individuals may be entitled to accrued benefits under certain conditions. Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994). One of the requirements for accrued benefits is that a claim must be filed within the year after the Veteran's death. 38 U.S.C.A. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000.

The Appellant's Application for Dependency and Indemnity, Death Pension, and Accrued Benefits was received on February 18, 2023, within the year after the Veteran's death. As noted, in the February 2024 decision on appeal, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for cause of the Veteran's death, as well as entitlement to death pension and accrued benefits.

For a surviving spouse to be entitled to accrued benefits, "the Veteran must have had a claim pending at the time of his death for such benefits or else be entitled to them under an existing rating or decision." Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299-1300 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The term "pending claim" means an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c). In turn, the term "finally adjudicated claim" means an application, formal or informal, which has been allowed or disallowed by the agency of original jurisdiction, the action having become final by the expiration of one year after the date of notice of an award or disallowance, or by denial on appellate review, whichever is earlier. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d).

VA received the Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to service connection on February 16, 2022, just 11 days prior to the date of his death on February 27, 2022. The record does not show, and the Appellant does not contend, that a claim for service connection for bladder cancer or bone cancer, either formal or informal, was received prior to that date.

Because the Veteran's claim was filed many years after he was discharged from service in September 1981, as a general matter, the effective date of an award of service connection would be the date of receipt of the claim, as that is later than the date entitlement arose. See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(1)(ii). Payment of monetary benefits will commence the month following the effective date of the award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

In this case, the effective date of the Veteran's eligibility for service-connected benefits would have been February 16, 2022. 

In this regard, the mere existence of medical evidence of a disorder does not establish intent to seek service connection, or entitlement to an earlier effective date. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 3 (1998); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). Rather, a formal or informal claim must be filed in order for any type of benefit to accrue or be paid, and a claim for service connection must indicate intent to apply for that benefit. See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151(a), 3.155(a); Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998). While information contained in treatment records may constitute an informal claim, this is only appropriate in cases where service connection has already been established, or where a claim was previously denied due to the disability not rising to a compensable level. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Neither of those circumstances was present in the Veteran's case.

In other words, the effective date of service connection is not assigned based on the date the claimant asserts that the disability appeared, or on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating the existence of such disability and a causal connection to service. Rather, the effective date is assigned based on the date that the application or claim upon which service connection was eventually granted was received by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Lalonde, 12 Vet. App. at 382-83.

With regard to whether liberalizing law applies and the criteria for retroactive payment pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 are applicable, the Board notes the Veteran's exposure to ionizing radiation qualifies as a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) as defined in the PACT Act, which became effective on August 10, 2022, after the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim. Furthermore, the lay assertions submitted by the Veteran and Appellant, as well as his service records, indicate that his reported exposure to ionizing radiation was based upon his military occupational specialty (MOS) and not the PACT Act's expansion of locations subject to a presumption of exposure. Therefore, any grant of service connection would have been allowable by law prior to the enactment of the PACT Act. 

As such, the criteria for retroactive payment are not applicable in this case. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). Therefore, the proper effective date would have been February 16, 2022, the date on which the Veteran's initial claim was received. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

As such, the earliest point at which monetary benefits could have begun was March 1, 2022. However, the effective date of discontinuance of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension by reason of the death of the payee is the last day of the month before death occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 5112 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.500(g)(1). In this case, that would have been January 31, 2022. 

As such, any award of the Veteran of service-connected benefits would have terminated as of January 31, 2022, prior to March 1, 2022, the earliest date of the period for which payment could be made. Hence, at the time of the Veteran's death on February 16, 2022, no service-connected benefits were due or payable to the Veteran. As there existed no service-connected benefits due or payable to the Veteran at the time of his death, the Appellant is not entitled to accrued benefits based on any posthumous award of service-connected benefits as a result of a pending claim at the time of his death.

In cases such as this, where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied because of the absence of legal merit. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994). The Board sympathizes with the Appellant, but under the applicable law and regulations, the facts argued in this matter are not relevant. The law does not provide any relevant exception to in this case. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Appellant's favor and the appeal must be denied.
