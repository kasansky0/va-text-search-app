ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine did not begin during active service, nor is it otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1974 to June 1977.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine.

The Veteran contends that his current back disability is caused by an in-service back injury. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran has a diagnosis of lumbar spine degenerative arthritis. The Veteran's service records show he received medical treatment for a lumbar strain while in active service.

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, are subject to presumptive service connection if the symptoms manifest to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

To establish service connection under this provision, there must be evidence of a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under C.F.R. § 3.307) and subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology, however, can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, reasonable doubt will be resolved in each such issue in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An appellant need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence to prevail. To deny a claim on its merits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine, and evidence shows that the Veteran did experience a lumbar strain in service, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's present diagnosis of degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The record also does not show that the Veteran's arthritis had its onset in service, manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service, or had continuity of symptomatology since the Veteran's service.

VA treatment records show the Veteran was not diagnosed with degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine until November 2019, decades after separation from service. The Veteran's medical and service records show that the Veteran indicated that he was not experiencing back pain on his March 1977 service exit exam, and the Veteran denied back pain on a July 1989 re-enlistment exam for the Air National Guard. However, the Veteran has stated that he experienced symptoms of back pain since service. The Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that these symptoms were manifestations of degenerative arthritis. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the musculoskeletal system as well as diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Taken together, the VA opinions of record, including the October 2022 and March 2023 VA examiners' opinions, establish that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine is not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including the lumbar strain noted in the Veteran's service treatment records. The October 2022 VA examiner based his opinion on a review of the Veteran's records, which included service treatment records and private treatment records, as well as the Veteran's lay statements about the back injury he sustained in service and the back pain he experienced since service. The October 2022 examiner opined that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine was not at least as likely as not related to the lumbar strain in service. The examiner's rationale was that the Veteran's service records indicated an acute lumbar strain, which usually resolves over time. There was no indication from the Veteran's medical records that there were other back complaints, ongoing care, or continuity of care.

The March 2023 VA examiner also reviewed the Veteran's medical records, including service treatment records and private treatment records, as well as the Veteran's lay statements. The March 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine was not at least as likely as not related to his in-service lumbar strain. This examiner's rationale is that there is no continuity of symptomatology between the Veteran's in-service lumbar strain, and current arthritis diagnosis. The examiner notes there are no records to indicate treatment for back pain between the Veteran's separation from service in 1977 and 2022. The Veteran also indicated that he was not experiencing back pain on his March 1977 service exit exam, and denied back pain on a July 1989 re-enlistment exam for the Air National Guard. There is also not enough evidence to show the in-service injury (a lumbar strain) would cause the current condition (arthritis). The examiner concludes that there is no evidence that the Veteran's current disability was caused or aggravated by his military service, and therefore there is no nexus. The opinions of both the October 2022 and March 2023 examiners are probative, because each is based on the Veteran's medical history, and account for the Veteran's lay statements and self-reported back pain. Each provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). Therefore, the October 2022 and March 2023 VA examination opinions are given full probative weight by the Board.

The Veteran believes his current degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine disability is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. Specifically, the Veteran has provided lay statements describing back injuries in service and the back pain he has experienced since service. The Veteran provided written statements in October 2010 and July 2019, as well as testimony at a previous Board hearing in May 2022. The Veteran also provided a letter from a chiropractor confirming the Veteran was a patient approximately 30 years ago, even though those records have since been destroyed. The Veteran in this case is competent to report symptoms such as back pain, but is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the musculoskeletal system and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Even though the Veteran reports back pain after his in-service injury, he is not competent to diagnose that pain as arthritis, his current disability. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the opinions of the October 2022 and March 2023 VA examiners' negative nexus opinions.

Finally, the Board has considered the Veteran's claim as a chronic disease under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309. However, the weight of the evidence indicates the disease was not chronic in service, as his only relevant in-service diagnosis was for lumbar strain; the Veteran has not exhibited continuous symptomatology, as records show he indicated no back pain on his March 1977 service exit exam, and denied back pain on a July 1989 re-enlistment exam; and that the disease did not develop to a compensable degree within the presumptive period following separation from service, as the Veteran was not diagnosed with degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine until 2019. 

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the claims, that doctrine is not applicable, and service connection must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
