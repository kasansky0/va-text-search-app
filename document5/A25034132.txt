ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lung cancer is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for right hand condition, muscle deterioration, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was stationed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days during his active service and is therefore presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water supply therein.

2. Lung cancer did not manifest in service or for many years after service, and is not etiologically related to the Veteran's military service, to include exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.

3. Right hand condition did not manifest in service or for many years after service, and is not etiologically related to the Veteran's military service, to include exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for lung cancer, as due to exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309(f).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right-hand condition, as due to exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1111, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309(f).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1970 to January 1972 and January 1973 to January 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Because the April 2024 rating decision on appeal was issued after February 19, 2019, it is subject to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (a)(1); 19.2(a).

In June 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review the April 2024 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for lung cancer is denied.

The Veteran contends his lung cancer is due to drinking contaminated water at Camp Lejeune during service. See June 2021 Statement in Support of Claim.

The AOJ identified several favorable findings, including: (1) the Veteran served at Camp Lejeune, and, thus, contaminated water exposure is conceded; (2) the Veteran was diagnosed with lung cancer; (3) the claimed lung cancer is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service; and (4) the Veteran served for the more than 90 days to meet the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection. See April 2024 Rating Decision.

A Veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Generally, to establish service connection the evidence must show (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). When the evidence is in approximate balance, i.e., "nearly equal," a claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Further, lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time that those symptoms appeared. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

A veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, who had no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of service at Camp Lejeune during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to the contaminants in the water supply, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the individual was not exposed to contaminants in the water supply during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7). For the purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7), contaminants in the water supply means the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene, and vinyl chloride, that were in the on-base water-supply systems located at Camp Lejeune.

If a veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, was exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during military service and the exposure meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7), the following diseases will be service-connected even though there is no record of such disease during service, subject to the rebuttable presumption provisions of § 3.307(d): 1) kidney cancer; 2) liver cancer; 3) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 4) adult leukemia; 5) multiple myeloma; 6) Parkinson's disease; 7) aplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes; and 8) bladder cancer. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f).

As to the issue of lung cancer, the Veteran's military personnel records confirm that he served at Camp Lejeune, and VA has conceded exposure to the contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune. See April 2024 Rating Decision. Accordingly, he is presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune. However, lung cancer is not a disease which may be presumptively service-connected due to exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f). Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to presumptive service connection for his lung cancer due to his contaminate exposure at Camp Lejeune.

As for direct service connection, the Veteran cannot meet the elements of direct service connection.

As to the first element, VA has conceded the Veteran was diagnosed with lung cancer. Again, VA favorably found: "[The Veteran has] been diagnosed with a disability. VA examination dated January 7, 2022 confirms a diagnosis of lung cancer." See April 2024 Rating Decision; January 2022 VA Examination Report. Thus, the first element of direct service connection is met.

As to the second element, while service treatment records are silent for any lung condition, VA has conceded the Veteran was exposed to water contaminates in the drinking supply while stationed at Camp Lejeune during service. See April 2024 Rating Decision. Thus, the second element of direct service connection is met.

As to the third element, the evidence of record does not show a nexus exists between the Veteran's lung cancer and his exposure ot contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.

In an August 2023 VA medical opinion, an examiner opined the Veteran's claimed lung cancer was less likely than not caused by the indicated contaminate exposure, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned the Veteran's extensive smoking history more likely contributed to the Veteran lung cancer than his exposure to contaminates in the Camp Lejeune drinking water. The examiner stated the most important risk factor for developing lung cancer is smoking. The Veteran smoked for 30 years. Accordingly, the examiner concluded it is much more likely that smoking contributed to the development of Veteran's lung cancer. Thus, the examiner found no nexus.

The Board weighs the August 2023 VA medical opinion and notes no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, and because the opinion is based on the Veteran's statements, and medical and military history, the Board finds it is entitled to significant probative weight. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008). Thus, the probative evidence of record does not show a nexus exists between the Veteran's lung cancer and his exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune. Instead, the August 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's history of smoking more likely caused the Veteran's lung cancer.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent and credible to report his observable symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). Additionally, the Board has no reason to question the credibility of the Veteran's contentions regarding his lung cancer. However, while the Veteran may report the contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune caused his lung cancer, the Board notes the Veteran is not competent to provide a medical opinion, as he does not have the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). The Board finds the VA examiner's opinion more probative as it was rendered by a medical professional based on accepted medical principles. 

As the probative evidence of record indicates the Veteran's lung cancer did not manifest in service and was not diagnosed until 2021, over four decades after service, and is not etiologically related to service, to include exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune, entitlement to service connection for lung cancer is denied. Additionally, lung cancer cannot be presumptively service connected due to exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right-hand condition, muscle deterioration, is denied.

The Veteran contends his right-hand condition is due to drinking contaminated water at Camp Lejeune during service. See June 2021 Statement in Support of Claim.

The AOJ identified several favorable findings, including: (1) the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability as the Birmingham VAMC examination records show treatment for lost muscle and body weight; and (2) the Veteran served at Camp Lejeune, and contaminated water exposure is conceded. See April 2024 Rating Decision.

While VA has conceded exposure to the contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune and he is presumed to have been exposed to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune, the right-hand conditions are not diseases which may be presumptively service-connected due to exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune. See April 2024 Rating Decision; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f).  Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to presumptive service connection for his right-hand condition due to his contaminate exposure at Camp Lejeune.

As for direct service connection, the Veteran cannot meet the elements of direct service connection.

As to the first element, VA has conceded the Veteran was diagnosed with a lost muscle and body weight disability. See April 2024 Rating Decision. In a June 2023 VA examination report, a VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with entrapment of the right ulnar nerve. The Veteran reported onset in 2019. The condition began overnight, and the Veteran could not recall a specific incident associated with this right-hand condition. Thus, the first element of direct service connection is met.

As to the second element, while service treatment records are negative for any right hand complaints, VA has conceded the Veteran's exposure to water contaminates while stationed at Camp Lejeune during service. See April 2024 Rating Decision. Thus, the second element of direct service connection is met.

As to the third element, the evidence of record does not show a nexus exists between the Veteran's diagnosed right-hand conditions and his exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.

In June 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. In a medical opinion following the June 2023 VA examination, the examiner opined the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated contaminated water exposure, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran was not claiming a presumptive disease contemplated by the regulations concerning the Camp Lejeune presumptive disease. Thus, service connection based on presumptive service connection is not available to the Veteran. On a direct service connection basis, the examiner noted there is no evidence of an association between the Camp Lejeune water contaminates of trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), vinyl chloride (VC), and benezene, and the Veteran diagnosed entrapment of right ulnar nerve. Thus, there is no medical literature to support a positive nexus opinion. The examiner also stated: "no nexus is reasonable."

The Board weighs the June 2023 VA medical opinion and notes no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, and because the opinion is based on the Veteran's statements, and medical and military history, the Board finds it is entitled to significant probative weight. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008). Thus, the probative evidence of record does not show a nexus exists between the Veteran's claimed right-hand condition and his exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune. Instead, the June 2023 VA examiner reported no reasonable medical nexus between the right-hand condition and the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent and credible to report his observable symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). Additionally, the Board has no reason to question the credibility of the Veteran's contentions regarding his right-hand condition. However, while the Veteran may report the contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune caused his right-hand condition, the Board notes the Veteran is not competent to provide a medical opinion, as he does not have the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). The Board finds the VA examiner's opinion more probative as it was rendered by a medical professional based on accepted medical principles. 

As the probative evidence of record indicates the Veteran's right hand condition did not manifest in service, did not manifest until 2019, over four decades after service, and is not etiologically related to service, to include exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune, entitlement to service connection for right hand condition is denied. Additionally, the right-hand condition cannot be presumptively service connected due to exposure to contaminates in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune.
