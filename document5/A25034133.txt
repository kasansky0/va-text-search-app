DOCKET NO. 241021-484102
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

An effective date earlier than February 15, 2023, for the award of service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) received the Veteran's 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim from which his claim arose on February 15, 2023.

2. The most probative and persuasive evidence reflects that entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea arose prior to February 15, 2023. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023, for the award of service connection for sleep apnea are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Navy on active duty from August 2001 to August 2011 and from July 2020 to September 2021. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

EED Sleep Apnea

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023, for the award of service connection for sleep apnea. See October 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Since March 24, 2015, all claims must be filed on a prescribed form. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151. A veteran may indicate an intent to file a claim by saving an electronic application, submitting an intent to file claim form, or orally communicating the intent to a designated VA personnel that is then recorded in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). The VA will consider the first VA Form 21-526EZ or VA Form 20-0995 received within one year from receipt of the intent to file as filed on the date the intent to file was received. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501. For effective dates, supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of the decision the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (h)(2). 

As an initial matter, VA received a Form 21-0966 Intent to File on September 8, 2021. However, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea on February 15, 2023, more than one year from the September 2021 Intent to File. Service connection was granted in a May 2024 rating decision, effective February 15, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's claim.

Having determined the appropriate date of claim, the Board must determine the date entitlement arose. Here, VA and private treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with sleep apnea in September 2018. See May 2024 Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire; February 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that an effective date prior to February 15, 2023, is not warranted.  In this regard, the record reflects that VA received the Veteran's claim on February 15, 2023.  The evidence shows that entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea arose prior to the claim, as the Veteran was diagnosed in September 2018. As such, the RO assigned the earliest possible effective date for its grant of service connection, which as noted above was received by VA on February 15, 2023. The Board acknowledges the arguments set forth by the Veteran regarding the onset of his symptoms; however, the pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by that authority. Therefore, an earlier effective date is not warranted.   As the weight of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.
