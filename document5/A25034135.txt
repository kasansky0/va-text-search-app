ORDER

The reduction of the Veteran's rating for diabetes mellitus type I with erectile dysfunction and retinopathy (diabetes) from 60 percent to 20 percent effective January 9, 2024 was improper; the appeal is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran did not receive proper due process notice.

2. There has not been material improvement of the Veteran's diabetes under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The reduction of the Veteran's rating for diabetes from 60 percent to 20 percent effective January 9, 2024 was improper; the 60 percent rating is restored.  38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.105, 3.344, 4.119, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7913. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2005 to June 2014 with an additional period of active duty for training.

In a March 2024 rating decision, the Veteran's rating for diabetes was decreased from 60 percent to 20 percent effective January 9, 2024.  In May 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 to appeal the rating reduction to the Board's Direct Review Docket.  Thus, the Board will review the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.

The propriety of the reduction of the Veteran's rating for diabetes from 60 percent to 20 percent effective January 9, 2024

In a June 2024 Informal Hearing Presentation, the Veteran's representative argues that the rating reduction was not proper because (1) the Veteran was not notified of the rating reduction consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) and (2) there was not material improvement in his diabetes.  As discussed below, the Board finds that because the Veteran did not receive proper due process notice, the rating reduction was void ab initio. Moreover, there was not material improvement in the Veteran's diabetes. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), when the RO considers reducing a rating that will result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation, it must issue a proposed rating decision that sets forth "all material facts and reasons" for the determination. See also Breland v. McDonough, 22 F.4th 1347, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2022). In this case, the RO reduced the Veteran's rating in the March 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was not notified of the proposed reduction, provided with an opportunity to appear at a hearing, or provided with an opportunity to additional present evidence to show that compensation should be continued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). see March 2024 Rating Decision, showing in relevant part, a combined rating to 100 percent from August 11, 2023, and a 90 percent rating from January 9, 2023. Thus, the rating reduction was improper.

Also, a veteran's disability rating shall not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred.? 38?U.S.C. §?1155.? When an AOJ reduces a veteran's disability rating without following the applicable regulations, the reduction is void ab initio.? Greyzck v. West, 12?Vet. App.?288, 292 (1999).?? 

Where a rating has been in effect for five years or more, a?reduction?is allowed only if there is material improvement that is reasonably certain to be maintained under the ordinary conditions of work and life.?38 C.F.R. §?3.344(a).  It must also be determined whether the examination reports reflecting such improvement are based upon thorough examinations.  The?reduction?in rating must be based upon review of the entire history of the Veteran's disability and supported by the evidence on file at the time of the?reduction.  Moreover, though a rating?reduction?must have been supported by the evidence on file at the time of the?reduction, pertinent post-reduction?evidence favorable to restoring the rating also must be considered. If doubt remains, after affording due consideration to all the evidence, the rating agency will continue the rating in effect.?38 C.F.R. §?3.344(b). 

Under DC 7913, the rating criteria provides that a 20 percent rating is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin and restricted diet or oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet; a 40 percent rating is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities (defined within the DC as avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities); a 60 percent rating is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated; and a 100 percent rating is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. 38?C.F.R. §?4.119.? 

Competent medical evidence is required to establish "regulation of activities," namely, avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities, for a 40 percent rating under DC 7913.?Camacho?v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?360, 364?(2007).? 

Because the criteria are joined by an "and," a claimant is required to demonstrate that all the criteria listed for a 40 percent rating are met.?Camacho,?21?Vet. App. at 366-67.  The DC for diabetes is successive because each higher rating requires the elements of the lower evaluation. Id., at 366.  The phrase "regulation of activities" is defined in DC 7913 as "avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities."  Medical evidence is required to support the "regulation of activities" criterion.?38?C.F.R. §?4.119, DC 7913;?Camacho,?21 Vet. App. at 364.? 

At the outset of this analysis, the Board notes that only the Veteran's rating for diabetes itself has been affected by the reduction.  All compensable ratings for residuals have remained the same or increased.  Thus, the Board is examining only the rating for diabetes itself and those symptoms contemplated by the criteria set forth in DC 7913 along with noncompensable complications.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, DC 7913.  Notably, at both the time of the present and most recent prior rating decisions adjudicating the Veteran's diabetes rating, retinopathy and erectile dysfunction were recognized as noncompensable complications of diabetes.

During service, the Veteran was diagnosed with diabetes.  Per an August 2013 treatment record, at the time of diagnosis, the Veteran had lost 20 percent of his weight compared to baseline.

A February 2015 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran had to be vigilant about his activity because any change in physical activity could trigger a hypoglycemic episode.

In January 2016, the Veteran, who works as a teacher, sought a reasonable accommodation to bring food and drink into the classroom to ensure he did not become hypoglycemic.

An April 2016 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran had very poor glycemic control.

The Veteran was afforded a VA Male Reproductive examination of his diabetes in July 2016.  The Veteran also had a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, which he treated with Viagra.

In January 2017, the Veteran reported that he would skip meals when his blood sugar was too high to avoid hyperglycemia.

In July 2017, the Veteran reported having high blood sugar at night, and the clinician concluded that his insulin was not enough to prevent hyperglycemia at bed time.

In October 2017, the Veteran reported having a few hypoglycemic episodes, sometimes in the middle of the night.

In April 2018, the Veteran began using an insulin pump, rather than taking insulin injections, to control his diabetes.  This led to fewer hypoglycemia episodes.

In September 2021, the Veteran was hospitalized for hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis after his insulin pump malfunctioned.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his diabetes in November 2021.  The Veteran controlled his diabetes with a restricted diet, more than one insulin injection per day, and regulation of activities.  He visited a diabetic care provider less than twice per month for episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia.  He had been hospitalized 3 or more times for ketoacidosis in the past year.  Unintentional weight loss of 12.5 percent of body weight was noted.  The Veteran was able to work, but he limited strenuous activity (lifting heavy things) and had to leave work because of elevated blood sugar twice in the previous 6 months and was sometimes late to work due to his morning glucose levels.

A January 2022 VA treatment record notes that hypoglycemia had become infrequent.  An October 2022 VA treatment record again notes infrequent hypoglycemia.  His blood sugars would trend low if he ate late or when he was more active, such as after exercising at 3 p.m.  His blood sugar may trend higher after lunch.  He had been seen for diabetic ketoacidosis 5 times since 2013, with the last hospitalization about a year prior, in September 2013.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his diabetic eye disorders in November 2022.  A diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy was noted, but uncorrected and corrected near and distance vision were 20/20 or better.  The macula had a few pinpoint hemes.  There was no defect to visual field.

More recently in January 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination of his diabetes.  He managed his diabetes with restricted diet and insulin more than once per day.  There was no regulation of activities required.  He was seen by a diabetic care provider for hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis less than twice per month.  He had not been hospitalized for ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia in the past year.  There had been no progressive unintentional weight loss or loss of strength attributable to diabetes over the past two years.  The Veteran still had diabetic retinopathy, though his near and distance corrected and uncorrected vision remained 20/20 or better.  There was no contraction of visual fields.  A diagnosis of vitreous degeneration was also noted, though the examiner did not identify that this disorder was part of the diabetic process or identify any symptoms of this disorder.  The Veteran still had erectile dysfunction, though no functional impairment was noted beyond diagnosis.

However, in February 2024, the Veteran was seen in the emergency room for hyperglycemia and dehydration.  He reported having blurred vision and leg cramps.  His blood sugars had spiked to between 400 and 600.  By the time he was seen, his blood sugar had begun to stabilize and was down to 379.  By the time of discharge, the Veteran's glucose was down to 242 and he began feeling much better.  It was believed that the hyperglycemia was due to an acute infection or the effect of other medication.

The Board finds that there has not been material improvement of the Veteran's diabetes under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  When first diagnosed in 2013, the Veteran experienced unintentional weight loss and poor hypoglycemic control.  Even in April 2016, the Veteran was noted to have very poor glycemia control.  This led to 5 hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis between 2013 and 2021.  In April 2018, the Veteran began using an insulin pump and began experiencing less hypoglycemia.  Unfortunately, in September 2021, the pump malfunctioned which led to the Veteran being hospitalized for hyperglycemia.  Again, in February 2024, the Veteran required treatment at the emergency room for a hyperglycemic episode.  This is akin to a hospitalization and occurred within the year prior to the rating decision implementing the rating reduction.  Therefore, the Veteran's diabetes likely more nearly approximates the 60 percent criteria under DC 7913.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Further, the Veteran does have two noncompensable complications of diabetes-erectile dysfunction and retinopathy-as required by the 60 percent criteria.  Therefore, the Board cannot say that there has been material improvement in the Veteran's diabetes such that a 20 percent rating would be warranted.  Therefore, the Veteran's diabetes has not materially improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work, and the rating reduction for diabetes was improper for these reasons as well.  

Because the Veteran did not receive proper due process notice, the rating reduction was void ab initio. Moreover, there was not material improvement in the Veteran's diabetes. Thus, the 60 percent rating for diabetes is restored effective January 9, 2024. The appeal is granted.
