REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a recurrent sleep disability to include obstructive sleep apnea is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from April 1970 to January 1972.  

On April 9, 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied sleep apnea.  On April 11, 2024, the Veteran was notified of the adverse decision and his appellate rights.  In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a recurrent sleep disability to include obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for a recurrent sleep disability is warranted as the diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea is related to head trauma including a cerebral concussion incurred in an in service May 1971 motor vehicle accident. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should obtain all relevant service records which could be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claim.  Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).  When a veteran identifies clinical treatment associated with specific military facilities, VA has a duty to either undertake an exhaustive record search or explain why such action is not justified.  Dixon v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 261, 264 (1992). 

A May 1971 Medical Condition Physical Profile Record indicates that the Veteran was placed on a physical profile due to a cerebral concussion.  The service treatment records do not refer to a cerebral concussion. 

A November 2023 written statement from the Veteran's spouse states that she was married to the Veteran during active service.  She recalled the Veteran was involved in a May 1971 motor vehicle accident in Germany and sustained facial injuries and a concussion.  The Veteran's spouse recalled that the Veteran was airlifted to the Nuremberg, Germany Army hospital where he was hospitalized until May 17, 1971.  Clinical documentation of the reported hospitalization has not been requested for incorporation into the record.  That is a pre-decisional error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) and/or the appropriate service entity and request that a search be made of the records of the records of the Nuremburg, Germany Army Hospital for May 1971 for any entries pertaining to his hospitalization for motor vehicle accident injuries. If no records are located, a written statement to that effect should be incorporated into the record.
