ORDER

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent disabling prior to March 31, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent disabling from March 31, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is denied.

Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent disabling, but no higher, from June 25, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is granted.

Entitlement to a separate 10 percent disability rating for left ankle instability is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to March 31, 2021, the Veteran's left ankle osteoarthritis was not manifested by marked limitation of motion.

2. From March 31, 2021, the Veteran's left ankle disability has been manifested by no worse than marked limitation of motion.  

3. From June 25, 2021, the Veteran's right ankle disability exhibited the functional equivalent of ankylosis in that his dorsiflexion measured 0 degrees and is more appropriately assessed under DC 5003-5270.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran has had slight instability of the left ankle throughout the period on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Prior to March 31, 2021, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left ankle osteoarthritis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5003-5271.  

2. From March 31, 2021, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left ankle osteoarthritis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5003-5271.

3. From June 25, 2021, the criteria for a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for left ankle osteoarthritis have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5003-5270.

4. The criteria for a separate 10 percent disability rating for left ankle instability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1996 to January 2000.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2018 rating decision that originated in the Legacy appeals system.

In an April 2024 decision, the Board remanded the claim for the issuance of a Statement of the Case (SOC) pursuant to Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238 (1999).

The AOJ issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) in April 2024.  In June 2024, the Veteran opted into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from the April 2024 SOC by submitting a VA Form 10182, appealing his claim to the Board.

 In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 SOC.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the April 2024 SOC, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When there is a question between two evaluations, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Each disability is viewed in relation to its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  The Board notes that where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see also Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id. 

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Section 4.14 does not preclude the assignment of separate evaluations for separate and distinct symptomatology where none of the symptomatology justifying an evaluation under one diagnostic code is duplicative of or overlapping, such as pyramiding, with the symptomatology justifying an evaluation under another diagnostic code.  Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994).

VA must consider all favorable lay evidence of record.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).  The Veteran is competent to testify in regard to the onset and continuity of symptomatology.  Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379, 384 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991).

The Board has reviewed all the evidence in the record.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that all of the evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).

When all the evidence is assembled, if there is a balance between positive and negative competent evidence then the issues shall be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  The functional loss may be due to absence of part or all of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as disabled.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.45, 4.59.  Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relate to painful motion, are not limited to arthritis, and must be considered when raised by the claimant or when reasonably raised by the record.  Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020).  These amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities."  Id.  If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021, and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.  

1. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent disabling prior to March 31, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is denied.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent disabling from March 31, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is denied.

3. Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent disabling, but no higher, from June 25, 2021, for service-connected osteoarthritis of the left ankle is granted.

4. Entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left ankle instability is granted.

The Veteran contends that the severity of his left ankle disability warrants higher ratings than are currently assigned.  Specifically, the Veteran contends that he is entitled to a separate analogous rating of at least 30 percent under DC 5284 for left ankle instability.  See June 2024 VA Form 10182.

By way of background, the Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for a left ankle condition in March 2018, which was denied in a December 2018 legacy rating decision.  The Veteran then filed another claim for service connection for the left ankle in May 2019 and was awarded service connection in a July 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran then filed a claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date in July 2019, claiming he should be provided an effective date of the intent to file that he submitted for his legacy claim.  In an August 2019 rating decision, the RO granted an effective date of service connection from January 16, 2018, the date he submitted his legacy intent to file.  The Veteran filed a December 2019 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), appealing the December 2018 rating decision, to include his left ankle condition.  The Veteran then filed an increased rating claim for his left ankle condition in March 2021.  However, the December 2019 NOD was still pending in the legacy system, as there is no indication that the Veteran withdrew his legacy appeal.  In an April 2024 decision, the Board remanded the issue to the AOJ for issuance of an SOC, which was issued in April 2024.  The Veteran appealed in the June 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran's left ankle disability is currently rated under hyphenated diagnostic code 5003-5271.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27. 

The rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Prior to February 7, 2021, the Board will consider the former version of the diagnostic codes only; however, for the period beginning February 7, 2021, the Board will consider both the old and amended version (amended code) of the diagnostic code and rate based on whichever is most favorable to the claimant.  See Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

The February 7, 2021, amended criteria updated Diagnostic Code 5003 to reflect that the code applies to degenerative arthritis; however, the rating criteria were not changed.  Diagnostic Code 5003 provides that arthritis can be rated at 10 percent for X-ray evidence of degenerative arthritis involving two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups.  A 20 percent rating is provided for degenerative arthritis of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Prior to February 7, 2021, under Diagnostic Code 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle and a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Normal dorsiflexion is 20 degrees.  Normal plantar flexion is 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

According to MERRIAM WEBSTER, "moderate" means "tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension".  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate.  "Marked" means "having a distinctive or emphasized character".  See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5271.  85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  Under the new criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion.)  A 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.)  As this regulatory change was enacted during the pendency of this appeal, the Board will consider both the old and new versions of the rating criteria from the effective date and apply the version most favorable to the Veteran.

A rating for an ankle disability may be assigned a rating higher than 20 percent under Diagnostic Code 5270, if ankylosis is present.  Under Diagnostic Code 5270, a 30 percent rating is warranted for ankylosis of the ankle in plantar flexion between 30 degrees and 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion, between zero degrees and 10 degrees.  A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for ankylosis of the ankle in plantar flexion at more than 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion at more than 10 degrees or with abduction, adduction, inversion, or eversion deformity.

More recently, in Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) resolved that the requirement of ankylosis in the General Rating Formula for Injuries and Diseases of the Spine can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e. functional immobility of the joint) during a flare-up.  The Court further resolved that ankylosis (and therefore, the consideration of functional ankylosis) is not limited to spinal joints but can occur in any joint.

Other diagnostic codes that apply to the ankle include DC 5272 subastragalar or tarsal joint ankylosis, DC 5273 malunion of the os calcis or astragalus, and DC 5274 astragalectomy.  None of these DCs apply to the Veteran's left ankle disability in this case and are not applicable herein.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran was afforded a VA Ankle Conditions examination in November 2018.  Based on an in-person examination and review of the Veteran's VA e-folder, the VA examiner reported a diagnosis of status post fracture right ankle with ORIF bone clip.  A diagnosis was not provided for the left ankle.  Upon examination, the Veteran's left ankle range of motion was all normal, with no pain noted on exam, no objective evidence of localized tenderness of pain on palpation, no evidence of pain with weight bearing, and no objective evidence of crepitus.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing of the left ankle with at least three repetitions with no loss of function or range of motion afterwards.  Regarding the left ankle, the Veteran had normal muscle strength, no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, no ankle instability or dislocation, no other ankle conditions, no surgical procedures, no other pertinent physical findings, and no scars.  The VA examiner reported that the Veteran constantly used a brace for his fractured right ankle and reported functional impact to the extent that the Veteran stated he was fired from one job due to not being able to tolerate walking, and that he states he has decreased mobility due to pain and stiffness in the right ankle.  The examiner remarked that the opposing joint (left ankle) was undamaged with no exam abnormalities.  See November 2018 VA examination report. 

The Veteran was afforded another VA Ankle Conditions examination in May 2019.  Based on an in-person examination and review of the Veteran's VA e-folder, the VA examiner reported diagnoses of osteoarthritis of the bilateral ankles.  The Veteran reported severe flare ups of both ankles that occur daily and last a few hours.  The Veteran reported functional loss or impairment to the extent that he can no longer play sports or run due to the pain.  Specifically with respect to the left ankle, the Veteran had dorsiflexion to 20 degrees and plantar flexion to 20 degrees.  The examiner reported that range of motion itself does not contribute to a function loss and that pain was noted on exam but does not result in/cause functional loss.  Pain was noted on exam with both dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and there was evidence of pain with weight bearing, but there was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation and no objective evidence of crepitus.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion afterwards.  The Veteran was not examined immediately after repetitive use over time nor during a flare up, but the VA examiner reported that pain significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time and during a flare up and estimated range of motion as dorsiflexion to 10 degrees and plantar flexion to 20 degrees with repeated use over time and during a flare up.  The examiner reported additional factors contributing to disability including disturbance of locomotion and interference with standing. 

The Veteran exhibited normal muscle strength, no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, and no ankle instability or dislocation.  The VA examiner reported that the Veteran did not have shin splints, stress fractures, Achilles tendonitis, Achilles tendon rupture, malunion of calcaneus or talus, and that the Veteran had not had a talectomy.  The examiner reported no surgical procedures and no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, or scars.  The examiner reported that the Veteran did not use assistive devices.  The examiner reported functional impact to the extent that the Veteran is unable to walk or stand for long periods of time.  The examiner reported that there is no evidence of pain on non-weight bearing testing or on passive range of motion testing of the left ankle.  See May 2019 VA examination report. 

The Veteran was afforded another VA Ankle Conditions examination in June 2021.   Based on an in-person examination and review of the Veteran's VA e-folder, the VA examiner confirmed the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the left ankle.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report of a 3/22/2021 right ankle sprain after it gave out on him; and that a CT showed swelling and he was put in an air cast, then in a boot for a month.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report that he currently has pain in both ankles, right worse than left, and a rubbing sensation; that the baseline pain was 5/10 in the left ankle and 7/10 in the right ankle; that the right ankle feels like it will give out; that both ankles feel weak; and that he has to focus on where both feet are due to propensity to roll.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report of treatment including a right ankle brace and a cane.  Regarding the left ankle, the Veteran reported daily flare ups that last a couple of hours including burning and 7/10 severity that feel like the ankle won't move and that it is hard to walk on until it passes.  The Veteran reported functional loss or impairment due to the left ankle to the extent that he can't walk far, can't run, driving is a problem, he has to shift around a lot, standing a few minutes, no squatting or kneeling, has to use cane, avoids steps, frequent tripping, ladders are challenging, and bearing weight is difficult due to weakness of the ankle.  The examiner noted the Veteran's report that he has instability of the left ankle and that he has to be careful as the joint has a tendency to roll.

With respect to the left ankle, upon examination, the VA examiner reported that the Veteran's left ankle range of motion was abnormal and that there is no dorsiflexion, making full stride more difficult, as he has to rely on foot to allow forward momentum.  The examiner reported plantar flexion to 40 degrees and dorsiflexion to 0 degrees.  Pain was noted on examination with both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's ankle is most comfortable in 20 degrees of dorsiflexion, but he is able to bring to 0.  Passive range of motion was the same as active range of motion, and pain was noted with both plantar flexion and dorsiflexion.  The examiner reported evidence of pain with weight-bearing, non-weight-bearing, active motion, and passive motion that causes functional loss; and that there is decreased tolerance for ambulation, steps, and climbing.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus, but there was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation, described as moderate burning in the lateral and medial malleolus, top of the lateral foot, arch of the foot, and + squeeze test of the tibia/fibula, directly related to the claimed left ankle condition.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive-use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of functional or range of motion afterwards.  The Veteran was not examined immediately after repetitive use over time, but the VA examiner reported that evidence suggests that pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time and estimated this loss as plantar flexion to 30 degrees and dorsiflexion to 0 degrees.  Similarly, the Veteran was not examined during a flare up, but the VA examiner reported that evidence suggests that pain significantly limits functional ability during a flare up and estimated this loss as plantar flexion to 10 degrees and dorsiflexion to 0 degrees.  The examiner reported no additional factors contributing to disability.

The VA examiner reported that the Veteran did not have muscle atrophy and did not have ankylosis.  Regarding joint stability, the examiner reported that there is absence of firm end point with asymmetric or excessive motion and that there is asymmetric or excessive motion.  The examiner reported that the Veteran does not have shin splints, stress fractures, Achilles tendonitis, Achilles tendon rupture, malunion of calcaneus or talus, and has no history of talectomy.  The examiner reported no history of surgical procedures, and no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the left ankle.  The examiner reported that the Veteran constantly uses a cane due to arthritis of both ankles and tendinopathy of the right ankle.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's condition impacts his ability to work and that for 3 months he has been unable to stand, walk, and squat; that the Veteran's job requires climbing tanks and rail cars; and that ladders are always iffy due to risk of ankles giving out.  See June 2021 VA examination report. 

The Board notes that a review of the Veteran's treatment records does not reveal symptoms more severe than those reported in the VA examination reports as discussed above.  The Board notes that the record does reflect complaints of pain, locking, and buckling in the left ankle.  Specifically with respect to assistive devices, the Board notes that, the record indicates that the Veteran uses various braces for his right ankle, including an air cast after a March 2021 right ankle sprain, and a DeRoyal BOA ankle support with BOA and uprights.  See March 2021 and October 2022 VA treatment records.  The record also reflects that the Veteran requested two braces for his right ankle because he wears it to work and for everyday use.  See May 2022 VA treatment records.  However, there is no indication that the Veteran has been prescribed a brace for his left ankle. 

The Veteran contends that a higher rating for the severity of his left ankle disability is warranted.  

Based on the discussion above, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent disabling prior to March 31, 2021, is not warranted.  The evidence shows that the Veteran had no more than moderate limitation of motion. His plantar flexion was less than 30 degrees, and his dorsiflexion was less than 15 degrees; however, his plantar flexion was not less than 10 degrees, and his dorsiflexion was not less than 5 degrees at worst. 

The Veteran was granted an increased rating of 20 percent disabling under DC 5003-5271 based on the results of the June 2021 VA Ankle Conditions examination and assigned an effective date of March 31, 2021, for the increase.  The Board notes that this effective date is erroneous, as the Veteran's increased rating claim was still on appeal due to the timely filing of his NOD, and the true date of his 20 percent rating based on the effective date rules should have been the date of his June 25, 2021, VA examination. The Board, however, will not disturb the effective date of the 20 percent rating.

As previously noted, 20 percent is the highest possible rating under DC 5271.  Thus, the question for the Board is whether the evidence demonstrates that there is ankylosis or functional ankylosis to warrant a higher rating under DC 5270.  See Chavis, 34 Vet. App. 1.

As discussed above, at the June 2021 VA examination, the Veteran's left ankle initial range of motion was noted to include dorsiflexion to 0 degrees and plantar flexion to 40 degrees.  After repetitive use over time, his range of motion was estimated to be dorsiflexion to 0 degrees and plantar flexion to 30 degrees.  During a flare up, his range of motion was estimated to be dorsiflexion to 0 degrees and plantar flexion to 10 degrees.  

After a review of the evidence, and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003-5270 have been met from June 25, 2021, the date of the VA examination showing this level of impairment.  Specifically, the Board notes that the June 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran's left dorsiflexion was indicated to be 0 degrees, indicating functional ankylosis per Chavis.

However, the Board finds that the criteria of a higher 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5003-5270 have not been met.  No VA examination has indicated ankylosis of the ankle in plantar flexion at more than 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion at more than 10 degrees or with abduction, adduction, inversion, or eversion deformity.  As stated above, the Veteran's dorsiflexion is limited to 0 degrees, indicating functional immobility of the joint at that point.

In sum, the Board finds that an initial rating in excess of 10 percent disabling prior to March 31, 2021, and a rating in excess of 20 percent disabling from March 31, 2021, under DC 5003-5271 are not warranted.  To that extent, the claim is hereby DENIED.   However, the Board finds that a rating of 30 percent disabling from June 25, 2021, under DC 5003-5270, is warranted.  To this extent, the claim is hereby GRANTED. 

Separate Rating Based on Instability

The Board finds that a separate rating for left ankle instability is also warranted for the entire period on appeal.  Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities from the same injury if the symptomatology for the conditions is not duplicative or overlapping; however, the evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided.  Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  DC 5271 evaluates limited motion of the ankle but does not contemplate instability or laxity.  Therefore, a rating under DC 5271 does not preclude a separate additional rating for ankle instability or laxity.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).

The Veteran's right ankle instability is rated by analogy under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a DC 5257, applicable to knee instability.  When an unlisted condition is encountered, as with ankle instability, it is permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's representative contends that the Veteran's left ankle instability should be rated by analogy to DC 5284, foot injuries, other.  The Board finds, however, that ankle instability is more closely analogous to DC 5257, applicable to knee instability.

Prior to February 7, 2021, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a DC 5257 governed instability and recurrent subluxation and for 10 percent disability rating required slight lateral instability or recurrent subluxation.  A 20 percent rating required moderate lateral instability or recurrent subluxation.  A 30 percent disability rating required severe lateral instability or recurrent subluxation.  Id.

The terms "slight," "moderate" and "severe" are not defined in the rating schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to arrive at a just and equitable decision.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  The use of such terminology by VA examiners and others, although an element to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue.  All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.  According to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "slight" means small in amount.  "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect.  "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.

As of February 7, 2021, under DC 5257 (under the amended regulatory criteria) instability is broken into two categories, (1) recurrent subluxation or instability, and (2) patellar instability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257).

For (1), recurrent subluxation or instability due to sprains or ligament tears causing persistent instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there is no prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is a medical provider who prescribes either a brace or an assistive device for ambulation and there is persistent instability from ligament tears or sprains.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when there is a prescription from a medical provider for both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation.  Id.

For (2), patellar instability is defined as a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.  The patellofemoral complex for Code 5257 is defined as consisting of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  A note clarifies that a surgical procedure that does not involve repair to at least one of the patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for this Code.  Id.  For patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without a surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following a brace, cane, or walker.  A 30 percent rating is warranted when there is a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace, and either a cane or walker.  Id.

The Board observes that the Veteran is competent to provide lay testimony as to instability.  See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347 (2018).  Although the November 2018 and May 2019 VA examiners did not report findings of instability, the Veteran has reported a history of instability and giving way in the ankle.  Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran has experienced instability in the left ankle for the entire period on appeal.  

In consideration of the Veteran's left ankle disability during the appeal period, his VA examinations, treatment records, and reports and statements of instability, the Board finds that his left ankle instability manifested as slight, which warrants a 10 percent disability rating.   

The Board also finds that in consideration of the February 7, 2021, regulatory changes the Board's finding of a 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's left ankle disability would not change.  The 10 percent disability rating, after the regulatory changes, requires a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  During the appeal period, while the medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran uses a cane and that he has been prescribed various braces for his right knee, there is no evidence showing that the Veteran received a prescription for an assistive device from a medical provider for ambulation for his left ankle disability.  The Veteran's left ankle disability prior to and after the regulatory changes would remain at a 10 percent disability rating.

The Board further finds that the Veteran does not meet the 20 percent disability rating prior to the February 7, 2021, regulatory changes as his instability during the appeal period did not manifest to a moderate degree.  While the Veteran has reported use of a cane, the objective medical evidence does not show findings consistent with a moderate level of disability.  The Board also finds that a 20 percent disability rating under the post February 7, 2021, regulatory changes is also not warranted as the Veteran has not been prescribed an assistive device by a medical provider for his left knee. 

Resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, therefore, the Board finds that the criteria for a separate 10 percent rating for left ankle instability have been met.  To this extent, the claim is hereby GRANTED.
