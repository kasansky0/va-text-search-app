FINDING OF FACT

On April 9, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written notification from the Veteran's representative that a withdrawal of the appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1972 to March 1974.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected Direct review.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. In April 2025, the Veteran's representative submitted written correspondence that includes the Veteran's name and applicable VA file number.  The statement indicated that the Veteran wished to "withdraw the BVA appeal submitted on 10/17/2024.  This was submitted in error."  All criteria for a valid withdrawal are met.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
