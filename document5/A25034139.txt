REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who earned a Purple Heart during service in Vietnam, had active service from February 1968 to June 1971. The Board recognizes his service to our country, and the sacrifices it necessarily entailed.

This matter is on appeal to the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is also the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In January 2024, the Veteran sought service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a TDIU.  In a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD, effective January 25, 2024. In the July 2024 rating decision on appeal here, the AOJ denied a TDIU, denied an increased rating for PTSD, and reduced the rating for lumbosacral strain from 40 to 20 percent. The Veteran appealed each of these decisions.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement or NOD), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. In April 2025, the Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge, and waived his right to post-hearing evidence submission. Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted during the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301 and?20.302.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. § 20.900 (c). 

1. Entitlement to a (TDIU), from January 25, 2024, but no earlier, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a TDIU rating because he is not able to work due to symptoms of his service-connected lumbar spine, left knee, PTSD and other disabilities.  See January 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ and January 2024 VA Form 21-8940, Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. A total disability rating for compensation purposes may be assigned on the basis of individual unemployability when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

In such an instance, if there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

Thus, as of January 24, 2022, the Veteran qualified for schedular consideration. His two right shoulder disabilities are considered a single disability for purposes of determining whether a veteran qualifies for schedular TDIU consideration, and thus he had a single disability rated at 40 percent. His other service-connected disabilities combined with his shoulder disabilities to give him an overall rating of 70 percent. 

In a February 2022 VA examination, the examiner found that range of motion limitations caused pain and functional loss, interfering with moving, sitting and standing. The Veteran reported daily flare-ups that last minutes or days, brought on by prolonged sitting, standing, walking, bending and lifting, thereby impairing his ability to perform occupational tasks. See February 2022 VA examination. Flare-ups can require bed rest as often as three to four days a week. See September 2024 VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (Statement).   

In addition, the Veteran has service-connected disabilities limiting mobility in his legs. His left knee, which has limited range of motion, is painful, weak, flares and buckles and becomes stiff. Thus, his knee condition prevents him from prolonged standing and walking.  See March 2022 VA examination. He also has sciatica and radiculopathy associated with his lumbar spine injury, causing constant pain and numbness in both legs. See June 2024 VA examination.

The Veteran's shoulder injury is also painful and limiting. His wife observed that due to his right shoulder injury, he has lost strength in his right arm and developed a tremor that affects his ability to write. See January 2022 Buddy/Lay Statement. 

The Board finds the Veteran's wife credible and competent in her observation of whether the Veteran could perform the physical and mental acts required by employment. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("neither the statute nor the relevant regulations require the combined effect [of disabilities] to be assessed by a medical expert").

Overall, these physical limitations preclude manual labor, but at that point, the Veteran was not yet truly unemployable based solely on service-connected disabilities because his disabilities were exclusively physical, and he holds a degree in Medical Science as a Physician's Assistant from Wake Forest University Medical School, and worked from 1984 until 2006 for 3M in pharmaceutical sales. See June 2024 VA Form 21-4192 and June 2024 VA examination. 

Thus, the Board finds while he was clearly unable to continue in his then-occupation due to the need to travel, he would have been able to work in a gainful occupation that did not involve extensive movement or other physical exertion.

Once the Veteran's PTSD was added to his disability picture on January 25, 2024, however, the alternative of engaging in sedentary work was effectively eliminated-his ability to concentrate, communicate, and collaborate were significantly and adversely affected to the point he was no longer capable of performing either physical or mental tasks necessary to secure and maintain gainful employment. See, e.g., Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). 

Specifically, the July 2024 VA examination findings indicate that the Veteran has employment-limiting mental health symptoms from his PTSD. The examiner found that his ability to function in an occupational environment is limited by intrusive thoughts that interfere with the ability to stay focused on the task at hand. 

In addition, the Veteran has significant difficulty accepting supervision or receiving instructions without becoming angry. The examiner found that he has mental health problems that interfere significantly with the ability to work, which may include panic attacks, irritability, and suspiciousness. These findings are supported by his wife's acknowledgement that he can be impatient and that she has been fearful of him due to these symptoms. See July 2024 VA examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively demonstrates the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.  The Board considered whether the evidence supports a remand for referral to the Director, Compensation Services for extraschedular consideration for the period prior to January 24, 2022, but such a remand is warranted only when the evidence substantiates a "reasonable possibility that the veteran is unemployable" because of their service-connected disabilities. Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1, 7-8 (2021) citing Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 66. 

For the reasons explained above concerning the Veteran's high level of education and the particulars of his professional experience, the Board finds there is no reasonable possibility extraschedular TDIU would be granted.

Accordingly, the Board finds a TDIU is warranted from January 25, 2024, and to that extent only, the appeal is granted.

 

2. Entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent rating for lumbosacral strain is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD is dismissed.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Oral withdrawal of an appeal is effective provided the withdrawal is explicit and unambiguous, and the appellant understands the consequences of their decision. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011).

At the April 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran requested that his appeal for entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent rating for lumbosacral strain and an increased rating for PTSD be withdrawn. The Veteran was informed that as a result of his request, those issues would be dismissed from this appeal, and the VA would take no further action on those claims. The Veteran stated that he understood this, and that he wished to withdraw his appeal. 

Therefore, as to these issues, the appeal is dismissed.
