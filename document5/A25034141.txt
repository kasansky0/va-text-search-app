REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for keloid skin condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2008 to November 2008 and from October 2009 to May 2010. 

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the AMA, applies.

In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2022 rating decision.  In February 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found a duty to assist error and subsequently issued the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran timely appealed the November 2023 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for keloid skin condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In September 2024, the Board notified the Veteran that the appeal has been placed on the Direct Review docket.  Thus, the appeal is properly before the Board, and this decision follows.

Entitlement to service connection for keloid skin condition is remanded.

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to service connection for her keloid skin condition.  The Veteran asserts that her skin began to keloid after receiving the required smallpox vaccination for deployment.  See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.

In general, to prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be established by credible lay evidence and medical evidence provided by the Veteran or otherwise.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with keloid skin condition.  See April 17, 2014 Medical Treatment Record; see also May 12, 2023 VA Examination.  Service treatment records document the Veteran was administered the smallpox vaccination on October 28, 2009.  The Veteran has a presumption of exposure to toxic risk exposure activities (TERA).  See December 2022 and January 2023 VA Memoranda.

On May 3, 2023 and on September 9, 2023, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations filed on May 12, 2023 and on September 10, 2023, respectively.  The examiners opined that the Veteran's scar, status post keloid lesions, was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's indicated TERA.  However, the examiners did not provide nexus opinions on whether the Veteran's keloid skin condition was due to her required smallpox vaccination.  As the AOJ had not sought an addendum to address whether the Veteran's keloid skin condition was due to her required smallpox vaccination, there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is necessary to address this deficiency.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made).

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate examiner to address the Veteran's service connection claim for keloid skin condition.  The examiner must determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's keloid skin condition and opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such condition is due to the Veteran's military service, to include smallpox vaccination.

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached.  The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.  Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.  

All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training). 

2. After ensuring full compliance with this remand, readjudicate the claim on appeal.
