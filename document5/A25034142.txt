ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

Readjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period of appeal, the allergic rhinitis has not resulted in greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides, complete obstruction on one side, or polyps.

2. An August 2019 rating decision denied service connection for sleep apnea and the Veteran did not appeal it. 

3. New and relevant evidence has not been received since the prior August 2019 rating decision that denied service connection for sleep apnea.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522.

2. The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from October 2014 to March 2018. The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his service.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). This law creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. See VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (September 2024). The Veteran appealed the January 2024 rating decision which provided a noncompensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected allergic rhinitis and stated that he wished to appeal a rating decision in 2019 for sleep apnea. However, in the Veteran's October 2024 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative clarified that the appeal was for the July 2024 rating decision, which denied service connection for sleep apnea. The Board notes that since the 2019 rating decision is more than one more prior to the VA form 10182 that was submitted in September 2024, it would not be a valid appeal. As such, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision for the rhinitis claim and at the time of the July 2024 rating decision for the sleep apnea claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that additional evidence was added to the Veteran's claims file after the rating decisions on appeal, including an October 2024 VA examination. Due to his selection of the Direct Review lane, this evidence is ineligible for review by the Board as it was received after the rating decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301. If the Veteran wants this evidence to be considered, he may file a supplemental claim in response to this decision.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civil occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

If there is disagreement with the initial rating assigned following a grant of service connection, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time, based on the facts found. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher rating for his service-connected allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis disability is currently assigned a 0 percent rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522 (allergic or vasomotor rhinitis). In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Under Diagnostic Code 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than fifty percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

By way of procedural background, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for allergic rhinitis in August 2023, which was granted in a January 2024 rating decision, and given a noncompensable rating, effective July 19, 2023.  The Veteran appealed the January 2024 rating decision in September 2024. 

Turning to the record, the Veteran was provided a VA Sinusitis, Rhinitis and Other Conditions of the Nose, Throat, Larynx and Pharynx Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) in January 2024. The Veteran was diagnosed with rhinitis and reported this condition beginning when he came back from active service. He noticed his eyes and nose were constantly red. His current symptoms are sneezing, runny nose, and red eyes. The Veteran noted that when he is outside in certain conditions, he constantly sneezes and blows his nose. Regarding his rhinitis, there was not greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both side or complete obstruction on one side. There were no nasal polyps or any granulomatous conditions. 

A review of all medical treatment records during the period on appeal, do not show the Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not resulted in greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides, complete obstruction on one side, or polyps.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted throughout the appeal period for the Veteran's rhinitis under Diagnostic Code 6522. During this period, the Veteran's rhinitis was primarily manifested by congestion, sneezing, and water eyes, without nasal polyps. The objective medical evidence, to include the VA examination report, did not show that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis resulted in greater than fifty percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side or polyps.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports that he experienced nasal congestion. However, the Veteran is not competent to determine the degree in which his nose was obstructed. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is simply not shown to exhibit any compensable manifestations. As such, the Board concludes that a compensable rating is not warranted under DC 6522 at any point throughout the appeal period.

Consideration has been given to the Veteran's statement that his rhinitis is more severe than evaluated. The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and has presented credible statements in this regard. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). The Board finds, however, that neither the Veteran's statements nor medical evidence demonstrates that the criteria for a compensable disability evaluation have been met. In determining the actual degree of disability, the examination findings are more probative of the degree of impairment.

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis, under Diagnostic Code 6522, is not warranted for the period on appeal. All evidence has been considered and there is no doubt to be resolved. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

Readjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

A claimant who is dissatisfied with a decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) may file a request for higher-level review under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 or appeal the claim to the Board under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 within a year of the AOJ's issuance of the notice of decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1). Alternatively, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Otherwise, that determination will become final. 38 C.F.R. §19.52.

On or after February 19, 2019, a Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, as the evidentiary record closes upon issuance of the notice, subject to later readjudicating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501, 19.2. If new and relevant evidence is presented with respect to the Supplemental Claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501. Evidence is new and relevant evidence if it (1) was not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators and, (2) tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). The new and relevant standard does not impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the previous new and material evidence standard under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a).

By way of procedural background, in June 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim for service connection for sleep apnea. In July 2019 the AOJ denied service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran submitted an additional VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim in July 2019 and the claim was again denied in an August 2019 rating decision. The Veteran did not request higher level review or appeal the August 2019 rating decision to the Board, nor did he submit a supplemental claim within the appeal period. Thus, that decision became final. In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking to reopen his claim for reconsideration for service connection for sleep apnea. In June 2024, a rating decision continued the previous denial for service connection for sleep apnea because the evidence submitted is not new and relevant. The Veteran submitted a July 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) appealing the June 2024 rating decision. A July 2024 HLR rating decision was provided which continued the previous denial for service connection for sleep apnea. Throughout the entire appeal period, the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea has been denied by the AOJ because of no current disability. 

Readjudication of the claim for service connection for sleep apnea. 

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that new and relevant evidence has not been submitted to readjudicate the claim for sleep apnea. The Board notes that the August 2019 rating decision denied the claim because of no evidence of current disability. The Board notes that the evidence added to the claims file since the August 2019 rating decision consisted of new evidence in the form of VA treatment records, but the evidence was not relevant to the issue on appeal. The VA records note that the Veteran reported his sleep hygiene as "horrible" and has chronic sleep impairment. 

Although laypersons, such as the Veteran, are sometimes competent to provide opinions on certain medical questions, the issues in this case fall outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person as it involves making definitive clinical diagnoses based on knowledge of pulmonology. See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011). While the Veteran is certainly competent to report his symptoms, he is not competent to attribute those complaints to a particular diagnosis or any diagnosis at all. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3 s 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (Lay persons are not competent to diagnose degenerative joint and disc disease and spinal stenosis as these are not manifested by external but rather internal signs visible only through medical imaging technology and requiring expertise in radiographic analysis to diagnose); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(1) (competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions). While the Veteran is competent to report on matters that he observed and his pain, he is not competent to diagnose disabilities, and the AOJ previously denied the Veteran's claim because the evidence did not show the Veteran had a current sleep disability. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). While the VA treatment records are new, they do not tend to prove or disprove whether the Veteran has a current sleep disability. 

The Board also notes the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination for his claimed sleep apnea disability; however, based on the evidence of record during the applicable period of appeal (prior to the July 2024 rating decision), a VA examination was not warranted. Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006), a VA medical examination must be provided when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i). As there is no evidence of current diagnoses of sleep apnea or any sleeping condition during the applicable period of appeal, a VA examination is not warranted prior to the July 2024 rating decision.

The Board has also thoroughly reviewed the remainder of the claims file and finds that there are no diagnoses related to sleep apnea during the period on appeal, which includes all evidence prior to the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.

In sum, the Veteran has not provided evidence of a current sleep disability since the July 2019 rating decision. For these reasons, the Board finds that readjudication of the claim for service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted.

The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his service, and regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.
