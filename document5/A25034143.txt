ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to a separate 30 percent rating, but not higher, for insomnia disorder is granted, effective February 20, 2024.

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), to include as due to asbestos exposure and/or secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the rating period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for bilateral tinnitus, and the evidence does not suggest that his symptoms of tinnitus are not adequately contemplated by the rating criteria.

2. The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms of service-connected insomnia disorder approximate occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

3. The persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's OSA had its onset in service, or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include participation in a toxic risk exposure activity (TERA), or that the condition is secondarily related to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260.

2. The criteria for a separate 30 percent rating, but not higher, for service-connected insomnia disorder are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.20, 4.126, 4.130, DC 9413.

3. The criteria to establish entitlement to service connection for OSA are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1966 to December 1968. 

On August 8, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, claiming service connection for OSA, to include as secondary to service-connected tinnitus. See Compensation (August 2023). A December 7, 2023, rating decision, denied service connection for OSA. See Rating Decision (December 2023). 

On February 12, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim Application, regarding the December 7, 2023, rating decision, pertaining to service connection for OSA. See VA Form 20-0995 (February 2024). On February 20, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, claiming service connection for insomnia secondary to service-connected tinnitus. See Compensation (February 2024). A May 28, 2024, supplemental claim decision, denied an increased rating for tinnitus with insomnia, stating that service connection for insomnia is granted as part of the Veteran's already service-connected tinnitus disability, and deferred a decision on entitlement to service connection for OSA. See Rating Decision (May 2024). A June 17, 2024, supplemental claim decision, denied service connection for OSA. See Rating Decision (June 2024). 

On September 3, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim Application, regarding the May 28, 2024, supplemental claim decision, pertaining an increased rating for tinnitus with insomnia; and regarding the June 17, 2024, supplemental claim decision, pertaining to service connection for OSA. See VA Form 20-0995 (September 2024). A January 7, 2025, supplemental claim decision, denied service connection for OSA and continued the 10 percent rating for tinnitus with insomnia. See Rating Decision (January 2025).

On February 25, 2025, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket. See VA 10182 (February 2025). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 7, 2025, supplemental claim decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board notes that the Veteran submitted evidence with his VA Form 10182 and thus explicitly waived a docket switch per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. In this regard, the Veteran submitted evidence on February 25, 2025, along with his VA Form 10182. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2025); Appellate Brief (February 2025). The March 2025 BVA Docketing Letter notified the Veteran he submitted additional documents and/or statements on or with his February 25, 2025, VA Form 10182, and because he selected the Direct Review option, the evidence cannot be legally considered by the Board. See BVA Docketing Letter (March 2025). 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §?20.800(c). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b).

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Other applicable, general policy considerations are: interpreting reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability, 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; resolving any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability in favor of the claimant, 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; where there is a question as to which of two evaluations apply, assigning a higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating, 38 C.F.R. § 4.7; and, evaluating functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness, and the effects of the disability upon the person's ordinary activity, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

VA will adjudicate as part of a claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision, including entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021) (holding that VA is required to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of an increased rating claim). A "complication" is a condition that is considered to be so closely related to the disability at issue that it may be considered a part of the service-connected disability.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus.

In February 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, claiming service connection for insomnia secondary to service-connected tinnitus. See Compensation (February 2024).

A May 2024 supplemental claim decision granted service connection for insomnia disorder and continued a 10 percent rating for the combined disability of tinnitus with insomnia disorder, under DC 6260. See Rating Decision (May 2024).

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim Application, regarding the May 2024 decision. See VA Form 20-0995 (September 2024). Next, the January 2025 supplemental claim decision on appeal continued the 10 percent rating for tinnitus with insomnia. See Rating Decision (January 2025). The Veteran appealed the January 2025 supplemental claim decision and contends that a separate compensable rating is warranted for service-connected insomnia disorder. See VA 10182 (February 2025). During the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran has not made specific contentions regarding the severity of service-connected tinnitus.

The AOJ has rated the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus as 10 percent disabling under DC 6260 throughout the rating period on appeal.

Pursuant to DC 6260, a 10 percent rating is warranted for recurrent tinnitus, whether it is perceived in one ear, both ears, or in the head. 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260. As tinnitus is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, it must be rated under the rating criteria of DC 6260. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) (when a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy); Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (2019).

Historically, service connection and a 10 percent rating were assigned for tinnitus in a May 2018 rating decision. See Rating Decision (May 2018). The Veteran was notified of this decision by a letter dated in May 2018, and he did not appeal it.

The instant appeal arose from the Veteran's February 2024 compensation claim of service connection for insomnia secondary to service-connected tinnitus. See Compensation (February 2024).

Tinnitus is defined as a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1930 (32nd ed. 2012).

As the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus throughout the rating period on appeal, there is no legal basis upon which a higher schedular rating may be assigned.

The Veteran has consistently reported that he has constant bilateral tinnitus. The August 2022 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination reflects the Veteran's description of his tinnitus as "constant ringing and crickets;" the examiner indicated that the condition impacts the ordinary conditions of daily life, because per the Veteran, "I ask people to repeat themselves." See C&P Exam (August 2022). The December 2022 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination reflects that Veteran's report that his tinnitus is constant; the examiner indicated that the condition impacts the ordinary conditions of daily life, because per the Veteran, his tinnitus affects his ability to understand speech and he frequently needs people to repeat themselves. See C&P Exam (December 2022). The Board finds that the Veteran's reported difficulties due to noise perceived in his ears are specifically contemplated by the rating assigned for bilateral tinnitus under DC 6260. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, DC 6260. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms and severity level are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria for tinnitus, and referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected tinnitus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board has also considered whether there are other manifestations of service-connected tinnitus that have not yet been adequately compensated. See Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 109 (2017) (noting that entitlement to a separate evaluation depends on whether the manifestations of disability for which a separate evaluation is being sought have already been compensated by an assigned evaluation under a different diagnostic code); Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 15-18 (2021).

In the January 2025 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that the Veteran's insomnia disorder was a symptom of his service-connected tinnitus. As discussed below, the Board is granting a separate 30 percent rating for service-connected insomnia disorder.

2. Entitlement to a separate compensable rating for service-connected insomnia disorder.

In February 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, claiming service connection for insomnia secondary to service-connected tinnitus. See Compensation (February 2024).

A May 2024 supplemental claim decision granted service connection for insomnia disorder and continued a 10 percent rating for the combined disability of tinnitus with insomnia disorder, under DC 6260. See Rating Decision (May 2024). The rating decision determined that the Veteran's insomnia disorder was a symptom of his service-connected tinnitus and that the disabilities must be rated together due to their similar symptomology because VA regulations prohibit pyramiding of symptoms.

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim Application, regarding the May 2024 decision. See VA Form 20-0995 (September 2024). Next, the January 2025 supplemental claim decision on appeal continued the 10 percent rating for tinnitus with insomnia. See Rating Decision (January 2025). The Veteran appealed the January 2025 supplemental claim decision and contends that a separate compensable rating is warranted for service-connected insomnia disorder. See VA 10182 (February 2025). Thus, he has continuously pursued the issue of entitlement to service connection for insomnia since February 20, 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c); Compensation (February 2024).

The Board finds that a separate compensable rating for service-connected insomnia disorder is warranted, because the Veteran has a current diagnosis of insomnia disorder under the DSM-5 criteria for a mental disorder. See C&P Exam(s) (February and September 2024); Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 404 (2020) (requiring a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnosis for a Veteran to be entitled to compensation for psychiatric symptoms caused by another service-connected disability).

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms of service-connected insomnia disorder cause the level of impairment required for a compensable disability rating.

A noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication, or to interfere with occupational and social functioning.

A 10 percent rating is assigned when mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of occasional stress, or symptoms controlled by medication cause occupational and social impairment.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms of service-connected insomnia disorder most closely approximate the symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating, and result in a level of impairment that most closely approximate the level of impairment associated with a 30 percent rating, but do not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent or higher. In this regard, the record shows that the Veteran's insomnia disorder was manifested by chronic sleep impairment and mild memory loss symptoms, which are associated with a 30 percent rating. The record does not reflect that the disorder was manifested by symptoms associated with a 50, 70, and/or 100 percent rating. The Veteran also had symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as fatigue and irritability.

The Board finds the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms contemplated by a 30 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 50 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126. The Veteran reported having occasional irritability. Further, fatigue and irritability are similar to chronic sleep impairment, which is contemplated by the assigned 30 percent rating.

The February 2024 VA mental disorders examination reflects a diagnosis of insomnia disorder, with occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of occasional stress, or symptoms controlled by medication. 

The Veteran reported having social support from his spouse and several friends. He reported that he likes to draw, write, and visit with others, as well as volunteering with prisoners in his free time. He reported that he cooks breakfast on Fridays for a men's Bible study group. The Veteran reported being retired, but that he works for the school system. 

The Veteran reported that he struggles with fatigue and occasional irritability due to his insomnia. He specifically denied having any past or current suicidal or homicidal ideation. He also specifically denied having any history of legal problems or violent behaviors. The examiner noted that the Veteran has chronic sleep impairment as a symptom attributable to his insomnia disorder.

The examiner noted that the Veteran arrived for his examination on time and drove himself. The examiner observed the Veteran as cooperative, and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The examiner noted that the Veteran's affect was topic-congruent, while his mood was euthymic. The examiner noted the absence of any abnormal motor movements. The examiner noted that the Veteran's speech was of normal rate, tone, and volume, and his though processes were goal-directed and logical. The examiner noted that the Veteran had a worn appearance, but he was casually dressed and displayed good hygiene. The examiner noted that the Veteran is capable of managing his financial affairs. See C&P Exam (February 2024). 

The September 2024 VA mental disorders examination reflects a diagnosis of insomnia disorder, with occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. 

The Veteran reported that his insomnia causes him to become irritable. He reported that he volunteers within prison ministries, and serves in various volunteer positions, including serving as a chairperson and cooking for Bible study groups. The examiner noted that the Veteran has chronic sleep impairment and mild memory loss as symptoms attributable to his insomnia disorder.

The examiner noted that the Veteran presented to the evaluation and appeared to be age appropriate, presenting as alert, oriented, and cooperative. The examiner noted that the Veteran's speech production was generally appropriate in volume, rate, rhythm, tone, and prosody. There was no evidence of blocking or pressured speech. The syntax and inflection of his speech was adequate. The examiner noted that the content of the Veteran's speech evidenced no peculiarities, including loosening of association and flight of ideas. The examiner noted that the Veteran's reported mood was reliably euthymic across the testing, and at no time during the evaluation did the Veteran evidence symptoms of a formal thought disorder or psychotic processes. The examiner noted that the Veteran's thought process was reliably clear, linear, organized, goal-directed, and devoid of any signs of preoccupations, obsessions, or paranoia. The examiner also noted that the Veteran did not present with delusions, including ideas of reference, thought broadcasting, thought insertion, or communication with gods, aliens, or ghosts. The examiner stated that the Veteran's attention, memory, judgment, and insight were deemed to be intact. The examiner noted that the Veteran is capable of managing his financial affairs. See C&P Exam (September 2024).

The Board finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms of insomnia disorder more closely approximates the level associated with a 30 percent rating. The Veteran experienced symptoms of chronic sleep impairment and mild memory loss, with unlisted symptoms of fatigue and irritability, which is most consistent with a 30 percent rating. The VA examinations reflect that the Veteran was generally calm and cooperative, alert and oriented, his mood was euthymic, thought process was linear and goal-directed, and speech was within normal limits. He had no suicidal or homicidal ideation, or hallucinations. 

Accordingly, the Veteran's symptoms are either contemplated by or more consistent with a 30 percent rating, effective February 20, 2024. Thus, the Board finds that a separate 30 percent rating is warranted for service-connected insomnia disorder and awards the same, but a rating in excess 30 percent is not supported. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; 4.130, Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.

3. Entitlement to service connection for OSA, to include as due to asbestos exposure and/or secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder.

The Veteran contends that his OSA was caused by his service, to include due to environmental/occupational exposures. Alternatively, he contends that his OSA is secondary to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. 

The Board notes that the January 2025 rating decision identified the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA, and (2) he participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) in the form of minimal probability of exposure to asbestos, due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) of personnel management specialist. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c); Rating Decision (January 2025). Thus, the current disability and in-service incurrence elements of this claim for direct service connection have been met.

Given the above, the only questions remaining before the Board are whether there is a nexus (1) between the Veteran's current diagnosis of OSA and his service, or (2) between his OSA and service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. 

The Board concludes that the weight of the persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's OSA had its onset in service or are not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include participation in a TERA, or that the condition is secondarily related to service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

Compensation may be awarded for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in- service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d). 

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or for additional disability resulting from the aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?439, 448 (1995) (en banc). 

A claim for secondary service connection requires medical evidence that connects the asserted secondary disability to the service-connected disability. Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998). In order to establish entitlement to service connection on this secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability. Id.

The Board concludes that the criteria to establish entitlement to service connection for OSA are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reflect no complaints or findings for OSA. The May 1967 Report of Medical History shows that the Veteran denied then having or ever having had frequent trouble sleeping. See STR - Medical at 10 (April 2018). The May 1967 Report of Medical Examination shows normal clinical evaluations of all systems, but for notation of astigmatism, allergies, and a scar. See STR - Medical at 16 (April 2018). The November 1968 Report of Medical History, at service separation, shows that the Veteran denied then having or ever having had frequent trouble sleeping. See STR - Medical at 1 (April 2018). The November 1968 Report of Medical Examination shows normal clinical evaluations of all systems, but for notation of a scar. See STR - Medical at 3 (April 2018).

Post-service treatment records show that OSA was first diagnosed in November 2018. See C&P Exam (September 2023). 

A May 2024 VA TERA Memorandum reflects that the Veteran had deployment related and non-deployment related exposure, in the form of minimal probability of asbestos exposure, by way of his MOS of personnel management specialist. See Other (May 2024).

A September 2023 VA sleep apnea examination reflects a diagnosis of OSA, with a date of diagnosis of November 2018, diagnosed by way of sleep study. The Veteran reported a history of poor sleep and snoring. See C&P Exam (September 2023). A September 2023 VA medical opinion shows that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of service-connected tinnitus. The examiner stated that OSA occurs when throat muscles intermittently relax and blook the airway during sleep. However, the examiner stated that there is no evidence in the medical literature to support a causal connection between tinnitus and the mechanical obstruction of the upper airways, which cause OSA. See C&P Exam (September 2023). 

In a June 2024 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of service-connected tinnitus with insomnia. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA. The examiner noted that sleep apnea is defined as a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. The examiner noted that risk factors for sleep apnea include obesity, respiratory issues, alcohol use, etc. The examiner stated, "[OSA] is not secondary to tinnitus with insomnia," or "a hazardous exposure." See C&P Exam (June 2024). 

In a December 2024 VA medical opinion, the examiner stated that OSA is a condition where the upper airway fails to maintain patency during sleep resulting in collapse, obstruction, periods of apnea, and daytime somnolence. The examiner stated that OSA is primarily caused by weight gain or obesity, and tinnitus is a sense of ringing in the ears. The examiner stated that tinnitus is an unrelated condition to sleep apnea. The examiner noted that insomnia is difficulty falling asleep, which is a separate condition from that of sleep apnea. The examiner stated that sleep apnea does not cause difficulty falling asleep and will cause sleep disruption for the periods of apnea that interrupt sleep. The examiner opined that tinnitus and insomnia do not cause OSA. Therefore, based on the body of current medical knowledge and the evidence of record, the examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely as not proximately due to or the result of tinnitus with insomnia. See C&P Exam (December 2024). 

In a December 2024 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, in the form of asbestos exposure. The examiner noted that the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA, was in service from 1966 to 1968, and had documented exposures during that time, per the May 2024 VA TERA Memorandum, to include exposure to asbestos. The examiner stated that OSA is a condition where the upper airway fails to maintain patency during sleep resulting in collapse, obstruction, periods of apnea, and daytime somnolence, which is primarily caused by weight gain or obesity and it is not known to be caused by any exposure event, including those experienced by the Veteran. The examiner noted that there is no medical literature that supports an association between OSA and exposure events. Therefore, based on the body of current medical knowledge and the evidence of record, the examiner opined that the Veteran's OSA was less likely as not caused by asbestos exposure, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran, and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. See C&P Exam (December 2024). 

Here, the evidence of record contains no competent nexus opinion linking the Veteran's current diagnosis of OSA and his service and/or service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. 

The Board accepts that the Veteran believes his OSA is linked to service and/or service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. However, he is not competent to link his OSA, first diagnosed years after service, to service and/or service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Therefore, the Veteran's opinions, in this regard, have no probative value. 

The Board assigns greater probative value to the Veteran's STRs, and VA medical opinions of record. This evidence shows no complaints or findings suggestive of possible in-service onset of OSA, and the Veteran specifically denied having frequent trouble sleeping in-service, which coupled with the many years intervening active duty and the first documented complaints/findings for OSA weigh against the claim. This evidence also does not show a competent nexus opinion linking the Veteran's current diagnosis of OSA and service-connected tinnitus and/or insomnia disorder.

On balance, the more persuasive evidence weighs against the claim. 

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.
