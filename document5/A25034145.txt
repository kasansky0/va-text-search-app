The appeal concerning entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 2017, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from September 2020 to October 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March and April 2024 rating decisions of a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Veteran subsequently filed a May 2024 VA Form 10182, requesting the evidence docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a written statement in March 2025 and withdrew this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
