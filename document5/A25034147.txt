ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral hearing has been manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level I in the right ear and no worse than Level I in the left ear.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1980 to June 1984.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a November 2023 decision.  In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 decision.  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an initial compensable rating for his bilateral hearing loss.  After careful consideration, the Board must respectfully disagree.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several Diagnostic Codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Ratings for hearing loss are determined in accordance with the findings obtained during audiometric examinations without the use of hearing aids.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  Generally, ratings for hearing impairment range from zero percent to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by the results of a controlled speech discrimination test, coupled with the average hearing threshold level as measured by a pure tone audiometry test in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz.  Id. 

To evaluate the degree of compensable disability from hearing impairment, the rating schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity levels designated from Level I, for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness.  See id.  The results of testing are charted on Table VI and Table VII to produce a compensable percentage rating from zero to 100 percent.  Id. 

If the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, or if the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, then the degree of disability will be evaluated as an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment using Table VI or Table VIA.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

By way of background, in a November 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was initially granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss and assigned a 0 percent rating, effective December 10, 2020, under Diagnostic Code 6100.  The Veteran appealed that decision in an April 2024 VA Form 10182.   Therefore, the relevant rating period begins on December 10, 2020, which is based on the effective date of the initial rating.  Accordingly, the Board has reviewed all relevant evidence, to include evidence received by November 2023.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3).

To assess the current degree of his hearing disability, the Veteran was afforded VA examinations in January 2022, May 2023, and October 2023.  As demonstrated below, these examinations did not produce audiometric results that warrant a compensable rating.

The audiometry test results were:

January 2022	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	30	40	35	32.50	100%

LEFT	25	40	50	65	45.00	96%

The examiner wrote that the Veteran "can't understand when more than one person is speaking at a time or when in a background of noise."

Under Table VI, the right ear hearing acuity was manifested by a Level I impairment, and the left ear by a Level I impairment.  Because the Veteran does not have an exceptional pattern of hearing loss, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 does not apply.

May 2023	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	35	45	40	36.25	100

LEFT	25	45	55	70	48.75	100

The examiner wrote that the "Veteran reports difficulty hearing in places with background noise, high ceilings, and concrete wall; i.e. church and conferences.  Veteran reports that he has hearing aids and wear them often.  Veteran reports that if someone turns their head he has difficulty hearing."

Under Table VI, the right ear hearing acuity was manifested by a Level I impairment, and the left ear by a Level I impairment.  Because the Veteran does not have an exceptional pattern of hearing loss, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 does not apply.

November 2023	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	30	35	55	50	42.5	100

LEFT	35	55	70	65	56.25	100

Under Table VI, the right ear hearing acuity was manifested by a Level I impairment, and the left ear by a Level I impairment.  Because the Veteran does not have an exceptional pattern of hearing loss, 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 does not apply.

While the Veteran is competent to report experiencing decreased hearing acuity, he is not competent to determine whether his symptoms warrant a specific rating under the Rating Schedule.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 467-69 (1994).  As above, the Rating Schedule for evaluating a hearing impairment requires specific findings from an appropriate audiological examination.

As such, the Board assigns significant probative weight to the VA audiological examinations for evaluating the severity of the Veteran's hearing loss in both ears.  That said, the Board does not discount the Veteran's assertions regarding his hearing disability.  The Board finds that the Veteran's descriptions of his experiences are credible and does not doubt that hearing loss impacts his daily interactions.  The Board finds, however, that the Veteran is not competent to identify a specific level of disability for compensation purposes according to the legally mandated Rating Schedule.

Instead, the three VA examinations provided competent and probative evidence showing that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss has manifested by no worse than a Level I hearing impairment for the right ear and a Level I hearing impairment for the left ear throughout the period on appeal.

Accordingly, the record evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.).
