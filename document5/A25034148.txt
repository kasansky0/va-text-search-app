ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right leg disability, manifesting as lower right extremity pain causing impairment in earning capacity (right leg disability) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's right leg disability had its onset in service.

2. The evidence of record is at least evenly balanced as to whether bilateral hearing has its onset it service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for right leg disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1976 to October 1996, including combat service for which he received the Air Medal with combat distinguishing "V" device.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision and a November 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the April 2024 decision, the AOJ denied service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Board has recharacterized this matter for the reasons stated below in light of the evidence developed during the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-5 (2009) (a claim should not be limited to the disorder as characterized by the Veteran but must be characterized and addressed based on the reasonable expectations of the non-expert claimant and the evidence in processing the claim).  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 and November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As the Board is granting the benefit sought in full, it need not consider whether the period to switch dockets has expired.  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that a March 2024 rating decision deferred issuing a decision for right leg disability until an examination and opinion could be obtained. However, while the Veteran was scheduled for a new examination and opinion in a March 2023, examination request, he did not report for the examination. There is no evidence or argument that the Veteran was not notified of the examination at the proper address or that he had good cause for not attending.  However, as entitlement can be established without examination under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a) (applicable when entitlement cannot be established without examination or reexamination), the Board need not consider 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

General Legal Principles 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right leg disability is granted.

In a November 2023 private treatment letter, the Veteran's private physician noted the Veteran's report of low back pain that includes a sharp pain that goes up his right side following a hard landing while flying. Further, the pain has been present for the last thirty years.

Although the evidence of record does not include a formal diagnosis of particular right leg disorder, pain alone is sufficient in some circumstances to show the existence of a current right leg disability. See Saunders, 886 F. 3d at 1364-65 (pain need not be diagnosed as connected to a current underlying condition to function as an impairment and pain alone can be considered a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110). In this case, the significant discomfort noted by the private physician and the other evidence of record including statements during the November 2023 VA Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflected that the Veteran's right leg pain causes impairment in earning capacity. Therefore, the current disability requirement has been met.

In a November 2023 DBQ the Veteran reported in 1982 during service he was in a hard landing. The Veteran immediately experienced acute low back pain. The pain has progressed since that time and is now a daily occurrence with, as noted in the November 2023 private treatment record, sharp pain on the right side. The in- service injury requirement has thus been met.

The remaining issue is thus whether there is a relationship between the current right leg disability and the in-service injury including to the right leg.

As noted above, in a November 2023 private medical record, the Veteran indicated that for the past thirty years he has had low back pain including a sharp pain that travels through his right side. 

The Veteran has competently indicated that the discernable symptoms of pain in his right leg have been ongoing from the injuries in service through the present day. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observable symptoms); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence). The Board finds that this lay evidence is credible and there is nothing in the evidence of record which contradicts the Veteran's plausible lay account of the in-service incurrence and the ongoing symptoms of his right leg pain. The November 2023 VA examiner did not render an etiological opinion as to the right leg because of the lack of diagnosis but as shown above that was based on an improper inference based on lack of current disability due to no diagnosis.

While the Board could remand for an opinion on the right leg disability, which address the credible lay evidence, remanding for an opinion could well be construed as an impermissible attempt to develop evidence with the exclusive intent of denying the Veteran's service connection claims, especially in light of the Veteran's competent, plausible, internally consistent, and credible accounts of the onset and ongoing symptomatology of his right leg disability, manifesting as pain. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").

To the extent that this grant of service connection is based upon credible lay evidence rather than complete medical opinions, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself." Buchanan, 451 F. 3d at 1377. This is particularly true given the Veteran's status as a combat veteran, as shown by his receipt of the Air Medal with combat distinguishing "V" device.  Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d at 998 (Congress enacted 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b) because of its concern that combat veterans faced "major obstacles" when seeking to assemble the medical records necessary to establish that they suffered an injury or disease while in service, given that medical records often do not survive combat conditions and due to the exigencies of battle, soldiers may not immediately seek medical treatment for combat-related injuries). Here, the Veteran has a right leg disability manifesting as pain in the lower right side and has provided competent lay evidence and medical treatment records showing that the symptoms began during his service, following a hard landing likely during combat, and have continued to the present.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is sufficient to decide the Veteran's right leg disability claim, as it is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's right leg disability, manifesting as pain, had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for the right leg disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where a chronic disease is shown in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.  Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies only when the disability for which the Veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, as organic diseases of the nervous system, are chronic diseases.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-272 (2015) (bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are within the category of organic diseases of the nervous system for which presumptive service connection is provided under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a)).

Hearing loss for the purposes of VA disability compensation is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when the speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The Court in Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993), indicated that 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a relationship between the Veteran's service and his present disability.  The Court's directives in Hensley are consistent with 38 C.F.R. §3.303(d), which provides that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.

On the October 2023 VA audiological examination, audiometric testing revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	10	25	20	30	35

LEFT	10	25	30	55	60

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 84 percent in the right ear and 80 percent in the left ear. These audiometric and speech recognition scores meet the current disability requirement for bilateral hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 as the Veteran's speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent and he had two thresholds above 40 in the left ear.

VA has conceded and favorably found acoustic trauma ("high probability" of excessive noise exposure) based upon the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Helicopter Repairer. The Veteran is competent to report that he experienced decreased hearing during active-duty service and continually thereafter. The Veteran reported during his October 2023 VA examination that he was exposed to tanks, helicopters, gunfire, explosions, grenades, military vehicles (including trucks), APU's, AGE, and generators during military service, that he did not have noise exposure since service, and he continued to experience decreased hearing after service. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observable symptoms).  He did so on the October 2023 VA examination and his statements in this regard are competent, credible, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).  The in-service injury requirement has thus been met.

The audiologist who conducted the October 2023 found VA examination found that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is the result of his time in service. In coming to his opinion, the audiologist noted that the Veteran's entrance examination and subsequent separation examination revealed normal hearing acuity across all frequencies. The audiologist based his negative opinion on normal hearing at separation and the lack of a threshold shift.  

For the following reasons service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.

The October 2023 audiologist found that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was due to his time in service. The audiologist based his negative nexus opinion in part on the fact that there was normal hearing at separation.  However, normal hearing upon separation is not necessarily fatal to a claim for service connection for a hearing loss disability. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). Thus, the audiologist's opinion is inadequate as it failed to consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding his hearing loss, chiefly his hazardous level of exposure while serving as a Helicopter Repairer and decreased hearing in and since service. This rendered the opinion inadequate.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d at 1337 (a VA's examiner's opinion, which relied on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence, "failed to consider whether the lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of [the veteran's] disability such that his claim for service connection could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence").  The opinion is therefore of no probative value.

To the extent that the grant of service connection for hearing loss is based upon the plausible, consistent, and credible lay evidence, "[n]othing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] requires both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself". Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.

Thus, though the Board could remand this claim for another medical opinion due to a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to provide an adequate medical opinion, there is sufficient evidence to decide the claim, and a remand could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying a claim, which is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"); Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 216, 225 (2021) ("Remand is inappropriate where the predominant purpose is not to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision unencumbered by error but to allow VA to obtain more evidence so that it can properly deny the claim").

For the reasons above, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
