ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is?dismissed.?? 

FINDING OF FACT

In April 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew?from appeal the claim of service connection for migraine headaches. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the Veteran's appeal of the claim of service connection for migraine headaches are met.? 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.?? 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1975 to July 1983. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2021 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) that, after a December 2020 Supplemental Claim, confirmed and continued the previous denial of the claim of service connection for migraine headaches. 

The Veteran timely appealed this matter in a July 2021 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182).?? 

Withdrawal and dismissal of the appeal?? 

"The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees."? 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).? An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal, and withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or his representative.? 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(a).?? 

In the present case, in April 2025, the Veteran, through his representative, submitted a Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138) to the Board indicating that he wished to cancel his Board hearing and withdraw all issues on appeal in the matter under docket number 210712-171584.  This is the docket number assigned to the claim of service connection for migraine headaches on appeal here, as indicated in the headers of this decision.  The April 2025 statement therefore constitutes a valid withdrawal of the appeal as it complied with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1)?and?(2) by including the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number,?and?a statement that the appeal was withdrawn.  Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 8 (2020).?

?

As the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal, there remains no specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  Accordingly,?dismissal?of the appeal is warranted.
