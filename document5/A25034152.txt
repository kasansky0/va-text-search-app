ORDER

Service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record does not competently and credibly establish that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his military service.

2. The Veteran's death certificate reflects that he died in November 2016 as a result of small cell lung cancer. 

3. A disability of service origin did not cause or contribute to the Veteran's death. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.312. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1971 to September 1973. He died in November 2016. The appellant is his widow. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

The appellant testified before the undersigned at a Board hearing held in January 2024. A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the record. 

Service Connection - Cause of Death

The appellant asserts that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Korea, and that his fatal lung cancer developed as a result, warranting service connection. 

Service connection for the cause of a veteran's death may be granted if a disability incurred in or aggravated by service was either the principal or contributory cause of the veteran's death. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.312(a). For a service-connected disability to be the principal cause of death, it must singly or jointly with some other condition be the immediate or underlying cause of death or be etiologically related thereto. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).

Minor service-connected disabilities, particularly those of a static nature, or not materially affecting a vital organ, would not be held to have contributed to death primarily due to unrelated disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(2). There are primary causes of death, which by their very nature are so overwhelming that eventual death can be anticipated irrespective of coexisting conditions, but, even in such cases, there is for consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material influence in accelerating death. In this situation, however, it would not generally be reasonable to hold that a service-connected condition accelerated death unless such condition affected a vital organ and was of itself a progressive or debilitating nature. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(4).

The Veteran's death certificate reflects that he died in November 2016 as a result of small cell lung cancer. At the time of his death, service connection was not in effect for any disabilities. However, the appellant contends that a contributing cause of his death, namely his lung cancer, is due to alleged in-service exposure to herbicide agents. In this regard, she does not allege, and the record does not show, that a principal or contributory cause of the Veteran's death is otherwise directly or presumptively related to his military service. See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (2008) (claims which have no support in the record need not be considered by the Board as the Board is not obligated to considered "all possible" substantive theories of recovery. Where a fully developed record is presented to the Board with no evidentiary support for a particular theory of recovery, there is no reason for the Board to address or consider such a theory). Rather, the appellant contends that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents coincident with his service in the Republic of Korea from December 1971 to November 1972. 

The law provides a presumption of service connection for certain diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents, and that become manifest within a specified time period, even if there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of service. For purposes of the presumption, "herbicide agents" are 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and its contaminant TCDD, cacodylic acid, and picloram. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(i). Veterans who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in one of the units designated by the Department of Defense as having served in or near the Korean DMZ between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, are presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). 

For those veterans who have been exposed to herbicide agents, certain diseases are acknowledged to be presumptively related to such exposure if such manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a specified time period. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § § 3.309(e). Relevant here, the diseases presumed to be associated with herbicide exposure include respiratory cancers, or cancers of the lung, bronchus, larynx, or trachea.

A review of the Veteran's service personnel records reflect that he served on the ground in the Republic of Korea from December 1971 to November 1972. The record is not clear as to whether his unit, the 2nd Administrative Company, operated in or near the Korean DMZ. The units of the 2nd Infantry Division designated by the Department of Defense as those that operated during the qualifying period in or near the Korean DMZ were 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 9th Infantry, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 17th Infantry, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the 23rd Infantry, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 31st Infantry, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the 32nd Infantry, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 38th Infantry, 4th Battalion of the 7th Cavalry, 2nd Battalion of the 10th Cavalry, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 72nd Armor, 1st Battalion of the 12th Artillery, 1st Battalion of the 15th Artillery, 7th Battalion of the 17th Artillery, 6th Battalion of the 37th Artillery, and 5th Battalion of the 38th Artillery. Again, the record is not clear as to which battalion encompassed the 2nd Administrative Company, and the Veteran's military personnel records are silent on the matter.

However, even assuming arguendo that the Veteran served in a unit that had operated in or near the DMZ, his lung cancer does not qualify for presumptive service connection under § 3.307(a)(6)(iv). In conjunction with providing information about the units that operated in or near the DMZ from April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, the Department of Defense has determined that no exposure to tactical herbicide agents occurred during the periods, or in locations, other than those reflected in § 3.307(a)(6)(iv). 

As noted supra, the Veteran began serving in Korea in December 1971, which the Board notes is after the August 31, 1971 cutoff date. The appellant has consistently expressed her belief that, due to the short period between the cutoff date and the Veteran's service, the Veteran was nonetheless exposed to residual Agent Orange that had been previously sprayed. 

In support of this theory, she submitted two letters from Dr. I.J.P, the Veteran's oncologist. In a June 2021 letter, Dr. I.J.P. asserted that it was as likely as not that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Korea. In support of this conclusion, he explained that soon after the Veteran left Korea, the appellant became pregnant by him but miscarried. Then, she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a daughter who was born with a variety of physical birth defects. In addition, Dr. I.J.P. explained, the Veteran later developed diabetes mellitus, which "has a known, well-acknowledged connection to Agent Orange exposure." Dr. I.J.P. asserted that the Veteran's lung cancer developed as a result of this exposure to herbicide agents. 

At the January 2024 hearing, the appellant submitted an updated version of the June 2021 letter, in which Dr. I.J.P. included references to a study that showed that herbicides sprayed in Korea and Vietnam had been shown to remain in the soil for periods long after active spraying ceased. Therefore, based on his knowledge and review of the medical and factual history of the Veteran's case, it was his opinion that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Korea in December 1971, and that exposure caused him to subsequently develop lung cancer. 

Based on this evidence, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's lung cancer cannot be granted. The evidence of record simply does not competently and credibly establish that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his military service. He was stationed in Korea outside the recognized time period during which herbicides were known to have been applied, and therefore, exposure to herbicide agents cannot be conceded. The Board notes that while the appellant and Dr. I.J.P. have contended that there were residual chemicals present after August 31, 1971 in or near the Korean DMZ, the regulations which set forth the recognized time period for which herbicides were known to have been applied in Korea were prescribed by Congress, and the Board is not free to disregard them. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101 (a). Regardless of the equities of the Veteran's situation, the Board can only allow benefits that are explicitly authorized. See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992). 

Crucially, the regulation providing for presumptive exposure for veterans who served in or near the Korea DMZ specifically accounts for the possibility of residual exposure for years after the spraying ceased. Indeed, in its proposed rule published in July 2009, VA explained that the Department of Defense determined that the time period when herbicides were applied near the DMZ was between April 1968 and July 1969. See 74 Fed. Reg. 36,640. Therefore, in the final rule published in January 2011, VA extended the presumed exposure period to August 31, 1971, two years after herbicide spraying had ceased, to account for potential risk of exposure to residuals of herbicide previously applied in that area. See 76 Federal Register 4245 (January 25, 2011); 149 Cong. Rec. H11705-01 (2003) (noting that in order to account for residual exposure "it is appropriate to extend the qualifying service period beyond 1969 to account for residual exposure"), see also 149 Cong. Rec. S15133-01 (2003). Thus, it is clear that the Veteran served in Korea many years after the cessation of the application of herbicide agents, and was not actually exposed to such. 

As for Dr. I.J.P.'s June 2021 and December 2024 letters, the Board can only afford them minimal probative weight on the question of nexus. Specifically, it finds that the letters are based entirely on an inaccurate fact pattern; namely, that the Veteran was exposed to Agent Orange. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (concluding that a medical opinion is only as good and credible as the history on which it was based, and if based on an inaccurate factual premise it has no probative value); see also Samuels v. West, 11 Vet. App. 433 (1998) (VA is not required to accept statements or testimony that is inherently incredible). Further, Dr. I.J.P.'s attempts to show that the Veteran's post-service health issues are proof of in-service herbicide agent exposure are speculative, at best, and outweighed by the evidence of record which shows that the Veteran was, in fact, never exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Korea. See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993) (medical evidence that is speculative, general or inconclusive in nature cannot support a claim).

Therefore, as the probative evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his military service, there is no duty on the part of VA to obtain a medical opinion addressing whether his lung cancer was related to such alleged exposure, as there is no reasonable possibility that such development would assist the appellant in substantiating her claim. DeLaRosa v. Peake, 515 F.3d 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Consequently, the Board finds that a disability of service origin did not cause or contribute to the Veteran's death. Therefore, service connection for the cause of his death is not warranted.

In so finding, the Board acknowledges the appellant's sincere and long-held belief that not only did the Veteran's fatal cancer develop due to herbicide exposure in Korea, but also that her daughter's ongoing medical issues related to her birth defects are a result of such. The Board sympathizes with the appellant. It appreciates the Veteran's honorable service, and genuinely wishes it could reach a more favorable outcome in this matter. However, VA cannot pay a benefit that has not been authorized by Congress, and the law regarding this claim is dispositive. See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992), citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990) ("No equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress."); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

In reaching its decision herein, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the evidence is persuasively against the appellant's claim of entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, and that doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). For the reasons set forth above, the claim is denied.
