ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 30 percent rating for service-connected irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 20 percent rating for service-connected radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 20 percent rating for service-connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has been continuously prosecuting the claims on appeal for IBS and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy ever since November 2, 2018, through the original Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision denying service connection on May 9, 2019, that Notice of Disagreement received on May 9, 2020, a January 29, 2024 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) adjudication granting the claims for service connection, the resulting January 31, 2024 rating decision implementing initial ratings effective November 2, 2018, updated VA examinations conducted on February 13, 2024, a March 27, 2024 rating decision (awarding increases to current rating stages effective February 13, 2024, but continuing the previous initial rating stages from November 2, 2018 to prior to February 13, 2024), and the July 16, 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision on appeal.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's IBS has at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) manifested in the current level of severity throughout the appellate period (effective November 2, 2018, and not merely effective February 13, 2024), resulting in abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months, frequent changes in stool form, and subjective distention.

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's radiculopathy of the left lower extremity radiculopathy of the left lower extremity has at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) manifested in the current level of severity throughout the appellate period (effective November 2, 2018, and not merely effective February 13, 2024), resulting in moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

4. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's radiculopathy of the right lower extremity has at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) manifested in the current level of severity throughout the appellate period (effective November 2, 2018, and not merely effective February 13, 2024), resulting in moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 30 percent rating for service-connected irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7319; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

The criteria for Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 20 percent rating for service-connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1996 to April 2005.  These claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a March 27, 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which was later subjected to Higher-Level Review (HLR).  The HLR rating decision was issued on July 16, 2024.

In the July 23, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 27, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As noted, the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a NOD to change the Board docket being requested. The time limit for such modification is "within one year from the date that the [AOJ] mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the [NOD], whichever is later." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  "[T]he Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  As a result of Williams, supra, the Board could normally be precluded from adjudicating this claim until July 16, 2025 at the earliest, allowing for one year after the rating decision on appeal and 60 days after receipt of the NOD to file a new one.  Ultimately, the Board determines that the Veteran's claims can be granted in full, so there is no prejudice in adjudicating it now, notwithstanding any provision in Williams, supra.

A claimant may "limit a claim or appeal to the issue of entitlement to a particular disability rating which is less than the maximum disability rating allowed by law" via "clearly expressed intent to limit the appeal to entitlement to a specific disability rating for the service-connected condition." See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (citing Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 544 (1993)).  The Veteran's NOD clearly states that she and her attorney are seeking the following, from the July 17, 2024 rating decision: "1. Left Leg Radiculopathy - Seeking 20% from 11/02/2018.  2. Right Leg Radiculopathy - Seeking 20% from 11/02/2018.  3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - Seeking 30% from 11/02/2018.  Please reference all evidence submitted with 10182 evidence lane 5/9/2020.  Please note, this is being continuously prosecuted."  The Board limits jurisdiction accordingly, and the Board concludes that a full grant of all sought benefits is warranted.

In so granting maximum benefits, the Board could interpret the claims as either (a) ones for earlier effective dates for all three current rating stages to be set at the initial date of November 2, 2018, instead of the most recent VA examination date of February 13, 2024, or else (b) ones for claims for increased ratings of the initial stages (10 percent each, effective from November 2, 2018 until prior to February 13, 2014), so that the initial ratings match the current ratings in effect thereafter, and then concluding that the Veteran has no further claims thereafter effective February 13, 2024, because those benefits are already in effect.  The ultimate results (of IBS being rated 30 percent disabling effective November 2, 2018, and each radiculopathy in each lower extremity being rated 20 percent disabling effective November 2, 2018), would be the same either way.  

The Board also notes in passing that only for the claim for the right lower extremity radiculopathy, the AOJ appears to have improperly reduced the initial rating from 20 percent to 10 percent, for the portion of the period from November 2, 2018 to prior to February 13, 2024.  Once again, there is no difference in the ultimate outcome, because the Board can award the benefits which the Veteran seeks-whether by reversing the reduction, adjusting the effective date of the 20 percent rating stage, or increasing the initial rating stage to 20 percent. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

If the Board were to interpret this as a claim for increased ratings, then the Board would normally have to consider whether a claim for a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) could be inferred from the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Rice does not apply in this instance.  Even though the Veteran's back disorder (not otherwise on appeal but rated 40 percent disabling effective November 2, 2018) and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy might combine as one disability rated 60 percent disabling throughout the appellate period, there is no competent or credible evidence that the Veteran is unemployed.  In fact, in a February 18, 2020 VA treatment record, a treating VA podiatrist noted that "She works [sic, present tense] as admin job (desk)." See VA Medical Record (Feb. 18, 2020, rec'd May 17, 2023), at Page 8.  Similarly, at a VA examination, an examiner stated that "The Veteran has difficulty staying on schedule or attending events due to frequently having to use the bathroom.  The Veteran experiences abdominal pain that limits her from doing any activity." See C&P Exam (Feb. 13, 2024), at Question No. 10.  The examiner did not indicate that employment was abandoned or precluded.  

Current employment precludes any award of TDIU, so the Board sees no error in not adjudicating a claim not before the Board.  Finally, the Board is limiting the claims on appeal as they are specifically listed on the NOD, and the NOD does not preserve any appeal for TDIU, if the claim were ever before the Board.  The Veteran is free to file a supplemental claim for TDIU if she should actually become unemployable due to service-connected disorders. 

Earlier Effective Dates

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  All three disabilities on appeal now have been service connected effective November 2, 2018, all rated 10 percent disabling thereafter until prior to February 13, 2024, and then all three disabilities have been at their current ratings effective February 13, 2024.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed the Veteran's and her attorney's arguments, along with the competent and credible evidence of record.  In sum and substance, the Veteran filed claims for service connection, and claims were denied in aa May 9, 2019 rating decision.  While the Veteran was pursuing claims for service connection, she submitted examination reports and positive etiological opinions from her chosen physician. See generally Correspondence (rec'd July 22, 2020).  Claims for service connection were granted in the January 29, 2024 Board decision, and the January 31, 2024 rating decision (implementing initial ratings) states the following for each of these three claims on appeal: "*Please note: We are ordering an examination to properly evaluate your condition. (38 CFR 3.159, 38 CFR 3.326)." See generally Rating Decision (Jan. 31, 2024).

After the Board granted service connection and after the AOJ determined that examinations were required to properly evaluate the conditions on appeal, those examinations were conducted on February 13, 2024.  In the March 27, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ accepted the results from the February 2024 examinations and assigned staged rating increases at current levels effective then.  Even though the AOJ stated that they needed examinations for proper evaluations, they continued the previous 10 percent initial ratings.  The Veteran and her attorney argue that the disabilities have been at the respective February 2024 severities ever since November 2, 2018.  The evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to support this argument, so the Board will accept the argument.

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation on an original claim for compensation will be the day following separation from?active duty?service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.??38?U.S.C. §?5110(a)-(b)(1);?38?C.F.R. §?3.400(b)(2).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has explained that, in an original claim for service connection, the date entitlement arises is governed by the date the claim is received, not the date of the medical evidence submitted to support a particular claim.??See McGrath v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?28 (2000).  Where a prior?unappealed?decision becomes final and binding on a Veteran, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of a reopened claim, not the date of receipt of the original claim.? Sears v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?244 (2002);?Melton v. West, 13?Vet. App.?442 (2000). 

Under VA laws and regulations, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA must be filed?in order for?benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under laws administered by the VA.??38?U.S.C. §?5101(a);?38?C.F.R. §?3.151(a).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by the VA, and identifying the benefits sought, may be considered an informal claim.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a). 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The Veteran limited the scope of this appeal to assigning November 2, 2018 as the effective date of all three current staged ratings, instead of February 13, 2024.  November 2, 2018 is a date after March 24, 2015. The standard forms amendments must apply.

The provisions of?38?U.S.C. §?5101(a) mandate that a claim must be filed?in order for?any type of benefit to accrue or be paid.??See?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998).? Further, the mere presence of medical evidence in the record does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for the benefit in question.??Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-5 (1998).? While the Board must interpret the Veteran's submissions broadly, the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the Veteran.? Id.? 

The word "claim" includes a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a?benefit.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-35 (1998);?Servello v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?196, 199 (1992).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a Veteran may?be considered to be?an informal claim.? Such an informal claim must identify the benefits sought.? Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.??38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a).? To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.??See?Quarles v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?129, 134 (1992). 

From March 25, 2015 forward, a claim for benefits must be filed on the standardized claim form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151. A veteran may also indicate their intent to file a claim for compensation by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA must provide the claimant with the appropriate claims form.  Id.  If a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary is received by VA within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the formal claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id.    

In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.?38?C.F.R. §?3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in?38?C.F.R. §?3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(b). 

In this regard, VA may not pay a benefit before a claim is made.??38?U.S.C. §?5101;?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that "[38 U.S.C.A. §] 5101 is a clause of general applicability and mandates that a claim must be filed in order for any type of benefits to... be paid under the laws administered by the Secretary.")? The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability.?Lalonde v. West, 12?Vet. App.?377, 382 (1999);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 35 (1998).? More specifically, a medical examination report is only considered an informal claim for an increase in disability benefits if service connection has already been established for the disability.??MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006);?see also?38?C.F.R. §?3.157(b)(1) (medical records can serve as informal claim "when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established").? Likewise, the mere presence of a disability does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service?connection for that condition.??Crawford v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?33, 35 (1995);?KL v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?205, 208 (1993).

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Walker v. Shinseki, 701 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence of record is persuasive for or against the claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is instead adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Although the Board must provide adequate reasons and bases for a decision, the Board need not discuss all evidence of record.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on what the relevant evidence shows, or fails to show, with respect to the Veteran's claims on appeal. Consequently, any evidence not discussed within this decision is irrelevant, duplicative, or unfavorable to the Veteran's claims.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

While the Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination, where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is a present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  The Court has held that, in determining the present level of a disability for any increased evaluation claim, the Board must consider the application of staged ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  In other words, where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings would be necessary.

Consideration is given to the potential application of the various provisions of 38 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 4, whether or not they are raised by the Veteran, as required by Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Generally, separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994). The Court has also held that within a particular diagnostic code, a claimant is not entitled to more than one disability rating for a single disability unless the regulation expressly provides otherwise. Cullen v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 74 (2010). 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 30 percent rating for service-connected irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is granted.

38 C.F.R. § 4.114 delineates a schedule of ratings for disorders of the digestive system.  The Veteran's IBS is rated under Diagnostic Code 7319.  These rating criteria provide for a maximum 30 percent rating for abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  A 20 percent rating is awarded for abdominal pain related to defecation for at least three days per month during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  A 10 percent rating is awarded for abdominal pain related to defecation at least once during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  When the claim for service connection was initially adjudicated, the AOJ did not identify the Veteran's current diagnosis of IBS. See Rating Decision (May 9, 2019), at Page 8 of 11, Section No. 13.  The diagnosis is clearly of record now, because it is service connected effective November 2, 2018, and rated at its current severity effective February 13, 2024.  The Board is bound by that finding.  

The Veteran supplied an examination report from a Dr. E.B., who confirmed that the Veteran's IBS manifests in diarrhea, abdominal pain, frequent changes in stool consistency, and distension. See DBQ (June 2, 2020, rec'd July 22, 2020), at Section III.  The Veteran also complained of "more or less constant abdominal distress," with four bowel movements per day or more with accompanying abdominal pain, "experiencing these exacerbations [twice or thrice] per month." Id. at Section IV.  Meanwhile, the Veteran told the February 2024 examiner that symptoms have remained the same, and the examiner concluded that there was no worsening or change of diagnosis. See C&P Exam (Feb. 13, 2024), at Page 2, Question No. 2A; id. at Page 7, Section XI, Additional Question No. 1.  If the Board accepts the conclusion that symptoms have been the same throughout the appellate period, then the Veteran should be entitled to the current 30 percent rating effective November 2, 2018, and not merely effective February 13, 2024, which just happens to be when the Veteran submitted to an examination. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); AB v. Brown, supra.

The Board has also considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) is appropriate for the Veteran's IBS; however, the Board finds that her symptomatology was stable throughout the period on appeal. More specifically, from November 2, 2018 to the present, the Veteran's IBS has been stable, and always most closely approximating the maximum 30 percent rating instead of any other rating.  

Ultimately, the Veteran limited this claim as one for a 30 percent initial rating, and the Board can grant that exact benefit now.  Therefore, assigning a staged rating for such disability is either not possible, not warranted, or simply not the most advantageous result for this Veteran.  

Finally, neither the Veteran nor her attorney have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the claim adjudicated herein.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for increased initial rating is GRANTED to the extent of a 30 percent rating for IBS throughout the appellate period as effective November 2, 2018, and the Board concludes that this is a full grant of maximum benefits available to the Veteran, due to the limits of her claim that she clearly articulated to the Board.  There is no further doubt to resolve. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 20 percent rating for service-connected radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is granted.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of November 2, 2018, but no earlier, for the current 20 percent rating for service-connected radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is granted.

38 C.F.R. § 4.124a delineates a schedule of ratings for neurological conditions and convulsive disorders.  The Veteran's radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities is a peripheral nerve disease, and hers is specifically rated under Diagnostic Code 8520.  The initial 10 percent rating is given for mild incomplete paralysis, and the current 20 percent rating (previously effective February 13, 2024, but never before earlier than that) is given for moderate incomplete paralysis.  As the Veteran has limited her claim to one for an initial 20 percent rating effective November 2, 2018, ratings in excess of 20 percent are not pertinent.

When the Veteran was pursuing claims for service connection for her back disorder, she submitted to a January 29, 2019 VA examination. See C&P Exam (Jan. 29, 2019).  The examiner concluded that even though intermittent pain in the right lower extremity was moderate, all other symptoms were mild. See id. at Page 6, Question No. 8 et seq.  The Veteran then supplied an examination report from a Dr. E.B., who determined that the radiculopathy manifested in moderate (not just "mild") symptoms. See DBQ (June 2, 2020, rec'd July 22, 2020), at Pages 7-8, Section XIII, Question No. 13 et seq.  These reports were of record as of the January 31, 2024 rating decision, which is when the AOJ first attempted to assign initial ratings.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, a 20 percent rating is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) warranted effective November 2, 2018, because the Board has no reason to impugn the adequacy of Dr. E.B.'s findings, and that examination is report is at least evenly balanced with the January 2019 VA examination report. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  

Effective February 13, 2024, the Veteran has already been awarded the benefit otherwise being sought on appeal (here, the current 20 percent rating), so that portion of the claim is dismissed as moot. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).  Meanwhile, and as already stated, the grant of an initial 20 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy effective November 2, 2018 is a full grant of the benefits that the Veteran and her attorney are seeking on appeal. See Hamilton, supra; AB, supra.

The Board has also considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) is appropriate for the Veteran's radiculopathies; however, the Board finds that her symptomatology was stable throughout the period on appeal. More specifically, from November 2, 2018 to the present, the Veteran's radiculopathies have been stable, and always most closely approximating the maximum 20 percent rating instead of any other rating.  In the event that the radiculopathies have progressed in severity, the Board determines that it is possible for a radiculopathy rated 20 percent to become more painful, but still not entitled to any higher rating.  Alternatively, and if for no other reason, the Board concludes that the Veteran's claim is being granted in full, so there is simply nothing left to adjudicate, because everything is to be adjudicated in the Veteran's favor, subject to her limited claims.  

Ultimately, the Veteran limited these claims as for a 20 percent initial rating bilaterally, and the Board can grant that exact benefit now.  Therefore, assigning a staged rating for such disability is either not possible, not warranted, or simply not the most advantageous result for this Veteran.  Finally, neither the Veteran nor her attorney have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the claim adjudicated herein.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for increased initial ratings is GRANTED to the extent of a 20 percent rating for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities throughout the appellate period as effective November 2, 2018, and the Board concludes that this is a full grant of maximum benefits available to the Veteran, due to the limits of her claim that she clearly articulated to the Board.
