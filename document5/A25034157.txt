DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of November 17, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a left knee strain, is granted.

An effective date of November 17, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a right knee strain, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's proper effective date for the grant of service connection for his bilateral knee strain is November 17, 2022, the day after he left active-duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 6, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a left knee strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 6, 2023, for the grant of service connection for a right knee strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2017 to November 2022.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2024 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Effective Dates

In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In claims for direct service connection, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service, the effective date of the award is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Otherwise, it is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For effective date purposes, a claim is a formal or informal written communication identifying and requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris, may be considered an informal claim. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year after the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c); Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for left knee strain 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for right knee strain 

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for a bilateral knee strain. 

Here, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date.  Specifically, he separated from service on November 16, 2022, and submitted an intent to file claim on September 6, 2023.  He properly followed his intent to file with a timely submitted formal claim on February 21, 2024.  As the Court in Norris made clear, an intent to file will be treated as a claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c) if a formal claim is submitted within a year after, and there is no reason to suggest that this interpretation would not be applied to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

As such, by filing an intent to file a claim within a year of separation that is followed by a formal claim in a timely manner, the effective date of the claim is the day following separation from service: November 17, 2022.  Indeed, the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) appears to agree with this interpretation.  See M21-1 Part V.ii.4.A.2.b (January 13, 2025).  Accordingly, the appeal is granted in full.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
