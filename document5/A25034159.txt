ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke is manifested by moderate incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher for left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8513.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2001 to February 2002, from March 2002 to March 2003 and from June 2005 to September 2005. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for her honorable service to our country.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran seeks a rating higher than 20 percent for left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke.

By way of background, the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for stroke residuals in April 2009.  See April 2009 Correspondence.  The Veteran's claim was originally denied in a January 2010 rating decision, but in response to the Veteran timely filing a notice of disagreement and the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for stroke residuals in a September 2011 rating decision.  See September 2011 Rating Decision.  Specifically, the Veteran was granted service connection for left upper extremity neurological impairment, status post right middle cerebral artery infarct (claimed as residuals of stroke to include cognitive decline), rated as 20 percent disabling effective April 1, 2009.  Id.

The Veteran timely filed a claim for an increased rating for her stroke residuals. See December 2011 Statement in Support of Claim; February 2012 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Veteran's claim for an increased rating was denied in a February 2012 rating decision.  See February 2012 Rating Decision.

No appeal, higher level review, or supplemental claim was filed within the year following this rating decision; no relevant records were associated with the file or within the constructive possession of VA.  Therefore, the February 2012 rating decision is final.

The Veteran next filed a claim for an increased rating for stroke residuals in a claim received by VA on December 5, 2022.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-526 EZ.  After receiving a new VA examination, the AOJ issued a decision denying the Veteran's claim for an increased rating, explaining that the Veteran's disability is rated as a left upper extremity neurological impairment, status post right middle cerebral artery infarct (nondominant) based on mild incomplete paralysis of the minor extremity (38 CFR 4.124a).  See January 2024 Rating Decision.  

The Veteran timely filed a request for higher level review of the January 2024 rating decision and received a new VA examination.  See January 2024 VA Form 20-0996.  While the Veteran's higher level review was pending the AOJ issued another rating decision in response to the Veteran's December 2022 filing, again denying the Veteran an increased rating.  See April 2024 Rating Decision.  

The AOJ then issued a rating decision responding to the Veteran's request for higher level review, which again denied the Veteran's claim for an increased rating.  See May 2024 Rating Decision.  The Veteran timely appealed that decision to the Board.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

The Board therefore finds the period on appeal stems from December 5, 2022, to include consideration of the one-year look back period, but no earlier.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

Disability ratings are determined by the applications of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during service and their residual conditions in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21; Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Paralysis of the radicular groups is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8513.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling for both the major and minor extremity.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent for the major extremity and 30 percent for the minor extremity.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 70 percent for the major extremity and 60 percent for the minor extremity.  Complete paralysis of the major extremity is rated as 90 percent for the major extremity and 80 percent for the minor extremity.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

There are several relevant medical records during the period on appeal, including that the Veteran has received two VA examinations during this period, in December 2023 and in April 2024.

The Veteran's November 2023 VA treatment records discuss comprehensive medical issues related to the Veteran's left side overall, but specific to her left upper extremity the records note that "there is decrease sensation to touch" at the Veteran's left arm.  See November 2023 VA Treatment Records.

The December 2023 VA examiner noted numerous, profoundly impactful symptoms of the Veteran's stroke residuals affecting issues ranging from cognition to memory to bowel and urinary impairments.  See December 2023 VA Examination.  However, as specifically regarding the Veteran's left upper extremity the examiner found that the Veteran's "left upper extremity muscle weakness" is "moderate."  Id.  The examiner also recorded the Veteran's pinch and grip strength on the left arm to be "3/5" compared to a "5/5" for "normal strength."  Id. 

The April 2024 VA examiner also more generally discussed the Veteran's comprehensive stroke residuals symptoms, with an emphasis on her service-connected depression which is rated as 100 percent disabling.  See April 2024 VA Examination.  However, as specifically regarding the Veteran's left upper extremity the examiner found that the Veteran's "left upper extremity muscle weakness" is "moderate."  Id.  The examiner recorded the Veteran's elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, wrist extension, and pinch and grip strength on the left arm to be "3/5" compared to a "5/5" for "normal strength."  Id. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the specific disability of left upper extremity neurological impairment is primarily manifest by muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and loss of sensation.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability is manifest by complete paralysis.  The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the competent medical evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran's left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke, manifested with symptoms and severity consistent with a 30 percent disability for the entire period on appeal, so since at least December 2022.  See generally Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015) (indicating that the effective date for an increased, initial, or staged rating is predicated on when the increase in the level of disability can be ascertained).  Thus, a 30 percent disability rating, but no higher, for left upper extremity weakness, residual of cryptogenic stroke, is hereby GRANTED for the entire period on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(a); 4.130, DC 8513.
