ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2021, but no earlier, for a 70 percent rating for major depressive disorder with anxious distress (MDD) is granted.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's MDD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

2. Throughout the appeal period, the weight of the probative evidence fails to demonstrate that the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability was manifested by flexion limited to 30 degrees or less; extension limited to 10 degrees or less; ankylosis; or recurrent subluxation or patellar instability.

3. Throughout the appeal period, the weight of the probative evidence fails to demonstrate that the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability was manifested by flexion limited to 30 degrees or less; extension limited to 10 degrees or less; ankylosis; or recurrent subluxation or patellar instability.

4. Throughout the appeal period, the weight of the probative evidence fails to demonstrate that the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral disability was manifested by forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasms or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. There is no intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 24, 2021, but no earlier, for a 70 percent rating for MDD are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9434.

2. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a service-connected left knee strain are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5260.

3. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a service-connected right knee strain are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5260.

4. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a service-connected lumbosacral disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 2017 to August 2021.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 higher-level review rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2021, but no earlier, for a 70 percent rating for MDD is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his service-connected MDD warrants a rating of 70 percent for the entire period from which service connection was first granted. See June 2023 VA Form 20-0996. The Veteran's MDD has been rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9434, and is currently rated at 30 percent from August 24, 2021, and at 70 percent from March 24, 2022.

By way of background, a VA notification letter reflects that the Veteran submitted an intent-to-file a claim for compensation on July 19, 2021. He separated from service on August 23, 2021. He then submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ for, among other things, MDD on September 7, 2021. He was granted service connection for MDD by rating decision dated November 2021. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 requesting review of the rating assigned for his MDD in March 2022. A July 2022 rating decision granted a 70 percent rating effective April 15, 2022, the date of the Veteran's most recent VA examination. The Veteran requested a higher level review of this decision in June 2023, asserting that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for his 70 percent rating. A September 2023 rating decision granted an earlier effective date of March 24, 2022, the date of the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995, for the Veteran's 70 percent rating for MDD. The Veteran appealed this decision in September 2024.

The law and regulations governing effective dates establish that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application therefore is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1). This statutory provision is implemented by a regulation which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2021. The examiner opined that the Veteran's MDD resulted in occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency, noting symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in April 2022. The examiner opined that the Veteran's MDD resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, noting symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, disturbances in motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran's MDD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas throughout the period on appeal. The Veteran reported suicidal ideation during his military service and was found to be an intermediate chronic risk for suicide in June 2021. See April 2021 STR - Medical at 45; June 2021 STR - Medical at 25. In May 2021, the Veteran was admitted for a psychiatric evaluation after endorsing suicidal ideation. See May 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 4. The Veteran most recently endorsed suicidal ideation in December 2021, asserting that these ideations recur monthly, and last for around a week. See December 2021 VA Form 21-4138. Additionally, in May 2021, the Veteran was treated for worsening panic attacks, and, on mental status examination, the Veteran's hygiene was noted to be "disheveled," with an "unkempt appearance." See May 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility at 6. In June 2021, the Veteran's treatment plan for MDD noted symptoms of poor impulse control, poor interpersonal skills, poor judgment, and vocational/occupational concerns. See June 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Governmental Facility at 62.

Under Diagnostic Code 9434, a 70 percent evaluation is warranted if the evidence establishes there is occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and/or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The Veteran has been treated for and has endorsed many of the symptoms contemplated under DC 9434 for a 70 percent evaluation in the year prior to filing his increased rating claim. In Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the presence of suicidal ideation alone might cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. In the Veteran's case, the totality of his acquired psychiatric disorder symptoms rose to the level of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas by April 2021, the earliest date of his reported suicidal ideation. 

Here, the Veteran filed an intent-to-file in July 2021-prior to his separation from service the following month-and then he filed an initial claim for MDD in September 2021. The AOJ assigned an initial 30 percent rating based on findings from the September 2021 VA examiner, assigning an effective date of the date following separation from service since the claim was filed within one year of separation from service. However, symptoms consistent with a 70 percent rating were shown in the months prior to his separation from service and filing of the claim. As this evidence is consistent with the findings in the April 2022 VA examination, the Board therefore finds that the Veteran's MDD has been manifested by occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas throughout the period on appeal. Accordingly, an earlier effective date for a 70 percent rating is granted for MDD from August 24, 2021.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

A veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 5 (1994). However, where the question for consideration is entitlement to a higher initial rating assigned following the grant of service connection, evaluation of the medical evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. In Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), the Court held that, although pain may cause a functional loss, "pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system." Rather, pain may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability "to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, or endurance." Id., quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

With respect to joints, in particular, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes. Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). 

The intent of the Rating Schedule is to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. In Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011), the Court found that, when 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record, even in non-arthritis contexts, the Board should address its applicability.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain is denied.

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a higher initial rating for his bilateral knee strain. See March 2022 VA Form 20-0995.

By way of background, a November 2021 rating decision awarded service connection for the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities, effective August 24, 2021, the date after his discharge from service. The AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating for both knees under DC 5261 for limitation of extension of 10 to 14 degrees. In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ adjusted their classification of the Veteran's knee disabilities, finding no limitation of extension under DC 5261, but instead assigning a 10 percent evaluation under DC 5260. In assigning a 10 percent disability rating, the AOJ considered the Veteran's painful motion in the knee and assigned the minimum compensable evaluation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. Pettiti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 425 (2015) (holding that § 4.59 serves as a bridge linking painful motion and limitation of motion, such that a claimant with painful motion is deemed to have limited motion under DC 5003 even though actual motion is not limited).

Under DC 5260, a 10 percent rating is assigned if flexion is limited to 45 degrees, a 20 percent rating is assigned if flexion is limited to 30 degrees, and the maximum 30 percent rating is assigned if flexion is limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260. Normal range of motion of the knee is up to 140 degrees flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II. 

Under DC 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 5 degrees, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 10 degrees, a 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 15 degrees, a 30 percent rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 20 degrees, a 40 percent rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 30 degrees, and a 50 percent rating is warranted for limitation of extension to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R.       § 4.71a, DC 5261.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the severity of his knee disabilities in September 2021. Regarding functional impairment, the Veteran noted his knee pain limited prolonged standing to two hours and walking to 45 minutes. See September 2021 C&P Exam at 10. Range of motion was to 140 degrees of flexion with pain and 0 degrees of extension with pain in the right knee, causing functional loss, and 140 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension with pain in the left knee, causing functional loss. The Veteran reported moderate to severe flare-ups of the right knee that last two to four days. The examination was not conducted during a flare-up. The examiner estimated that extension in the right knee would be reduced by 10 degrees during a flare-up. There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, ligament tear, or recurrent patellar instability. There was no identified meniscal condition, no indication of nonunion or malunion of the tibia and fibula, or shin splints.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in April 2022. Regarding functional impairment, the Veteran noted he has a "sandy" feeling in his right knee all the time, and that, if he sleeps on it wrong, he will "call out of work for multiple days due to inability to walk 'properly.'" The Veteran also noted that he is unable to work out, lift heavy items, or walk for prolonged periods. See April 2022 C&P Exam at 21. Range of motion was to 80 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension in the right knee, and 90 degrees of flexion and 0 degrees of extension in the left knee. The Veteran reported severe flare-ups of the right knee that last "days". The examination was not conducted during a flare-up. The examiner estimated that flexion in both knees would be reduced by 5 degrees, with pain causing functional loss, after repeated use over time, and that flexion in the right knee would be reduced by 10 degrees, with pain causing functional loss, during a flare-up. There was no muscle atrophy, ankylosis, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, ligament tear, or recurrent patellar instability. There was no identified meniscal condition, no indication of nonunion or malunion of the tibia and fibula, or shin splints.

As for Diagnostic Code 5260 concerning limitation of flexion, the Board notes that the Veteran's range of motion has never met the criteria warranted for higher ratings. Indeed, the Veteran's flexion has consistently been found to be more than 45 degrees. As for Diagnostic Code 5261 concerning limitation of extension, the Board notes that the Veteran's range of motion has never met the criteria warranted for higher ratings. Even when considering the functional impairment following repetitive use or during flare-ups, the Veteran's limitation of extension has consistently been found to be 10 degrees or less (the criteria for 10 percent rating under DC 5261). The Board notes that, in assigning the current 10 percent ratings for left and right knee strain, the AOJ considered the Veteran's painful motion in both knees, and adequately considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in Deluca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki. 

The Board has carefully reviewed and considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities, including the functional impairment associated with his disability, as he is competent to report observable symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). However, with respect to the requirements for higher ratings, the Board finds that the medical evidence is more probative, as it offers detailed, specific, specialized determinations pertinent to the rating criteria, and it is the most probative with regard to evaluating the pertinent symptoms for the disability on appeal; the medical evidence also largely contemplates the Veteran's description of symptoms. The lay statements have been considered together with the probative medical evidence clinically evaluating the severity of the pertinent disability symptoms.

The Board has also considered Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, which held that when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant diagnostic code does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability. Here, the Veteran reported that he takes "ibuprofen as needed," providing examples of taking "800mg Ibuprofen daily" during a flare-up. See March 2022 Correspondence. The Veteran did not state that the medication improves his range of motion. However, even if it does, the most limited range of motion findings from the examination are well below the threshold required for a 20 percent rating. Further, at the September 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he did not take any medication for treatment of his knee conditions at that time. The range of motion testing from that examination, which would not have been subject to any ameliorative effects of medication, did not warrant a higher rating. Moreover, the Veteran stated he takes Ibuprofen "as needed," which suggests that the findings at the VA examination are representative of his overall impairment.

Regarding potential entitlement to additional separate ratings, there is no support for separate ratings under DCs 5256 (ankylosis), 5257 (recurrent instability), 5258 (cartilage, semilunar, dislocated) 5259 (cartilage, semilunar, removal of), 5262 (tibia and fibula impairment), or DC 5263 (genu recurvatum) at any time during the appeal period as the record does not reflect the Veteran ever had ankylosis, recurrent instability, removal of semilunar cartilage (meniscus), nonunion or malunion of the tibia and fibula, or genu recurvatum.  

In summation, the Board finds that the weight of the probative evidence is against higher ratings at any other point during the appeal period for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral knee disabilities. Accordingly, higher ratings are not warranted. The appeal of these issues must be denied.

4. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a higher initial rating for his lumbosacral strain. See March 2022 VA Form 20-0995.

By way of background, a November 2021 rating decision awarded service connection for the Veteran's lumbosacral strain, effective August 24, 2021, the date after his discharge from service. The AOJ assigned a 10 percent rating for lumbosacral strain under DC 5237 for combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees, localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour, and painful motion. In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ further noted forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees. In assigning a 10 percent disability rating, the AOJ considered the Veteran's painful motion in the lumbosacral spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. Pettiti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 425 (2015) (holding that § 4.59 serves as a bridge linking painful motion and limitation of motion, such that a claimant with painful motion is deemed to have limited motion under DC 5003 even though actual motion is not limited).

Under DC 5237, a 10 percent rating is assigned if forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; for muscle spasms, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or for vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 

A 20 percent rating is assigned if forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or for muscle spasms or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour. 

A 40 percent rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 

A 50 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 

The maximum 100 percent rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the severity of his back disability in September 2021. Regarding functional impairment, the Veteran reported pain with running and lifting, with standing limited to two hours and walking limited to 45 minutes. See September 2021 C&P Exam at 2. The Veteran reported flare-ups of his back strain that occur monthly and last 3-5 days. The examination was not conducted during a flare-up. Range of motion was normal for forward flexion and extension, and right and left lateral flexion and rotation, with painful motion causing functional loss on extension and right and left lateral flexion. There was no additional loss of range of function or range of motion after repetitive use testing. The examiner estimated that extension would be limited to 25 degrees with repeated use over time or during a flare-up. The examiner noted no guarding, muscle spasms, localized tenderness, muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or IVDS.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in April 2022. Regarding functional impairment, the Veteran reported "pinching muscle pain" that interferes with lifting, prolonged standing and walking, and that affects his school attendance. See April 2022 C&P Exam at 4. The Veteran denied flare-ups of his back pain at this examination. Range of motion was normal for forward flexion and extension, and right and left lateral flexion and rotation, with no evidence of pain. The examiner estimated that, with repeated use over time, the Veteran's forward flexion and extension, and right and left lateral flexion and rotation would all be limited by 5 degrees. The examiner noted no guarding, muscle spasms, localized tenderness, muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or IVDS.

As for Diagnostic Code 5237, the Board notes that the Veteran's range of motion has never met the criteria warranted for higher ratings. Indeed, the Veteran's flexion, extension, and lateral flexion and rotation have consistently been found to be normal. Even when considering the functional impairment following repetitive use or during flare-ups, the Veteran's limitation of flexion has consistently been between 60 and 85 degrees and combined range of motion between 120 and 235 degrees (the criteria for 10 percent rating under DC 5237). The Board notes that, in assigning the current 10 percent rating for lumbosacral strain, the AOJ considered the Veteran's painful motion in his back, and adequately considered the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and § 4.45 concerning functional loss due to pain, fatigue, weakness, or lack of endurance, incoordination, and flare-ups, as cited in Deluca v. Brown and Mitchell v. Shinseki. 

The Board has carefully reviewed and considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his service-connected lumbosacral strain, including the functional impairment associated with his disability, as he is competent to report observable symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). However, with respect to the requirements for higher ratings, the Board finds that the medical evidence is more probative, as it offers detailed, specific, specialized determinations pertinent to the rating criteria, and it is the most probative with regard to evaluating the pertinent symptoms for the disability on appeal; the medical evidence also largely contemplates the Veteran's description of symptoms. The lay statements have been considered together with the probative medical evidence clinically evaluating the severity of the pertinent disability symptoms.

The Board has also considered Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, which held that when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant diagnostic code does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability. Here, the Veteran reported that he takes "ibuprofen as needed," providing examples of taking "200mg when [back] pain got worse" during a flare-up. See March 2022 Correspondence. The Veteran did not state that the medication improves his range of motion. However, even if it does, the most limited range of motion findings from the examination are well below the threshold required for a 20 percent rating. Further, at the September 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he did not take any medication for treatment of his back condition at that time. The range of motion testing from that examination, which would not have been subject to any ameliorative effects of medication, did not warrant a higher rating. Moreover, the Veteran stated he takes Ibuprofen "as needed," which suggests that the findings at the VA examination are representative of his overall impairment.

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy, and the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with his spine disability.

In summation, the Board finds that the weight of the probative evidence is against higher ratings at any other point during the appeal period for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain. Accordingly, a higher rating is not warranted. The appeal of this issue must be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
