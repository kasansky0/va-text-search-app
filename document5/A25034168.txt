REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a thyroid disability, to include the residuals of thyroid cancer (hereinafter, thyroid disability), is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on periods of active duty for training in the United States Marine Corps from July 21, 1963, to December 16, 1963, from June 21, 1964, to July 4, 1964, from August 1, 1965, to August 14, 1965, from January 22, 1966, to January 23, 1966, from July 9, 1966, to July 24, 1966, and from April 5, 1968, to April 7, 1968, with additional service in the Marine Corps Reserve.  For his service, the Veteran was awarded the Rifle Marksman Badge.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.  In his January 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  However, in his February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested to change his appeal from the Direct Review docket to the Evidence Submission docket.  On March 24, 2024, the Board approved the Veteran's docket switch request.

In May 2024, the Board issued a decision denying service connection for a thyroid disability.  The Veteran appealed the May 2024 Board decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In December 2024, the Court granted the parties' joint motion for partial remand (JMPR), vacating the May 2024 Board decision with respect to the claim for service connection for a thyroid disability and remanding the case for compliance with the terms of the JMPR.

Entitlement to service connection for a thyroid disability.

The Veteran contends that he has a thyroid disability related to his military service.

In the December 2024 JMPR, the parties determined that remand was warranted because the Board erred when it failed to remand the Veteran's claim (for entitlement to service connection for a thyroid disability) under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) for a correction of an error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.  Specifically, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1), claimants are "entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of [Chapter 38] before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  Furthermore, Section 3.103(b)(1) requires that notice of the right to a hearing be included in the notice accompanying an AOJ decision.  In the instant case, however, the notice accompanying the initial December 2023 AOJ decision did not include a notice of the right to a hearing-thus preventing the Veteran from being able to make a fully informed decision with respect to his review options.

Thus, the Board must remand this matter for compliance with the Court's December 2024 order granting the parties' JMPR.  See Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998); see also Forcier v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 414, 424-25 (2006) (holding that the duty to ensure compliance with the Court's order extends to the terms of the agreement struck by the parties that forms the basis of the joint motion to remand); cf. McBurney v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2009) (the Board has a duty on remand to ensure compliance with the favorable terms stated in a joint motion for remand or explain why the terms will not be fulfilled).

Specifically, pursuant to the parties' JMPR, a remand is required for the AOJ to provide the Veteran with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1), under which a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim, as well as to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1), which requires that notice of the right to a hearing be included in the notice accompanying an AOJ decision, the AOJ should provide the Veteran and his representative with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ, with respect to his claim for entitlement to service connection for a thyroid disability.
