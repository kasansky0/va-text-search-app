ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of March 14, 2022, but not earlier, for the award of a 40 percent evaluation for chronic sprain of the lumbar spine with spondylitic spondylolisthesis, degenerative arthritis, and disc diseases (hereinafter back disability) is granted, subject to the law and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.

FINDING OF FACT

VA received an intent to file a claim on March 14, 2022, and a formal claim for an increased rating for a back disability on October 4, 2022; thereafter, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim, and he otherwise meets the criteria for a disability evaluation of 40 percent for his back disability, throughout the period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 14, 2022, but not earlier, for a rating of 40 percent for back disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500, 4.1, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242-5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty from July 2007 to April 2012.

The instant matter has an extensive procedural history which will be addressed in further detail below.  

Most recently, in February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to an increased rating for his back disability most recently addressed in a December 2022 rating decision.

In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision which increased the evaluation from 20 to 40 percent for the Veteran's back disability, effective December 28, 2022.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim seeking an earlier effective date for the award of the 40 percent rating for his back disability.

In April 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal which denied the claim.

In his May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

In this case, the Veteran submitted additional evidence in support of his claim after the decision on appeal, as he included a  separate statement with his May 2023 VA form 10182.  

Accordingly, in January 2025, pursuant to Edwards, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking whether he would like to change his docket selection so that the evidence could be reviewed.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f) requires the Board to clarify an appellant's intent when his submission "consisting of the form itself and the attached [evidence]" considered together "raise[s] uncertainty" about the docket selection appellant wanted to use).  The Veteran did not respond to this correspondence and, therefore, the appeal remains on the Direct Review docket.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Date 

Generally, the effective date for the grant of a benefit will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

A claimant may submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim.  An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension), but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

The term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  However, it is the date when the veteran met the requirements for the benefits sought, which is determined on a "facts found" basis.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?28, 35 (2000).  An effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found."  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?45 (2011).  These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.  For instance, if a veteran filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Analysis

Historically, the Veteran's initial application for service connection for a lumbar spine disability was received in July 2012.  The claim was granted in a March 2013 rating decision and assigned a non-compensable evaluation, effective April 24, 2012.

In December 2013, the Veteran filed an informal claim seeking an increased rating for his back disability which was denied in a July 2014 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal nor submit additional evidence within one year and the decision became final.

In February 2018, the Veteran filed a formal claim seeking an increased rating for his back disability.  An April 2018 rating decision increased the evaluation from non-compensable to 20 percent.  The Veteran did not appeal or submit additional evidence within one year and the decision became final.

In February 2021, the Veteran filed a formal claim seeking an increased rating under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system.  In March 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination to assess the severity of his back disability.  

A March 2021 AOJ rating decision proposed a decrease in the evaluation from 20 to 10 percent based on the March 2021 examination.  In response, in April 2021, the Veteran submitted a private evaluation of his back disability.  In May 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision which continued the 20 percent rating.

In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a formal claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for service connection for an additional back disability of spondylolisthesis and submitted a private evaluation in support of the claim.  In December 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination to assess the severity of his back disability.

In January 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision which continued the 20 percent rating for the Veteran's back disability, noting that while he was currently diagnosed with multiple lumbar disorders, only one evaluation may be assigned based on the same disabling manifestations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

On March 14, 2022, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim.  

In October 2022, the Veteran filed a formal claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) seeking an increased rating for his back disability and submitted a private evaluation in support of his claim.  In December 2022, the Veteran attended a VA examination to assess the severity of his back disability.

In December 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision which continued the 20 percent rating for the Veteran's back disability.

On December 28, 2022, the Veteran submitted another intent to file a claim form.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to an increased rating for his back disability most recently addressed in the December 2022 rating decision.

In March 2023, the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision which increased the evaluation from 20 to 40 percent for the Veteran's back disability, effective December 28, 2022.

The Veteran contends, however, that an effective date of March 14, 2022, is warranted for the award of the 40 percent evaluation, as the claim for an increased rating for his back disability has been continuously pursued since that time.  The Board agrees with the Veteran.

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  The review requests include a supplemental claim, higher level review, and appeal to the Board with the filing of a VA Form 10182.  Id.  If a VA Form 21-526 EZ is received within the time period to file a review option, it does not have the effect of preserving the effective date of any previously adjudicated claim (continuous pursuit).  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The Board notes that while the Veteran also pursued an increased rating for his back disability in December 2013 and February 2018 under the previous legacy system, an AOJ decision becomes final unless a notice of disagreement is filed, or new and material evidence is received within the one-year appeal period.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b).  As noted above, the December 2013 and February 2018 rating decisions were not appealed and became final.

The first communication after the final February 2018 rating decision from the Veteran seeking an increased rating for his back disability was his February 2021 formal claim (VA Form 21-526 EZ) with which he submitted additional evidence regarding worsening symptoms of his back disability.  As such, he initiated a new increased rating claim.  Subsequently, an AOJ March 2021 rating decision proposed a reduction, and a May 2021 AOJ decision, not moving forward with a reduction, continued the 20 percent rating for the Veteran's back disability.  

The next communication from the Veteran was a November 2021 formal claim (VA Form 21-526 EZ) for service connection for an additional back disability based on a new diagnosis, submitted with additional medical and lay evidence regarding the worsening of his back disability.  As the Veteran filed his claim with a VA Form 21-526 EZ, it was considered a new claim for worsening, and it does not have the effect of preserving continuous pursuit of the May 2021 AOJ rating decision.  Subsequently, a January 2022 AOJ rating decision incorporated the Veteran's additional back diagnosis into the Veteran's current back disability and continued the 20 percent rating.  

On March 14, 2022, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim.  In October 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526 EZ for an increased rating for his back disability, submitted with new medical and lay evidence, and initiated a new claim for worsening.  Subsequently a December 2022 rating decision denied an evaluation in excess of 20 percent for his back disability.  

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in pursuit of the increased rating for his back disability.  As the claim was submitted within a year of the December 2022 rating decision, the Veteran timely and successfully continuously pursued his claim stemming from the March 2022 intent to file.  Subsequently, in March 2023, the AOJ awarded the 40 percent evaluation currently on appeal.

Given the above, the Board finds that the Veteran has successfully preserved his March 14, 2022, date of claim by continuous pursuit.

Having determined the date of claim as March 14, 2022, the Board must next determine whether a 40 percent rating is warranted from that date.

Entitlement to an Earlier Staged Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects their ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing their symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

While the Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination, where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is a present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that, in determining the present level of a disability for any increased evaluation claim, the Board must consider the application of staged ratings.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

The Veteran's service-connected back disability is evaluated under Diagnostic Code 5242-5237.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, all spinal disabilities are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  If the Veteran has Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS), the Veteran may also be evaluated under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, as the Veteran is not diagnosed with IVDS, the IVDS formula is not applicable and will not be addressed further. 

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Here, the use of Diagnostic Codes 5242-5237 reflects that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is partially described as degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), under Diagnostic Code 5242, and that the rating assigned is based upon lumbosacral strain under Diagnostic Code 5237.

Under the General Rating Formula, in pertinent part, a 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 

A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 

A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. 

A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Ankylosis is complete immobility of the joint in a fixed position, either favorable or unfavorable.  Dinsay v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 79, 81 (1996); Lewis v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 259 (1992).

The General Rating Formula also provides at Note (1) that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities should be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  In this case, separate ratings are already in effect for associated bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and no other associated objective neurologic abnormalities are shown.  

The current spine rating criteria provide specific values for range of motion of the cervical and thoracolumbar (thoracic and lumbar) spine.  For the thoracolumbar spine, normal range of motion on forward flexion is zero to 90 degrees; backwards extension, zero to 30 degrees; left and right lateral flexion, zero to 30 degrees; and, left and right lateral rotation, zero to 30 degrees.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Note (2) (see also Plate V).

Turning toward the evidence of record, in October 2022, the Veteran submitted a statement in support of his claim.  The Veteran stated that he has had problems with his back since an in-service injury.  At the time of the injury, he was told he had chronic lumbar strain, when in fact he had broken his back, the L5 vertebrae specifically, and had spondylolisthesis.  Following the injury, he was not put on light duty.  Instead, within an hour of the injury, he was back working on the flight deck.  He believes that if he had been properly treated at the time, including with a brace, he could have healed and would not be dealing with the pain he has today.  He stated that his back has progressively gotten worse, including a present ROM flexion to only 15 degrees.  He contends that range of motion (ROM) measurements were not performed correctly by at least one VA examiner, and therefore he has submitted a private evaluation from a licensed doctor who properly performed the tests with a goniometer.

In October 2022, VA received a private evaluation of the Veteran's back disability, conducted by Dr. J.B. in August 2022.  The Veteran reported that his back pain and limited ROM made it difficult for him to properly train his fitness clients.  During flare-ups, the Veteran reported that he was unable to perform basic daily tasks.  The physician provided diagnoses of mechanical back pain, degenerative disc disease, degenerative spondylolisthesis, radiculopathy, and other specified lumbar dorsopathy.  Initial ROM testing showed forward flexion to 20 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 20 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees.  ROM after repetitive-use testing showed forward flexion to 20 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees.  The physician noted that pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination would significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability during flare ups or after repeated use over time.  The physician stated that an estimation in terms of ROM was not feasible due to the pain caused by flare-ups.  The report was negative for IVDS and ankylosis.  

In December 2022, the Veteran attended a VA back conditions examination during which the examiner diagnosed chronic sprain of the lumbar spine with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis, degenerative arthritis, disc disease, and bilateral lower extremity lumbar radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported discomfort when flexed and difficulty with sitting and standing.  The Veteran endorsed daily moderate to severe flare-ups precipitated by sitting, walking, standing, lifting, working out, or strenuous activity.  Initial active ROM testing showed forward flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 20 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees.  Passive ROM measured the same as active.  Pain was exhibited on all planes during the examination.  ROM after repetitive-use testing showed forward flexion to 55 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees.  ROM estimates after repeated use over time were noted as forward flexion to 50 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 10 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees.  ROM estimates during flare-ups were noted as forward flexion to 45 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 10 degrees, and right and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees.  The physician noted that pain and lack of endurance would significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability during flare-ups or after repeated use over time.  The report was negative for IVDS and ankylosis.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that a rating of 40 percent, but not higher,  is warranted for the Veteran's back disability for the entire appeal period. 

The Board acknowledges that the December 2022 VA examination recorded ROM results of forward flexion to 45 degrees at worst (a measurement which is contemplated by a 20 percent disability rating).  However, the Board also finds the August 2022 private medical evaluation highly probative as it is supported by an in-person examination, includes consideration of the Veteran's lay statements, and shows that the examiner is familiar with the Veteran's service and medical history.  See D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2008).  As the August 2022 private medical report provides probative evidence that the Veteran's forward flexion was less than 30 degrees and considering the Veteran's statements that he was experiencing the same symptoms since the date of his notice of intent, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the criteria for a 40 percent disability rating has been met since March 14, 2022.  

As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the criteria have been met and a 40 percent evaluation is warranted from March 14, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A review of the record, however, indicates that March 14, 2022, is the earliest possible effective date assignable for the 40 percent rating.  

In that regard, the Board has considered whether an effective date prior to March 14, 2022, is warranted under the "look-back" provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) and concludes that it is not.  There is no medical evidence of record received within a year of March 14, 2022, that reflects a ROM forward flexion measurement of less than 30 degrees.  In addition, the Board notes that the 20 percent evaluation assigned during that period, in a May 2021 rating decision, was based on the results of an April 2021 DBQ provided by the Veteran.

Further, the Board finds that a rating greater than 40 percent is not warranted at any time pertinent to the appeal.  There is no evidence of favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine as required to support a 50 or 100 percent disability rating, or its functional equivalent.

In sum, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that an effective date of March 14, 2022, but not earlier, for the award of a 40 percent evaluation for chronic sprain of the lumbar spine with spondylitic spondylolisthesis, degenerative arthritis, and disc diseases is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.71a; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776, 780-81.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
