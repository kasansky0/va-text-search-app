REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for migraine headaches is remanded.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for thoracolumbar spine strain is remanded. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service in the Navy from November 2004 until November 2008 and in the Army from February 2012 until February 2013; from December 2014 until December 2018; and from February 2019 until August 2021.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In a November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. s

However, because the Board is remanding the increased rating claims listed above, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to a compensable rating for migraine headaches is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for thoracolumbar spine strain is remanded. 

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for unspecified trauma and stressor related disorder

The Board finds that the Veteran's claims must be remanded to comply with VA's duty to assist.

The record reflects that the Veteran's address currently on file with the VA is an overseas post office box to which mail has been sent since December 2022 without being returned as undeliverable. In addition to that address, the Veteran also listed a telephone number in his February 2023 claim. He further indicated ongoing treatment at a U.S. Army garrison in Italy on his February 2023 claim form. A VADIR report indicates the Veteran began a period of Guard/Reserve Active Service on July 13, 2022.

Exam scheduling request documents indicate that the Veteran was scheduled for headache, back, and psychiatric examinations on March 15, 2023. However, the record indicates all examinations were canceled because the VA was "unable to contact" the Veteran.

When a claimant fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with a claim for increase, the claim shall be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). The United States Court of Veterans Affairs (Court) has held that the burden is on VA to demonstrate that notice was sent to the claimant's last address of record and that the claimant lacked adequate reason or good cause for failing to report for a scheduled examination. Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993).

Here, the there is no scheduling letter in the file indicating that the Veteran was informed via mail that he had been scheduled for examinations or any indication as to what other contact the VA attempted to notify the Veteran of the scheduled examinations. Therefore, to ensure compliance with the VA's duty to assist, the Board finds that a remand is warranted to provide the Veteran with proper notice and an opportunity to appear for a VA examination.

There is further no indication in the record that the VA made attempts to obtain any medical records the Veteran identified as receiving at the U.S. Army garrison. VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining records in the custody of a federal department or agency, to include military records. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2). On remand, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain such records as part of VA's duty to assist.

The Board reminds the Veteran that the duty to assist is not a one-way street. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). Therefore, it is incumbent upon him to cooperate with VA in developing his claims, consistent with the directives discussed below. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's identified medical treatment records.

2. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to assess the nature and severity of his service-connected back, headache, and psychiatric disabilities. Apprise him of the date, time and location of the examinations. Also, upload a copy of the examination notification letter sent to the Veteran to the Veteran's claims file.
