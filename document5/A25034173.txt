ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 15, 2022, (with payment beginning on January 1, 2023), for the addition of the Veteran's child, A., to her award of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 15, 2022, the Veteran first submitted a claim for additional VA disability compensation benefits based on recognition of A. as her dependent child.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to December 15, 2022, for the addition of the Veteran's child, A., to her award of VA disability compensation, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.204, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from August 2012 to March 2019.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 higher level review (HLR) decision of a VA Regional Office (RO).

In a September 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 decisional letter that was subject to HLR.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the appellant and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 15, 2022, for the addition of the Veteran's child, A., as her dependent to her award of VA disability compensation.

The Veteran's child, A., was added as her dependent to her award of VA disability compensation, effective December 15, 2022, with payment beginning on January 1, 2023.  She contends that an earlier effective date of the date of A.'s birth is warranted.

Veterans who have service-connected disabilities rated as 30 percent disabling and higher may be entitled to additional compensation for dependents.  38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).  In this case, the Veteran has been in receipt of a disability rating in excess of 30 percent disability since March 14, 2019.  Therefore, the Veteran has been entitled to additional compensation for dependents for the entire period on appeal.

When determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the service member's award.  38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for a dependent child is the date of the child's birth, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of notification of such rating action.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The Secretary has authority to prescribe the nature and extent of the proof required in order to establish a right to VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 501.

If a claimant's application for a benefit under the laws administered by the Secretary is incomplete, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application.  38 U.S.C. § 5102(b).  If information that a claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, are notified under subsection (b) is necessary to complete an application is not received by the Secretary within one year from the date such notice is sent, no benefit may be paid or furnished by reason of the claimant's application.  38 U.S.C. § 5102(c).  Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).

VA will accept, for purposes of determining entitlement to benefits under laws administered by VA, the statement of a claimant as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event; the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; and the social security number of the other person.  38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204.

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits begins the first day of the month following the effective date. However, beneficiaries will be deemed to be in receipt of monetary benefits during the period between the effective date of the award and the date payment commences.  38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material favorable to the claimant.  Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See?Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

In the present case, the Veteran is seeking an effective date of September 2021, the date of A.'s birth, for the addition of A. as her dependent child to her award of VA disability compensation.  

In the December 2022 decision on that was subject to HLR in the decision on appeal, the RO assigned an effective date of December 15, 2022, with payment beginning on January 1, 2023, for the addition of A. as the Veteran's dependent to her award of VA disability compensation.

The Board has carefully reviewed the record and finds no basis under the law to award an effective date earlier than December 15, 2022, for the addition of A. as the Veteran's dependent to her award of VA disability compensation.  The Veteran had one year from date of A.'s birth to notify VA of A.'s birth and submit a claim for additional dependency benefits, for A.'s date of birth to be considered the date of claim.  However, this is not demonstrated.  There is no evidence in the file showing that, within one year of A.'s birth, the VA received A.'s birth certificate or any other evidence or statement that would serve to inform VA of A.'s birth or express an intent to file a claim for additional dependency benefits for A.  

To the contrary, the record shows that the VA did not receive notice of A.'s birth and a claim for additional dependency benefits for A. until December 15, 2022, which is clearly outside the relevant one-year period.  Accordingly, the RO has already assigned the earliest possible effective date for the addition of A. as the Veteran's dependent to her award of VA disability compensation benefits. 

Consequently, there is no legal basis upon which to grant an effective date prior to December 15, 2022, for the addition of A. as the Veteran's dependent child to her award of VA disability compensation.  The Board sympathizes with the Veteran regarding the inequities she may believe result in not being entitled to those dependent benefits at an earlier time.  However, the Board is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; see also Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).  The Board further observes that "no equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress."  See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992), citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990).  The Board is bound by the law governing the assignment of effective dates in its determination in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c).

Based on the foregoing, the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to December 15, 2022, for the addition of A. as the Veteran's dependent child to her award of VA disability compensation must be denied.
