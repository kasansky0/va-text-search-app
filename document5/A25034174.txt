ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's plantar fasciitis began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for plantar fasciitis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 2013 to August 2014, and from December 2021 to August 2022.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024).  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for plantar fasciitis

The Veteran asserts that his plantar fasciitis began during active service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

While on active duty, the Veteran awoke one morning with pain in both feet.  See June 2024 C&P Exam.  The Veteran sought treatment in April 2022, complaining of bilateral heel pain for a few months.  A diagnosis of plantar fascial fibromatosis was given.  See March 2024 JLV/MTR.

The Veteran was afforded an examination in connection with this claim.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's plantar fasciitis was at least likely as not incurred during active service.  As rationale, the examiner cited the Veteran's service treatment records.  See June 2024 C&P Exam.  There is no evidence on file that contradicts this opinion.

Despite this opinion, the AOJ denied this claim because "There is no evidence to support an in service event for [the Veteran's] complaint."  See July 2024 Rating Decision.  However, service connection does not require that a current disability be related to a particular exposure or any other causal agent in service, it only requires that a current disability had its onset in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) ("service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of veterans' benefits.  This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").

The evidence on file shows that the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis began during active serve.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis is warranted.
