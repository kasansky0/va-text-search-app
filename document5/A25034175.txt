2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the rating for left tibia stress fracture have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7108; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

3. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the rating for right tibia stress fracture have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7108; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2019 to July 2019.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). 

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. The appeal of a proposed rating reduction of Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder 

Procedurally, service connection for the Veteran's Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (hereinafter, psychiatric disability) was granted in a November 2019 rating decision with a 70 percent disability evaluation.  Thereafter, VA notified the Veteran by letter in June 2023 of a proposal to reduce the disability rating assigned to his psychiatric disability due to improvement of those conditions.  This letter also gave the Veteran instructions for submitting additional evidence regarding the propriety of the proposed reduction.  A June 2023 rating decision accompanied the notification letter, explaining that a period of due process was in effect for 30 days.

While the Veteran did not submit evidence within the 30-day period, he did submit a July 2023 VA Form 10182, Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the Direct Review docket.  However, a proposal to reduce a rating or benefit is not an appealable issue because it is not an adverse decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  The proposed reduction is just that, a proposal.  As there is no AOJ rating decision for the Board to review, the claim was erroneously docketed.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  The Board's authority to review an adverse decision by the AOJ is initiated by the claimant submitting a notice of disagreement, which identifies the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  Id.  Here, there was no adverse determination to appeal, as the AOJ had not effectuated any reduction at the time the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182 Board Appeal.  Therefore, the appeal of the proposed rating reduction for the Veteran's Major Depressive Disorder with Generalized Anxiety Disorder is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The appeal of the rating for left tibia stress fracture

3. The appeal of the rating for right tibia stress fracture

The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7108.  An appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the AOJ mails the notice of decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

An appeal to the Board begins with contesting the AOJ's denial of a benefit sought by the Veteran.  The Veteran, or his representative, must file a Notice of Disagreement, Supplemental Claim, or Higher-Level Review within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination.  The date of the mailing of this letter will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.302.  Both the Veteran and the representative are entitled to notice of such decisions.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b).

A question as to timeliness or adequacy of the notice of disagreement shall be decided by the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C).  A claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.  Id.  Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board.  Id. 

Historically, service connection for the Veteran's left and right tibia stress fractures was granted in an October 2019 rating decision with each rated as noncompensable.  By letter dated October 21, 2019, the Veteran and his representative received a copy of this rating decision, along with a notice letter which included a section entitled "What You Should Do If You Disagree With Our Decision."  This section included the information that, "If you do not agree with our decision, you have one year from the date of this letter to select a review option in order to protect your initial filing date for effective date purposes."  The three review options provided were those of a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or an Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  An enclosed VA Form provided more detailed information, and the letter included a website to which the Veteran could refer to learn more about how the disagreement process works.

The Veteran, however, did not file any type of application for administrative review within one year of the October 21, 2019, notification letter.  Rather, he took no action regarding the left and right tibia stress fractures until he filed an increased rating claim in October 2021, more than two years later.  

A January 2022 rating decision continued the noncompensable rating for service-connected left and right tibia stress fractures.  By letter dated January 12, 2022, the Veteran and his representative received a copy of this rating decision, along with a notice letter which included a section entitled "What You Should Do If You Disagree With Our Decision."  This section included the information that, "If you do not agree with our decision, you have one year from the date of this letter to select a review option in order to protect your initial filing date for effective date purposes."  The three review options provided were those of a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or an Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  An enclosed VA Form provided more detailed information, and the letter included a website to which the Veteran could refer to learn more about how the disagreement process works.

Again, the Veteran did not file any type of application for administrative review within one year of the January 12, 2022, notification letter. 

As discussed previously, VA notified the Veteran by letter in June 2023 of a proposal to reduce the disability rating assigned to his psychiatric disability due to improvement of those conditions.  A June 2023 rating decision accompanied the notification letter.

When the Veteran submitted his July 2023 VA Form 10182, Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Direct Review docket, he listed the issues of "PTSD, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, fractured left shin, fractured right shin" and identified the date of the rating decision for appeal as June 2023.  The Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 appeal in a July 2023 letter. 

As the Veteran was informed in the October 2019 and January 2022 notices, governing law and regulation provides claimants with one year in which to contest a denial decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

Because the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Board Appeal, was filed over one year after both the October 2019 and January 2022 decisions, the appeal regarding left and right tibia stress fractures is untimely.  The AOJ did not adjudicate the left and right tibia stress fractures in the June 2023 decision.

The Board also notes that a claimant may request an extension of the period for filing an appeal for good cause.  A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).  However, in this case the Veteran did not request a filing extension (including COVID) or offer good cause.  Therefore, such an extension is not warranted, and the Board finds no circumstances suggesting an equitable tolling of the appeal deadline.

In so holding, the Board observes that, in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims referenced a notice of disagreement (NOD) under the legacy system as a "nonjurisdictional claims processing rule" and specifically stated that "[t]o the extent that any of our prior cases have held that the deadline for filing an NOD is jurisdictional, they are overruled."  This reasoning should also apply to an NOD under the AMA.  As such, the Board clarifies that this appeal is not being dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but rather for failure to comply with the claims processing rules.  Therefore, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c) do not apply.

The Veteran's appeal has been docketed at the Board.  However, as with any appellate system, the Board's mere administrative docketing of a claim does not demonstrate acceptance or waiver of a claims processing rule as it is a ministerial act.  See Martin v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In this case, the Board has found that the Veteran did not submit a timely VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  As such, the claim is dismissed for failure to comply with the appropriate claims processing rules regarding perfection of a Board appeal per 38 C.F.R. § 20.402.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7108.

If he wishes to continue pursuing the claim, the Veteran is invited to file a supplemental claim along with a submission of new and relevant evidence to support increased ratings for left and right tibia stress fractures.
