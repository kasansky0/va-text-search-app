CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the withdrawal of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services for the July 2, 2019, episode of care have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, JFK Memorial Hospital, is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical care to the Veteran on July 2, 2019.

In January 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA Medical Center for the July 2, 2019, episode of care.

The appellant filed a claim seeking entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services for the July 2, 2019, episode of care.  The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of fact or law in any matter which under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) is subject to a decision by the Secretary.  38 U.S.C. § 7104.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Under the modernized appeals system, a claimant may withdraw an appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  To be effective, the withdrawal must provide the name of the claimant, his or her file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id. at § 20.205(b).  A withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.  Id.

In December 2022, the appellant submitted a statement indicating that they wished to withdraw the appeal.  The appellant verified that the account had been resolved and was inactive.  The appellant stated they wanted to withdraw their claim seeking entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the July 2, 2019, non-VA episode of care.

This withdrawal was submitted by the appellant, included their name and file number, clearly identified the appeal being withdrawn, and is unambiguous as to intent. As each element of § 20.205(b) has been met, the withdrawal is accepted and effective as of the date of filing.  The appeal  seeking entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services for the July 2, 2019, episode of care is dismissed.
