FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include mood disorder and anxiety, began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had dyspnea at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an ear disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had chest pain at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a female sexual disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include mood disorder and anxiety, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for dyspnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for an ear disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for chest pain are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

5. The criteria for service connection for a female sexual disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from June 1968 to November 1969.  

The Veteran filed this claim in December 2021; she died in February 2023. The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse, who has been substituted for the Veteran pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5121A.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  The Board sent correspondence to the appellant advising the appellant of the steps necessary to switch from the direct review docket to the evidence review docket, which would potentially allow the Board to consider evidence submitted up to 90 days following the Notice of Disagreement, and, in the absence of election to the contrary, the Board can determine, and does determine, that the Veteran desires direct review.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after separation when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Certain chronic diseases, including psychoses, may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree in a specified period of time post-service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. That period of time is usually one year. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(3). For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), an alternative method of establishing an in-service disease or injury and a nexus for chronic diseases is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007); see Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495-97 (1997); see also Clyburn v. West, 12 Vet. App. 296, 302 (1999). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. Savage, 10 Vet. App. at 495-96; Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999) (lay evidence of in-service incurrence sufficient in some circumstances for purposes of establishing service connection); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis or etiology when (1) a lay person is competent to identify a medical condition; (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include mood disorder 

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety

The appellant contends that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include mood disorder and anxiety, were the result of the Veteran's military service, and he seeks service connection.  Specifically, the Veteran had alleged that her psychological disorders are attributable to a military sexual trauma (MST) that occurred during service. The Veteran asserts that she was discharged for pregnancy after the MST.

Historically, the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ in February 2020 seeking service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to MST.  In a June 2020 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim finding that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of PTSD, so a grant of the claim was not warranted.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and no new and relevant evidence was received within one year of the decision.  The June 2020 rating decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104, 20.203, 20.1103 (2019).

In December 2021, the Veteran filed a Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526 EZ, seeking service connection for an anxiety disorder and mood disorder.  

To afford the Veteran the broadest possible scope for her claims, the issues have been recharacterized accordingly to that of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include a mood disorder and anxiety as due to MST. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1,6 (2009).

Turning to the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any diagnosis or treatment for any mental health disorders during active service.  An October 1969 Report of Medical Examination at the time of separation was negative for any psychiatric disorders with clinical evaluation. 

Private treatment records from January 2020 reveal that the Veteran had diagnoses of chronic PTSD, major depressive disorder, and insomnia due to mental health disorder.  At the time of the encounter, the Veteran reported that she had experienced MST during active service that resulted in the birth of a child. 

In a February 2020 statement the Veteran reported that the MST occurred in January 1969 during active service.  She identified that the MST occurred in a church.  The Veteran described that she was in the basement supply when the MST occurred.  The Veteran explained that she feared the alleged perpetrator and that every morning she was told not to tell anyone.

In a March 2020 statement, the Veteran's husband reported that the Veteran did not have any interest in being intimate.

In June 2020, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  A diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder (PDD) was rendered.  The Veteran reported the circumstances of the MST to the examiner.  The examiner noted that there were no markers of to substantiate the MST claim and that the Veteran indicated that her records would not have any information about the alleged MST.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was not consistent in her reporting of the MST with respect to the date of the MST as she gave vastly different time frames from January 1969 to summer of 1969 to January 1969.  Additionally, the examiner noted that the Veteran could not recall the date of birth of the child the Veteran claimed was the byproduct of the alleged MST.  Further, the Veteran reported that she was married at the time of the alleged MST and could not articulate how she knew the child was the byproduct of the alleged MST as opposed to relations with her then husband.  At the time of the encounter, the Veteran endorsed symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment.  She presented with an affect that was sometimes tearful, but otherwise of normal range and control.  Her appearance was rather poorly dressed and obese.  The Veteran's level of engagement was adequate.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.  

The June 2020 examiner opined that the Veteran's current PDD was not incurred in or caused by military service because it was not likely that MST occurred during service.  In particular, the examiner explained that the psychiatric examination of the Veteran failed to identify any markers of the Veteran's claimed MST.  Moreover, the examiner explained that during the interview, the Veteran was not clear on the dates or the circumstances surrounding the claimed MST, to include the date of the birth of the child the Veteran claimed was a byproduct of the MST. Further, the examiner explained that the Veteran's current PDD is not otherwise related to her active military service; rather, it is the result of failed marriage, financial difficulty, and unhappy lifestyle post service. 

In December 2021, the Veteran submitted a statement in support of her claim.  The Veteran described her encounter with a delivery driver during her active military service.  She explained that he was also a soldier and that he committed an MST against her.  The Veteran described that he had followed her into the basement supply room, and then explained that he grabbed her as she entered his truck to carry items to the basement supply room.  She described that he closed the truck door and that he assaulted her while in the truck.

In light of the evidence as discussed above, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and a mood disorder as due to MST is not warranted.  The June 2020 VA opinion is both probative and persuasive as it is based on a review of the claims file and supported by sufficiently clear and well-reasoned medical rationale in concluding there were no markers found to support the alleged MST occurred and the Veteran's current psychiatric disorders are not related to military service.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion is derived from a factually accurate, fully articulated, and soundly reasoned opinion). The file contains no competent medical evidence refuting this examination.

Moreover, the Veteran's account of in-service events is not supported by the record. Although service records confirm the Veteran was discharged for pregnancy, clinical psychological evaluation at the time of separation was normal.  Moreover, the Veteran's various statements regarding the details of the MST are entitled to little credibility, as they are inconsistent and revised with each new recounting of the attack. Notably in a March 2020, the Veteran reported the assault occurred in a church in the basement supply room in January 1969.  At the time of the June 2020 VA examination, the Veteran reported that the assault occurred in the summer of 1969 and then later stated that it occurred in January 1969.  In December 2021, the Veteran reported that the attack occurred in the delivery truck and not in the supply room of the basement.  While the Veteran alleged that one of her children is the byproduct of the alleged MST, the Veteran could not recall the birthdate of that child at the time of the June 2020 VA examination.  In this case the Board finds the Veteran's various statements regarding the details of the MST lack credibility, as they are inconsistent and revised with each new recounting of the assault. See Macarubbo v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 388 (1997) (holding that the credibility of lay evidence can be affected and even impeached by inconsistent statements, internal inconsistency of statements, inconsistency with other evidence of record, facial implausibility, bad character, interest, bias, self-interest, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and witness demeanor).

The Board has also considered the February 2020 statement of the Veteran's husband providing an account that the Veteran did not like to be touched by him, and she lacked interest in intimacy.  However, this statement was made years later and does not contain any probative information about an alleged MST on the Veteran during her active military service. 

The evidence also does not establish that the Veteran's diagnosed psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including PDD, claimed anxiety, and claimed mood disorder are etiologically related to military service.  As noted above, the June 2020 VA opinion is both probative and persuasive medical evidence in this case, as it is based upon a review of the claims file and supported by sufficiently clear and well-reasoned medical rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 304.  Because the Veteran's diagnosed psychiatric disorder other than PTSD was not present in service and there is no competent medical evidence relating it to service, the claims cannot be granted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence weights persuasively against the Veteran's claims, the doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

3. Entitlement to service connection for dyspnea

4. Entitlement to service connection for an ear disorder

5. Entitlement to service connection for chest pain

6. Entitlement to service connection for a female sexual disorder

The appellant has contended that the Veteran had dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, and a female sexual disorder, as a result of active military service, and he seeks service connection. 

Turning to the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any diagnosis or treatment for dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, and female sexual disorder during active service.  A June 1968 Report of Medical Examination from the time of enlistment reveals normal clinical evaluations at the ears, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and a normal clinical pelvic evaluation.  Likewise, an October 1969 Report of Medical Examination at the time of separation revealed a normal physical evaluation but reported that the Veteran was then currently pregnant.

VA treatment records of record also do not reveal any complaints or treatments for dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, or female sexual disorder. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have current diagnoses of or associated with dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, or female sexual disorder, and has not had any at any time during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claims.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  The Board acknowledges that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity." Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, the record does not show that the Veteran has symptoms of any of the claimed disorders that reach the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.

The Board notes that the Veteran has not been afforded VA examinations to determine the etiology of her claimed dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, or female sexual disorder but finds as a fact in this case that VA examinations are not necessary. The VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service related disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also, 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i).  In this case, there are no present disabilities.  As such, VA examinations are not warranted.

While the Veteran is competent to describe observable symptoms of dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, and female sexual disorder, she is not competent to opine as to the etiology of such symptoms, as she has not been shown to possess the requisite training or credentials needed to render a competent opinion as to medical diagnosis or causation. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). As such, her lay opinion that she has diagnoses of dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, and female sexual disorder does not constitute competent medical evidence and lacks probative value.  Moreover, the Veteran is not credible to the extent she is asserting she has dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, or female sexual disorder, or that they were caused by or incurred during service. The records do not reflect that, and the medical evidence does not show any diagnosis or complaints of dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, or female sexual disorder. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995). The Veteran's assertions are assigned less weight. 

In reaching the decision to deny the claim, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, the greater weight of the most probative evidence is against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for dyspnea, an ear disorder, chest pain, and female sexual disorder, and therefore, the doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
