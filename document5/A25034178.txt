REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1993 to January 1998.  

In May 2022 the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for OSA most recently addressed in a March 2022 rating decision.  

In June 2022 the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability, entitlement to service connection for hypertension, and entitlement to service connection for DM.  These claims had most recently addressed in an April 2022 rating decision.  

In July 2022 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 (OSA) or April 2022 (left knee, hypertension, DM) decisions.  

In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 or April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under the provisions of the AMA, the Board must remand any appeal that cannot be granted in full for correction of a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The duty to assist requires VA to provide an examination when the record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability or signs and symptoms of a current disability, the record indicates that the disability or signs and symptoms of disability may be associated with military service, and the record does not contain sufficient information to make a decision on the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83 (2006).

VA has a duty to ensure any medical examination or opinion it provides is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007) (overruled on other grounds, Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013)).  A medical opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the full medical history and describes a disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation will be fully informed.  Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

Service connection is warranted for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  An opinion regarding secondary service connection is inadequate if it does not address both causation and aggravation of the nonservice-connected condition.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138 (2013); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Obesity may serve as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a).  Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020); see also VAOGCPREC 1-2017.  In such a case, the evidence would need to reflect that (1) a service-connected disability or disabilities caused the Veteran to become obese or aggravated the Veteran's obesity, (2) the obesity or aggravation of obesity resulting from service-connected disability or disabilities was a substantial factor in causing another disability, and (3) the disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities.  Walsh, 32 Vet. App. at 306-7.

On August 10, 2022, the President signed the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) into law, establishing substantial legislative changes for how VA processes claims for toxic exposed veterans.  As relevant here, the PACT Act changed medical examination requirements when there is toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  Specifically, Section 303, implemented in 38 U.S.C. § 1168, requires VA to obtain a medical opinion as to whether there is a nexus between the disability and the TERA.  Under the PACT Act, VA must consider the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities.  38 U.S.C. § 1168.  The only exception to this requirement occurs when the Secretary determines there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and the TERA.  38 U.S.C. § 1168(b).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability.  The July 2022 rating decision includes a favorable finding that left knee degenerative joint disease has been diagnosed.  In a December 2021 statement, the Veteran asserts he initially experienced knee pain, onset with physical training and ruck marches, during his active service.  As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to report his experience of left knee pain.  His statement is consistent with the circumstances of his active service.  In June 2022, the Veteran's representative asserted service connection was also warranted for the left knee disability on a secondary basis.  He contended "all of the musculoskeletal system is interrelated" and the Veteran's service connected musculoskeletal disabilities (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability) created the risk of a secondary injury to his left knee.  Although a VA knee conditions examination was provided in March 2022, the AOJ did not obtain an etiology opinion as to any left knee disability.  Under the low threshold of McLendon, the failure to obtain a left knee etiology opinion is a pre decisional duty to assist error.  The claim must be remanded to correct this error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see also McLendon, supra.

The Board notes VA's initial sub-regulatory guidance regarding the PACT Act indicates a TERA opinion is generally not required for claims based on physical trauma/orthopedic disabilities; therefore, a TERA opinion does not appear necessary regarding the left knee claim, unless the Veteran submits competent medical or scientific evidence of an association between the claimed disability and a conceded in-service TERA.  See VBA Letter 20-22-10, Exception to TERA Examination and Medical Opinion Requirement (December 22, 2022).

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, (DM) is remanded.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for DM.  The July 2022 rating decision includes a favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with DM.  VA and private treatment records show the Veteran is obese.  In a December 2021 statement, the Veteran's representative asserts the Veteran gained weight due to his service connected musculoskeletal conditions (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability) and this weight gain put him at risk for developing DM.  The Board notes service connection is also established for depressive disorder.  A VA opinion addressing whether obesity is an intermediate step between the claimed DM and the Veteran's service connected disabilities has not been obtained.  The failure to obtain this opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The claim must be remanded to correct the errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see also McLendon, supra.. 

VA memoranda from August 2023, September 2024, and February 2025 concede the Veteran's in-service participation in TERAs.  These memoranda identify exposures related to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) duties of maintaining and repairing electronic equipment and to activities related to earing the parachutist badge and the sharpshooter badge.  Under the PACT Act, a VA opinion should be obtained regarding whether DM is caused by the Veteran's participation in a TERA.  38 U.S.C. § 1168

3. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  The July 2022 rating decision includes a favorable finding that he has been diagnosed with hypertension.  The service treatment records include multiple blood pressure readings.  Some readings, including readings of 156/80 (August 1995) 152/84 (May 1995), 144/78 (January 1994), show the Veteran's blood pressure may have been elevated during his active service.  A VA opinion as to whether hypertension is directly related to the Veteran's active service has not been obtained.  

In a December 2021 statement, the Veteran's representative asserts obesity is an intermediate step between hypertension and the Veteran's service connected disabilities.  A VA opinion addressing this contention has not been obtained.  The failure to obtain a direct service connection opinion and an opinion addressing secondary service connection with obesity as an intermediate step is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The claim must be remanded to correct the errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see also McLendon, supra. 

VA memoranda from August 2023, September 2024, and February 2025 concede the Veteran's in-service participation in TERAs.  Under the PACT Act, a VA opinion should be obtained regarding whether hypertension is caused by the Veteran's participation in a TERA.  38 U.S.C. § 1168.

4. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) remanded.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for OSA, including as secondary to tinnitus.  The July 2022 rating decision includes favorable findings that OSA is diagnosed and service connection is established for tinnitus.  During a September 2021 VA sleep apnea examination and in a December 2021 statement, the Veteran reported he had been a "heavy snorer" since his early 20's.  He generally did not sleep well and never felt rested.  On waking, his mouth was dry, and his tongue felt swollen.  He also remembered, his former wife told him that he snored and stopped breathing in his sleep while serving on active duty.  Similarly, in a September 2021 statement, his former wife recalled during their marriage (November 1996 to June 2002) the Veteran snored and stopped breathing while he was sleeping.  The Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms (feeling tired, dry mouth, swollen tongue) and his wife is competent to report her observation of these symptoms (snoring, stopping breathing).  In the December 2021 statement the Veteran contends his initial sleep difficulty was associated with the onset of his tinnitus disability.  In December 2021, the Veteran's representative asserted the Veteran's service connected musculoskeletal disabilities resulted in weight gain and that the Veteran's obesity caused or aggravated his sleep apnea.  

In the September 2021 VA sleep apnea examination, a VA examiner confirmed a diagnosis of OSA.  She opined the condition was less likely than not caused by the Veteran's service connected tinnitus.  In support she stated sleep apneas were typically caused by a blockage of the upper airway during sleep and tinnitus did not obstruct the airways.  She noted tinnitus "may contribute to interrupted sleep,"  however she did not opine as to whether tinnitus aggravated the sleep apnea condition.  This opinion is inadequate to evaluate whether OSA is secondary to tinnitus because it did not address both causation and aggravation.  See El-Amin, supra.  The failure to obtain an adequate secondary service connection opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The AOJ did not obtain opinions as to direct service connection (based on lay statements describing sleep difficulties during active service) or as to whether obesity served as an intermediate step between service connected disabilities and OSA.  The failure to obtain these opinions is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  The clam must be remanded to correct these errors.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see also McLendon, supra.

As noted above, VA memoranda concede the Veteran's in-service participation in TERAs.  Under the PACT Act, a VA opinion should be obtained regarding whether the diagnosed OSA is related to the Veteran's participation in a TERA

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's left knee disability is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balanced of positive and negative evidence) related to his reported in-service knee pain, including pain related to physical training or ruck marches.  

If a positive opinion as to direct service connection is not provided, the clinician should also opine as to whether the left knee disability is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balanced of positive and negative evidence) proximately due to, or aggravated by, the Veteran's service connected musculoskeletal disabilities (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability).  

The opinion must explicitly address both causation and aggravation to be deemed adequate, acknowledging these are separate inquires that require different rationales.  In this context, the examiner must be advised aggravation means any increase in disability, i.e., additional functional impairment in earning capacity, resulting from the secondarily claimed condition due to the primary disability.  There is no requirement that such increase be permanent in nature.  An opinion that simply states there is no anatomical or biological connection between the conditions without addressing whether there is additional functional impairment in earning capacity will be deemed insufficient to facilitate an informed decision on the Veteran's claim(s).  If aggravation is found, the clinician must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the secondarily claimed condition prior to aggravation by the service-connected disability.

For the purposes of the opinion, the clinician should assume the Veteran's statements about his symptoms and history are credible, unless they are inconsistent with the evidence of record or with medical principles concerning his condition.  The Board emphasizes that this does not constitute a positive credibility determination, as the Board will weigh the evidence, if necessary, should the claim(s) return on appeal.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.  In doing so, the clinician may identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or contradictions contained in the evidence of record, and may state whether or not the Veteran's lay statements are supported by medical or other evidence.  The clinician may not dismiss the Veteran's statements about his symptoms and history solely because they are not documented in contemporaneous treatment records.

If the clinician determines that an additional examination is needed to provide the requested opinion, schedule an examination.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's DM disability is at least as likely as not ( at least an approximate balanced of positive and negative evidence) proximately due to, or aggravated by, the Veteran's service connected disabilities, including musculoskeletal disabilities (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability) and service connected psychiatric disability.  

The examiner must specifically address the following: 

(1) Did any the Veteran's service-connected disabilities or a combination of service-connected disabilities cause the Veteran to become obese or aggravate the Veteran's obesity?;

(2) If so, whether the obesity or aggravation of obesity as a result of service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the Veteran's DM; and

(3) Whether the Veteran's DM would not have occurred but for obesity caused or aggravated by service-connected disability.

The clinician may not dismiss the Veteran's statements about his symptoms and history solely because they are not documented in contemporaneous treatment records.

The clinician must also provide an opinion addressing whether the Veteran's DM is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) a result of his conceded in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

In providing the TERA opinion, the selected clinician must consider the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  He or she should specifically review and discuss August 2023, September 2024, and February 2025 VA memoranda identifying the TERAs.

A complete rationale must be provided in support of all opinions.

If the clinician determines that an additional examination is needed to provide the requested opinion, schedule an examination.  

3. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's hypertension is at least as likely as not related to or had its onset during his active service.  In providing this opinion, the clinician should specifically review the service treatment records and discuss potentially elevated blood pressure readings noted therein.

If a positive opinion as to direct service connection is not provided, obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's hypertension is at least as likely as not ( at least an approximate balanced of positive and negative evidence) proximately due to, or aggravated by, the Veteran's service connected disabilities, including musculoskeletal disabilities (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability) and service connected psychiatric disability.

4. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not related to or had its onset during his active service.  In providing this opinion, the clinician should specifically review statements, from the Veteran and from his former wife, which describe in-service symptoms of sleep disturbances (snoring, stopping breathing), poor sleep, fatigue, dry mouth, and swollen tongue.  

If a positive opinion as to direct service connection is not provided, obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not ( at least an approximate balanced of positive and negative evidence) proximately due to, or aggravated by, the Veteran's service connected disabilities, including musculoskeletal disabilities (a low back disability with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, a right knee disability, bilateral ankle disabilities, bilateral hip disabilities, a right wrist disability, and a right thumb disability) and service connected psychiatric disability.  

The examiner must specifically address the following: 

(1) Did any the Veteran's service-connected disabilities or a combination of service-connected disabilities cause the Veteran to become obese or aggravate the Veteran's obesity?;

The clinician must also provide an opinion addressing whether the Veteran's OSA is at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) a result of his conceded in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

In providing the TERA opinion, the selected clinician must consider the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  He or she should specifically review and discuss August 2023, September 2024, and February 2025 VA memoranda identifying the TERAs.
