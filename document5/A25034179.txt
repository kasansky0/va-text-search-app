REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1969 to December 1972.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 in February 2023 and elected the evidence submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with or within 90 days from receipt of the VA Form 10182.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the time period after the AOJ issued that decision and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182 or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Nevertheless, this decision represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal for the diabetes mellitus type II issue.  For the remaining issues decided herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Law and Analysis

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

A veteran who performed covered service shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  "Covered service" includes active military, naval, air, or space service performed in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975.  "Service in the Republic of Vietnam" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.  In such circumstances, service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases, including diabetes mellitus type II.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 U.S.C. § 1110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that secondary service connection is warranted under the causation standard of 38 U.S.C. § 1110 where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the nonservice-connected disability).  The Federal Circuit has held that 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) is inconsistent with 38 U.S.C. § 1110.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Diabetes Mellitus 

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II.

The Veteran has contended that he has the claimed disorder due to herbicide agent exposure while stationed on a patrol boat in the waters of Cam Rahn Bay in the Republic of Vietnam.  See, e.g., February 2023 written statement.

The AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran had covered service in the Republic of Vietnam during a time in which herbicide agent exposure is presumed as part of his assignment in Cam Rahn Bay (an in-service event), which is binding on the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  The record also supports that determination.  See, e.g., January 2022 VA memorandum; February 1970 to July 1970 service treatment records and February 1970 entry in record of transfers and receipts in service personnel records reflecting service location.

In addition, post-service evidence shows that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II.  The January 2022/September 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran had impaired fasting glucose, but that he did not meet the criteria for a formal diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.  In so doing, he listed three historical hemoglobin A1C (hereinafter A1C) levels dated from 2016 to 2021 in response to the diagnostic testing section of the examination report instructing that a diagnosis could be supported by an A1C of 6.5 percent or greater on two or more occasions.  The examiner also noted the Veteran's report that he had been diagnosed with the disorder since 2000 and that private and VA treatment records mentioned the disorder; however, he ultimately found that there were no recent diagnostics or records available to validate the diagnosis.

On the other hand, the treatment records establish that the Veteran has a long-standing diabetes mellitus type II diagnosis for which he takes medication.  For example, an April 2016 historical private treatment record shows that the Veteran established care with a new provider and reported having a history of diabetes for which he saw an endocrinologist in the past.  His A1C level was noted to be 6.3 when last checked the year prior.  The assessment was diabetes type II without complications with a plan for lab work and reassessment to see if he was able to adjust the A1C level with diet and exercise.  Thereafter, the same treatment provider started him on a diabetic medication regimen and continued the diabetes mellitus type II diagnosis.  See, e.g., historical private treatment records from October 2016, June 2017, July 2018, October 2019, and October 2020.  Notably, the Veteran submitted additional historical laboratory findings in February 2023 that support the diagnosis based on the A1C level information outlined in the January 2022 VA examination report. See private or VA laboratory results from 2007 to 2016 (all with A1C levels over 6.5).  As previously noted, the VA examination report had indicated that a diagnosis could be supported by an A1C of 6.5 percent or greater on two or more occasions, which is demonstrated by the treatment records submitted by the Veteran during the 90-day evidentiary record.

Similarly, when the Veteran historically established VA care in March 2015, the treatment provider added diabetes mellitus type II to his problem list, along with a notation of his current medications; the assessment reflects that the disorder was under good control.  An April 2017 historical VA treatment record shows that the Veteran believed that he had not been diagnosed with diabetes, but rather, he had glucose intolerance for which he took medications and did not check his blood sugars.  The assessment was glucose intolerance, and the treatment provider noted that she wondered if his primary outside doctor believed he had diabetes, as he was on the top dose of metformin and also on Januvia.  The plan was to add A1C to his next six-month lab work.  Thereafter, however, VA treatment records show ongoing lab work with a continued diabetes mellitus diagnosis with medication.  See, e.g., historical and current VA treatment records from November 2017, July 2018, August 2019, August 2020, August 2021, and August 2022.

Based on the foregoing and resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current diabetes mellitus type II diagnosis.  Thus, service connection for the disorder on a presumptive basis is warranted.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for left upper extremity, right upper extremity, left lower extremity, or right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

The Veteran has contended that he has the claimed disorders as complications of his now service-connected diabetes mellitus type II.  See December 2021 original compensation claim.

Nevertheless, the record shows that the Veteran has not had have current left upper extremity, right upper extremity, left lower extremity, or right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy since he filed his claim or within close proximity thereto.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013) and McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The January 2022/September 2022 VA examiner found that he did not have such disability on examination.  The treatment records support that determination, and the Veteran has not reported any current symptoms or functional impairment.  See, e.g., historical private treatment records from October 2019 and October 2020; VA treatment records from September 2021 (historical Agent Orange examination close in time to claim, Veteran denied any neuromuscular numbness, tingling, or weakness) and August 2022 (current treatment with first record showing normal diabetic foot examination; second record is upload of private treatment from that date that shows no focal neurological deficit observed and normal sensory, motor, and coordination observed).  Indeed, while not dispositive, the Veteran's argument submitted with the February 2023 VA 10182 only addressed the diabetes mellitus type II itself.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.  

Because the Veteran has not been shown have a current disability, no discussion of the remaining elements is necessary.  See Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection).  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the appeal is denied.
