ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for coronary artery disease (CAD) is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2023, for the grant of service connection for CAD is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's CAD has not resulted in a workload of 5.0 METs or less that results in heart failure symptoms.

2. During the period on appeal, at worst, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is at a Level I in the right ear and Level IV in the left ear.

3. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's diastolic blood pressure has not been predominantly 100 or more; his systolic blood pressure has not been predominantly 160 or more; and he has not had the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

4. There is no formal or informal claim of service connection for a heart disability prior to February 13, 2023.

5. The Veteran was not awarded service connection for CAD under the PACT Act; he was awarded service connection as due to herbicide exposure under 38 U.S.C. § 1116.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for CAD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005.

2. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103 (a), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.87, DC 6100.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.104, DC 7101.

4. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 13, 2023, for the award of service connection for CAD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1966 to November 1969, and from December 1972 to March 1989.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from November 2023 and December 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The November 2023 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral hearing loss; a noncompensable disability rating was assigned from February 13, 2023. The December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for CAD; a 30 percent disability rating was assigned from February 13, 2023. The December 2023 rating decision also granted service connection for hypertension; a noncompensable disability rating was assigned from August 10, 2022.

In his September 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran disagreed with the disability ratings assigned to his service-connected disabilities and the effective date assigned to his CAD; he selected the Hearing Review Lane.

In December 2024, the Veteran testified at a virtual hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge; a transcript of that hearing has been associated with the claims file. The Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions, the hearing testimony, and evidence submitted within 90 days after the hearing.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that in a February 19, 2025, independent medical opinion, the private physician stated that based on the marked impairments affecting the Veteran, it is likely that he would have difficulty competing for employment in the open labor market. However, the Board finds that the February 2025 private physician's statement does not warrant consideration of entitlement to a total disability rating for compensation based on individual unemployability (TDIU) in the context of his increased rating claims. See Rice v Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009). Notably, neither the Veteran nor his representative have contended unemployability or an intent to submit a TDIU claim. Additionally, the private physician's conclusory statement as to the likely effect of the Veteran's disabilities on his employability is not clear as to the extent or severity of the resulting interference, and the Board cannot equate this finding with preclusion of a substantially gainful occupation due to such symptoms. Moreover, even if the statement is taken on its face to assert preclusion of a substantially gainful occupation, the Board finds that this is inconsistent with the additional evidence of record, including the Veteran's testimony at the December 2024 Board hearing, as he indicated that he is still working at this time. As such, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU based on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities is not raised in the contest of the current appeal and need not be addressed further herein.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. All reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

While it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition in order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991); Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

In deciding the Veteran's increased evaluation claim, the Board has considered the determinations in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999) and Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007), and whether the Veteran is entitled to an increased evaluation for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for CAD

The Veteran seeks a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for his service-connected CAD with myocardial infarct, status post stent placement. The Veteran's CAD is currently rated as 30 percent disabling pursuant to DC 7005. The claim for an increased rating stems from the initial grant of service connection for CAD.

Effective November 14, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005. 86 Fed. Reg. 54089 (Sep. 30, 2021). As the period on appeals begins February 13, 2023, the old rating criteria for DC 7005 prior to the November 14, 2021, amendment is not applicable.

Effective November 14, 2021, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005, arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease) is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). Id. A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. Id. A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms. Id.

Under the post-amendment rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used. Id. 

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3). A level of 1-3 METs has been found to be consistent with activities such as eating, dressing, taking a shower, slow walking (2 miles per hour (mph)) for 1-2 blocks. A level of >3-5 METs has been found to be consistent with activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn (power mower), brisk walking (4 mph). A level of>5-7 METs has been found to be consistent with activities such as walking 1 flight of stairs, golfing (without cart), mowing lawn (push mower), heavy yard work (digging). A level of >7-10 METs has been found to be consistent with activities such as climbing stairs quickly, moderate bicycling, sawing wood, jogging (6 mph).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA heart conditions examination in August 2023. At the examination, the Veteran reported that he had a massive heart attack in 2019 and underwent stent placement; the condition has stayed the same since onset. The examiner noted that continuous medication was required for control of the Veteran's heart condition. There was no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac dilatation. Interview-based METs testing showed a METs of greater than 5 to 7, with symptoms of fatigue noted during activity. The examiner noted that the METs level was due solely to the heart conditions. The examiner found no functional impact due to the Veteran's heart condition.

The December 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for CAD; the 30 percent rating was assigned based on workload of 5.1-7.0 METs resulting in heart failure symptoms with the additional symptom of continuous medication required for control.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his heart problems are severe. He testified that since his heart attack in 2019, his stamina has been reduced; specifically, he has to sit down and take a break for his knees when walking long distances. He further testified that his physicians tell him to limit the amount of physical activity due to his heart problems; the last time he saw his physician, the Veteran was informed that everything is looking the way it should and to keep up what the Veteran was doing, which the Veteran attributed to his medication that he has been taking for about four years. The Veteran stated that he also has shortness of breath whenever he has to do strenuous activities and he is unable to do the things he used to be able to do, such as moving furniture and walking stairs.

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted an independent medical opinion. The physician noted review of the Veteran's claims file and opined that the Veteran's heart disability is consistent with a 60 percent rating. However, the physician did not provide a rationale to support this opinion; as such, the Board affords this opinion minimal probative value as the examiner provided very limited remarks without citing to medical evidence or diagnostic tests.

As shown in the VA examination, findings on interview and examination do not indicate the criteria for a rating higher than 30 percent under DC 7005, as set forth above.

The Veteran is competent to report what he experiences through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). For example, he reported dyspnea on exertion as a persistent symptom at the Board hearing and reported fatigue in his interview-based METs testing results noted in the August 2023 VA examination. However, DC 7005, although including dyspnea as a "heart failure symptom" among its criteria for higher ratings, further requires such a symptom as dyspnea to be in conjunction with other symptoms, such as a METs testing level at 3 to 5 or LVEF of 30 to 50 percent. Moreover, the more probative evidence of record, to include medical testing and expertise, does not indicate that the assignment of an initial evaluation in excess of 30 percent is warranted. In so finding, the Board notes that it weighed the lay and medical evidence and finds more probative opinions rendered by VA medical professionals given their expertise in evaluating cardiac disorders. As there is no contrary probative medical evidence favoring an increased disability rating CAD, the evidence is against an increased disability rating.

For these reasons and based on the evidence of record, the Board finds no approximate balance of the evidence to support a rating excess 30 percent for this stage of the appeal period.

The Board notes that it has considered whether the Veteran is entitled to an increased rating under any other diagnostic codes, aside from 7005, but it has found that none of the other diagnostic codes are applicable.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for CAD. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for bilateral hearing loss

The Veteran seeks a compensable disability rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss. The claim for an increased rating stems from the initial grant of service connection for hearing loss.

Evaluations of defective hearing range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled Maryland CNC speech discrimination test together with the average hearing threshold level measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

To evaluate the degree of disability from bilateral service-connected hearing loss, the schedule establishes 11 auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness. 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Tables VI and VII.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (a). In that situation, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Further, when the average pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the Roman numeral designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral, and that numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (b).

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss examination in August 2023. An audiogram showed his pure tone thresholds were:

	1000 Hz	2000 Hz	3000 Hz	4000 Hz

Right	50	60	50	65

Left	55	60	65	70

The pure tone threshold averages were 56.25 for the right ear and 62.5 for the left ear. Speech discrimination testing using the Maryland CNC word list yielded scores of 96 percent for the right ear and 84 percent for the left ear. The use of speech discrimination was indicated as valid and appropriate for rating purposes at that time. The Veteran reported functional impact as he is tone deaf in high frequencies and he has difficulty understanding speech.

Evaluating each ear separately, the Veteran's right ear does not show pure tone thresholds indicating an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment. Applying the above to Table VI results in a Level I Roman numeral designation for the right ear. The Veteran's left ear shows pure tone thresholds indicating an exceptional pattern of hearing impairment. Applying the above to Table VI results in a Level III Roman numeral designation for the left ear; applying the above to Table VIA results in a Level IV Roman numeral designation for the left ear, which is resultant of a higher numeral. Application of these findings to Table VII corresponds to a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, DC 6100.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he has worn hearing aids for approximately four years, and they help him hear; he is tone deaf on certain frequencies, and has difficulty hearing certain noises and voices; his symptoms have been getting worse.

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted an independent medical opinion. The physician noted review of the Veteran's claims file and opined that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability is consistent with a 30 percent rating. However, the physician did not provide a rationale to support this opinion; as such, the Board affords this opinion minimal probative value as the examiner provided very limited remarks without citing to medical evidence or diagnostic tests.

There are no other audiometric testing results for the remainder of the appeal period which comply with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 for rating purposes.

The Board has also reviewed and carefully considered the Veteran's contention that the severity of his service-connected bilateral hearing loss warrants a higher disability rating. Lay people are competent to report on matters observed or within their personal knowledge. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Therefore, the Veteran is competent to provide statements of symptoms which are observable to his senses. However, the Board must emphasize that the Veteran is not competent to interpret accurately clinical findings pertaining to the Veteran's hearing loss symptoms as this requires highly specialized knowledge and training. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(1). See also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, the statements provided do not contemplate a higher rating based on the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability.

Review of this record reveals that there is no basis to assign a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss based on the available audiological testing. Additionally, there are no findings suggestive of increased impairment or that suggest a higher rating could be assigned.

Disability ratings for hearing impairment are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992). In this case, as explained above, the numeric designations are such that an increased rating is not warranted, as described.

Here, while the Veteran contends that he is entitled to a higher rating, the evidence does not support his contentions. As such, a higher rating for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is not in order.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record is not in approximate balance. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension

As noted, in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for hypertension associated with herbicide exposure; a noncompensable rating was assigned effective from August 10, 2022.

The Veteran seeks a compensable disability rating for his service-connected hypertension. The Veteran's hypertension is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. The claim for an increased rating stems from the initial grant of service connection for hypertension.

Under DC 7101, a disability rating of 60 percent for hypertension requires diastolic blood pressure predominantly 130 or more. A rating of 40 percent requires diastolic blood pressure predominantly 120 or more. A rating of 20 percent requires diastolic blood pressure predominantly 110 or more or systolic blood pressure predominantly 200 or more. A rating of 10 percent requires diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

Where the criteria for a compensable rating under a diagnostic code are not met, and the schedule does not provide for a noncompensable rating, as in DC 7101, a noncompensable rating will be assigned when the required symptomatology for a compensable rating is not shown. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Per Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021), when a Veteran is receiving a noncompensable rating for hypertension, under DC 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal. The Board may factor the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication into its analysis of claims for increased ratings for hypertension because DC 7101 expressly mentions the effect of hypertension medications. See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 276-77 (2016).

Here, the Board observed that the Veteran takes medication to control his high blood pressure. The Board further observes that the Veteran's medical record contains numerous blood pressure readings taken during the course of the appeal and prior to the period on appeal. However, none of the readings reveal diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control to warrant a 10 percent evaluation.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that upon entrance to service, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 136/80 (systolic/diastolic) as noted at his February 1966 enlistment examination; and at the Veteran's October 1969 separation examination for his first period of active-duty service, his blood pressure reading was 136/72. Moreover, the Veteran's STRs for his second period of active-duty service shows his blood pressure reading appears to be 128/88 at his November 1972 enlistment examination (the Board notes that the blood pressure reading is illegible); and 138/88 at his February 1989 retirement examination. The Board notes that the Veteran's blood pressure was elevated at 138/90 on February 27, 1989, the physicians requested the Veteran return for a blood pressure check, which was 120/80 on February 28, 1989, and 138/88 on March 1, 1989. Additionally, at the February 1989 retirement examination, the Veteran was found qualified for retirement and to perform the duties of his rank/rate at sea and on foreign shores. There are other readings contained in these records, most of which do not show a diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic blood pressure predominantly 160 or more, or minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

Turning to the remaining record, the Veteran's private treatment records show that his blood pressure readings were 138/74 in July 2019; 126/70 in January 2020; 126/62 in October 2020; 128/68 in May 2021; and 128/78 in October 2022.

At an August 2023 VA heart conditions examination, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 115/68.

The Veteran was afforded a VA hypertension examination in August 2023, wherein a diagnosis of hypertension was confirmed (dated 1989). At the examination, the Veteran reported that he was noted to be hypertensive at service discharge in 1989, and the condition has improved since onset. The examiner reported that the Veteran's treatment plan includes taking continuous medication for hypertension (lisinopril, amlodipine, carvedilol, and HCTZ). At the time of the examination, the Veteran's blood pressure readings were 112/68, 115/72, and 115/68. The examiner noted that the Veteran does not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more; he also noted there was no functional impact.

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted an independent medical opinion. The physician noted review of the Veteran's claims file and opined that the Veteran's hypertension disability is consistent with a 10 percent rating. However, the physician did not provide a rationale to support this opinion; as such, the Board affords this opinion minimal probative value as the examiner provided very limited remarks without citing to medical evidence or diagnostic tests.

Based on a full review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the August 2023 examination report is adequate because it fully addressed rating criteria, included file review, and is fully responsive to the question at issue. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

The Board has also considered the Veteran's private and VA medical treatment records, including those preceding the period on appeal pursuant to Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021). They contain multiple blood pressure readings, as the Board listed above, but the majority of which do not show predominant diastolic pressure at 100 or more or systolic pressure at 160 or more.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's blood pressure readings fluctuate slightly over time; however, at no point during the appeal period do the records show that his blood pressure readings meet the schedular criteria for a compensable rating. The Veteran's hypertension is shown to be well-controlled by medication throughout the appeal period, and there is no argument or indication that the detailed evidence of record is an inaccurate representation of the severity of the Veteran's hypertension. In other words, the Board finds that the predominance of the Veteran's blood pressure readings supports the currently assigned noncompensable rating for a hypertension disability. The Veteran's diastolic blood pressure readings have predominantly been under 100 and systolic blood pressure readings have predominantly been under 160. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101. Further, the Board has acknowledged that the Veteran requires medication for control of his hypertension and has factored the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication into its analysis, which is permissible per McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 276-77 (2016).

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that his hypertension warrants an increased disability rating. Specifically, at the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he has taken medication for his blood pressure since 1989, and at that time he was informed that he was at the stroke level during his retirement physical due to his blood pressure readings. He further testified that the medication controls his hypertension now. The Board notes that the Veteran's claims file contains medical records prior to beginning medication in 1989. Specifically, his STRs, which contain elevated blood pressure readings in 1989, prior to service discharge; however, as noted, he was found fit for retirement, and there is no indication that the Veteran had other complaints of or treatment for hypertension during service. Further, the Board observes that hypertension is a complex disease process. As such, the Board is relying upon the medical findings available and finds them most probative. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Based on the above, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence is against a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is against assignment of a higher rating, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2023, for the grant of service connection for CAD

Effective Date

In assigning effective dates, the general rule is that, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement is the date the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria for the benefit. For continuously pursued or supplemental claims, the effective dates are governed by 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(h); but that is not the situation here. See also 38?C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Additionally, the Board does not find an Intent to File. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

As an exception to the general rule, for direct service connection, the effective date is the day after separation from service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year of separation from service; otherwise, the general rule applies. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i). The Board notes that the Veteran did not file a claim for CAD within one year of separation from service; therefore, this exception does not apply.

Where VA compensation benefits are awarded pursuant to a liberalizing change in the law or an administrative issue, the?effective date?of the award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of the liberalizing change in the law or VA issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5110?(g); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (p), 3.114(a). For a claimant to receive benefits dating back to the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue, the claim must be received within one year of the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a). Prior to March 24, 2015, informal claims were recognized. Any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more VA benefits may be considered an informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2017). An informal claim must identify the benefit sought. The Board does not find an informal claim here.

Analysis

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 13, 2023, for the grant of service connection for CAD. After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.

In support of the Board's conclusion, the Board reiterates that the effective date is determined by the date of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

As to the date of claim, the evidence shows that the Veteran first filed a claim of service connection for CAD on February 13, 2023. The December 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for CAD and assigned a 30 percent rating effective from February 13, 2023, which was said to be the date the claim was received. Service connection was granted on the basis of presumption due to herbicide exposure. As the Veteran appealed this decision, this claim remains pending and is currently before the Board. Accordingly, February 13, 2023, is the date of claim.

As to the date of entitlement, the Board notes that even if entitlement arose prior to February 13, 2023, this would be the later of the two dates. Therefore, as February 13, 2023, is the correct effective date, the Veteran is already in receipt of the earliest effective date available. Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date is denied.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was seeking entitlement to an effective date of August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for CAD. Notably, this is the date in which the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was signed into law. Claims that are granted under the PACT Act are entitled to an effective date of August 10, 2022. The claim must have been filed no later than August 10, 2023.

In this case, the Veteran filed his claim prior to the deadline under the PACT Act; however, his claim was not granted under the PACT Act. Therefore, he is not entitled to an effective date of August 10, 2022. Rather, the Veteran was granted presumptive service connection for CAD as due to herbicide exposure pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.309. Notably, he was presumed to have been exposed to herbicides based on the Veteran's nautical service in/on the Republic of Vietnam's inland waterways and one or more of the approved Republic of Vietnam bays or harbors. See July 2023 VA Memo. As it relates to herbicide exposure, the PACT Act merely expanded the presumption of in-service herbicide agent exposure to service in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Guam, American Samoa, and Johnston Atoll. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (d). There is no evidence that the Veteran had service in, or was exposed to herbicide agents, in any one of these locations. Additionally, there is no other basis from which the Veteran could have been granted service connection under the PACT Act. Therefore, an effective date based on the PACT Act is not warranted.

For the reasons outlined above, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record weighs against the claim. The Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claims, that doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, an effective date earlier than February 13, 2023, for the award of service connection for CAD is denied.
