REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2008 to October 2009.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in February 2024 and March 2024 by a VA Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).   In August 2024, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decisions by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a final initial matter, the Board observes that, in his August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he was also appealing claims for service connection for arthritis, erectile dysfunction, HSV, joint pain, and back pain; however, such issues had never been previously claimed or adjudicated. Therefore, such matters are not properly before the Board and will not be addressed herein.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Direct service connection may not be granted without evidence of a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.  Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

Where a veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, to a degree of 10 percent within one year, from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system.  Additionally, tinnitus is deemed an organic disease of the nervous system where there is evidence of acoustic trauma.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint.  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service.  Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992).  Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim.  However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that he currently has tinnitus as a result of in-service noise exposure.  As an initial matter, in the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ, as relevant, favorably found that he had a current diagnosis of tinnitus as shown at October 2023 and February 2024 VA examinations, and had a low probability of hazardous noise exposure and participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) coincident with his military occupational specialty (MOS) of food service specialist, which resulted in exposure to industrial solvents, chemicals, fuels, CARC paint, etc.  The Board is bound by such favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Therefore, the remaining inquiry is whether such current disorder is related to the Veteran's acknowledged in-service noise exposure and/or TERA. 

In this regard, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnoses referable to tinnitus.  Additionally, in an August 2009 Report of Medical History completed at the time of his separation, he denied experiencing ear trouble.  Furthermore, at the October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran stated that his tinnitus, which was intermittent and occurring once a month, had its onset in 2021, and the examiner opined that such disorder was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure.  In support thereof, she indicated that the onset of tinnitus was reported by the Veteran to be post-separation.  The examiner further indicated that there was no report of tinnitus in the STRs, at separation, or in the medical records until the time of the Veteran's claim, and the current literature did not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus.  

Moreover, at the February 2024 VA examination, while the Veteran reported that his tinnitus, which occurred approximately three days a month, had its onset in 2009 during AIT training, the examiner similarly opined that such disorder was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure.  In support thereof, she reported that the Veteran was in food services, which had a low probability of noise exposure.  The examiner further reported that, while the Veteran was exposed to some firearms during basic training and loud vehicles, a comparison of his entry and separation audiograms dated in June 2008 and June 2009 did not show a shift in hearing during service, and his STRs were silent for tinnitus.  Additionally, she noted that the Veteran had a VA examination a few months prior during which he reported that his tinnitus began in 2021, and now he reported that it began during service; however, his brief, intermittent tinnitus was not consistent with the persistent type associated with acoustic trauma, and no acoustic trauma was documented.  

Additionally, in a separate VA opinion later the same month, a different examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.  In support thereof, he noted that there was a lack of clear medical evidence that provided an indication of a relationship between the development of tinnitus and the TERA.  The examiner further noted that there was a lack of documentation to support complaints or ongoing treatment for such complaints in the STRs or at separation; and per the most recent VA examination, the onset of tinnitus was reported by the Veteran to be post-separation, without evidence of a report of tinnitus and records until the time of the claim. 

The Board affords great probative weight to the October 2023 and February 2024 VA examiners' opinions addressing the direct relationship between the Veteran's current tinnitus and his in-service noise exposure and TERA as such considered all pertinent evidence of record, to include the Veteran's statements and his relevant medical history, and provided complete rationales, relying on and citing to the records reviewed.  Moreover, the examiners offered clear conclusions with supporting data as well as reasoned medical explanations connecting the two.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A]medical opinion ... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").  Notably, there is no medical opinion to the contrary. 

The Board also considered the Veteran's assertions as to the etiology of his tinnitus; however, as a lay person, he does not have the requisite training and experience necessary to address such a complex medical matter.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).  In this regard, the etiology of such disorder involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship and, thus, may not be competently addressed by lay statements.  Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (explaining that while the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).  Accordingly, the Veteran's opinion as to the etiology of his tinnitus is not competent evidence and, consequently, is afforded no probative weight.

Furthermore, the evidence of record fails to demonstrate that tinnitus manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from the Veteran's active duty service in October 2009.  In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran's February 2024 report that his tinnitus had its onset in 2009 during AIT training to be not credible as such is contradicted by the remainder of the evidence, to include his own statements.  Specifically, his STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis referable to such disorder, and in his August 2009 Report of Medical History completed at the time of his separation, he denied ear trouble.  Further, during his October 2023 VA examination conducted a few months previously, he reported that his tinnitus had its onset in 2021.  Thus, due to the inconsistency of the Veteran's statements, and the lack of any supporting contemporaneous evidence, the Board finds that he is not an accurate historian regarding the onset of his tinnitus.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995) (VA adjudicators may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the veteran in weighing evidence).  Rather, the first indication of such disorder was noted in connection with the Veteran's September 2023 claim and diagnosed at the October 2023 VA examination.  Moreover, as such chronic disease was not "noted" in service, presumptive service connection for such disorder cannot be established based on a continuity of symptomatology.  See Savage v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 488, 495 (1997). Consequently, presumptive service connection for tinnitus is not warranted.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that tinnitus is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty.  Thus, service connection for such disorder is not warranted.

In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the weight of the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus, such doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that he currently has bilateral hearing loss as a result of his in-service exposure to gunfire.  While his STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis referable to bilateral hearing loss, audiometric testing conducted in July 2008 and June 2009 revealed normal hearing acuity, and he denied currently or previously experiencing hearing loss in June 2008 and August 2009, the AOJ favorably found that he was exposed to hazardous noise in service as evidenced by his MOS as a food service specialist, which has a low probability to noise exposure.  The Board is bound by such favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

However, at no time during the pendency of the claim does the Veteran have a current disability of bilateral hearing loss as defined by VA regulations, and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  In this regard, as noted previously, his STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis pertinent to hearing loss, and there are no post-service treatment records on file prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  Furthermore, at a February 2024 VA examination, pure tone thresholds in decibels at the tested frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz were 5, 10, 5, 10, and 10 in the right ear, and 10, 10, 5, 15, and 15, in the left ear, respectively, and the Veteran's speech discrimination score was 100 percent in both ears.  Notably, at such time, he indicated that his hearing was fine. Moreover, while the Veteran is competent to report symptoms, he is not competent as a lay person to diagnose hearing loss as defined by VA as such requires the administration and interpretation of audiometric testing.  Jandreau, supra; Woehlaert, supra.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current disability of bilateral hearing loss at any time proximate to his claim.  See McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra.  Thus, where, as here, there is no probative evidence indicating that the Veteran has the disability for which service connection is sought, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Brammer, supra.  Consequently, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. 

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the weight of the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to service connection for GERD.

4. Entitlement to service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae.

5. Entitlement to service connection for psoriasis.

The Veteran has claimed service connection for GERD, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and psoriasis related to his military service; however, his STRs are negative for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis referable to GERD and, while his STRs reflect diagnoses of pseudofolliculitis barbae and psoriasis, to include a notation of psoriasis on his scalp and bilateral ears following an abnormal clinical evaluation of his skin at his August 2009 Report of Medical Examination at the time of his separation, he has not identified evidence demonstrating a current disability or described persistent or recurrent symptoms of such disorders.  

In this regard, as noted previously, there are no post-service treatment records on file prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, and the Veteran did not identify any outstanding treatment records relevant to the instant claims.  Indeed, on his September 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ), such provides a blank treatment section in which he could provide pertinent information regarding any treatment he received after his discharge for his claimed disabilities in a free-text format; however, he did not do so.  Rather, the Veteran noted "N/A."  Similarly, there was no indication that he received any pertinent treatment at a VA medical facility as, in September 2023, a search of the Dallas, Texas, VistA electronic records system returned a result of "No progress notes found." 

Moreover, the Veteran, as a lay person, is not competent to diagnose GERD, pseudofolliculitis barbae, or psoriasis as such requires the administration and interpretation of clinical evaluations and diagnostic testing, and he has not reported functional impairment of earning capacity associated with any symptoms.  See Jandreau, supra; Woehlaert, supra.  Accordingly, the Veteran's opinion as to the presence of such disabilities is not competent evidence and, consequently is afforded no probative weight. 

In this regard, the Board has considered whether there was a pre-decisional duty to assist error in regard to the AOJ's determination not to afford the Veteran a VA examination and/or opinion in connection with the instant claims.  However, at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, there was no indication that he had a current diagnosis of GERD, pseudofolliculitis barbae, or psoriasis, and the Veteran's generalized lay statements that he had such disorders related to his military service were insufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in providing a VA examination and/or opinion.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010) (if there is no credible evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, VA is not required to provide a medical examination); Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010) (a mere conclusory generalized lay statement that a service event or illness caused the Veteran's current disorder is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination).

Consequently, the Board finds that at no time during the pendency of the claim does the Veteran have current disabilities of GERD, pseudofolliculitis barbae, or psoriasis, and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of such disabilities prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  Thus, where, as here, there is no probative evidence indicating that the Veteran has the disability for which service connection is sought, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Brammer, supra.  Accordingly, service connection for the Veteran's claimed disorders is not warranted.  

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, as the weight of the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claims for service connection for GERD, pseudofolliculitis barbae, and psoriasis, such doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal and his claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
