ORDER

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 100 percent for prostate cancer for the period from November 20, 2017, to February 1, 2019, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for prostate cancer on or after February 1, 2019, is denied.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for type II diabetes mellitus is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to November 20, 2017, for the grant of service connection for prostate cancer is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 4, 2014, for the grant of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus type is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  From November 20, 2017, to February 1, 2019, the Veteran was in receipt of the maximum schedular evaluation available for prostate cancer.

2.  Since February 1, 2019, the Veteran's prostate cancer has been in remission without any local recurrence of metastasis, and the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that he has any urinary leakage, urinary frequency, or renal dysfunction.  He has also not been shown to have post void residuals greater than 150 cc; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc/sec); recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; or stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months.

3.  The Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus requires a restricted diet and an oral hypoglycemic agent, but the disability does not require insulin or a regulation of activities.

4.  The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a prostate disorder in February 2014, but he was not diagnosed with prostate cancer until November 20, 2017.

5.  In a December 2010 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied a claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of its issuance.

6.  Following the December 2010 rating decision, the Veteran first filed an application to reopen the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus on February 4, 2014.  He did not file another claim after January 1, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  An evaluation in excess of 100 percent for prostate cancer for the period from November 20, 2017, to February 1, 2019, is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

2.  The criteria for a compensable evaluation for residuals of prostate cancer on or after February 1, 2019, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

3.  The criteria for an initial evaluation in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

4.  The criteria for an effective date prior to November 20, 2017, for the grant of service connection for prostate cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.156, 3.160, 3.400.

5. The criteria for an effective date prior to February 4, 2014, for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116A, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.156, 3.160, 3.400, 3.816.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1967 to December 1969.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in January 2023 and elected to have a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  

A hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in December 2024.  A transcript of that proceeding has been associated with the claims file.

The Board notes that the Veteran has other separately docketed appeals, which will be addressed in other decisions.  The Board notes that the Veteran and his representative have raised the issue of entitlement to TDIU. See e.g., January 2023 VA Form 10182; December 2024 hearing transcript.  In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a claim for TDIU is part and parcel of an increased rating claim when such a claim is raised by the record.  However, during the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that he had last worked two years earlier in 2022, and as previously noted, this appeal stream stems from a January 2022 rating decision.  Therefore, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU is not at issue in this particular appeal stream.  However, the issue of entitlement to TDIU will instead be addressed in a separately docketed appeal stream.

Law and Analysis

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues decided herein.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Increased Evaluation

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Prostate Cancer

The Veteran is currently assigned a 100 percent evaluation effective from November 20, 2017, and a noncompensable evaluation effective from February 1, 2019, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

VA amended some of its criteria for rating genitourinary diseases and conditions effective November 14, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 54081 (September 30, 2021). However, consideration under the revised schedular criteria should not be undertaken before such criteria became effective.  The effective date rule contained in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) prevents the application of a later, liberalizing law to a claim prior to the effective date of the liberalizing law.  That is, for any date prior to November 14, 2021, neither the AOJ nor the Board could apply the revised rating schedule.

Where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the Veteran.  In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation.  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. The Board must apply both the former and the revised versions of the regulation for the period prior and subsequent to the regulatory change, but an effective date based on the revised criteria may be no earlier than the date of the change.  As such, VA must consider the claims pursuant to the former and revised regulations during the course of this appeal. See VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, for malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system, a 100 percent rating is assigned for active malignancy.  After six months following the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedure, if there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, the disability is to be rated on residuals, as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528 and note.

Voiding dysfunction is rated based on urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding.  Urinary leakage involves ratings ranging from 20 to 60 percent and contemplates continual urine leakage, post-surgical urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, or stress incontinence.  A 20 percent rating contemplates leakage requiring the wearing of absorbent materials, which must be changed less than 2 times per day.  When there is leakage requiring the wearing of absorbent materials, which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day, a 40 percent disability rating is warranted.  When these factors require the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day, a 60 percent evaluation is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

For urinary frequency, a 10 percent evaluation is assigned for daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or awakening to void two times per night.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night.  A 40 percent rating is contemplated for daytime voiding interval less than one hour or; awakening to void five or more times per night. 

Obstructed voiding includes ratings ranging from noncompensable to 30 percent.  A noncompensable rating contemplates obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilatation 1 to 2 times per year.  A 10 percent rating contemplates marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post-void residuals greater than 150 cubic centimeters (cc's); (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc's per second); (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months.  A 30 percent rating contemplates urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization.

Where the schedule does not provide a zero percent rating for a diagnostic code, a zero percent rating shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a higher initial evaluation for his service-connected prostate cancer.

For the period from November 20, 2017, to February 1, 2019, the Veteran has already been assigned a 100 percent evaluation for the disability, which is the maximum schedular evaluation available.  Accordingly, a higher evaluation is not warranted during that time period.

The Board also notes that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528, contain a temporal element wherein a 100 percent disability rating ceases, by operation of law, following a six-month convalescence period which starts upon the conclusion of cancer treatment.  See Tatum v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 443 (2014) (determining that the 100 percent rating under Code 7528 is authorized for six months following treatment for cancer followed by a disability rating for treatment for residuals of cancer).  Therefore, the rating decrease from 100 percent to 0 percent was not a "rating reduction," per se, as that term is commonly understood.  See Rossiello v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 430 (1992), (where the Court found that a 100 percent rating for mesothelioma ceased to exist by operation of law because the applicable Diagnostic Code involved contained a temporal element for that 100 percent rating).  Accordingly, the rating reduction provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.343 and 3.344 do not apply. See also Love v. McDonough, 106 F.4th 1361, 1368-70 (Fed. Cir. 2024); Foster v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 338, 345-46 (2021).

Nevertheless, the Board has considered whether the Veteran is entitled to a compensable evaluation for his service prostate cancer since February 1, 2019.  However, the evidence does not show that there no local reoccurrence or metastasis of his prostate cancer since the most recent treatment for active malignancy.  Nor has he required surgical, x-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedures since February 1, 2019.  In fact, a January 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran underwent external beam radiation and cryoablation of the prostate in July 2018 and that his prostate cancer has been in remission.  During the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran also acknowledged that he did not have any recurrence of the cancer or any subsequent chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.

The evidence also does not show that the disability requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 times per day.  Although the January 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran has a voiding dysfunction due to prostate cancer treatment, he specifically indicated that the voiding dysfunction does not cause urine leakage, which would require the use of absorbent material.  Private treatment records dated in June 2021 also documented that he was voiding well and reported no incontinence, and the Veteran denied the use of absorbent materials during the December 2024 hearing.

The evidence also does not show that the Veteran has a daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or that he awakens to void two times per night. In fact, the January 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran does not have increased urinary frequency, and the June 2021 private treatment records show that there was no increased frequency.

The Board does acknowledge the Veteran's December 2024 hearing testimony that he has to use the bathroom two to four times per night and more frequently during the daytime, which he attributes to his prostate cancer treatment.  However, as previously noted, the contemporaneous evidence does not show that he had such symptomatology during the appeal period.  His testimony also contradicts his own earlier reports.  Indeed, he reported that he did not have increased frequency in June 2021. See June private treatment records.  Thus, the Board finds that the evidence does not persuasively show that the Veteran met the criteria for a compensable evaluation based on urinary frequency during the appeal period.  If the Veteran believes that his disability has since worsened or increased in severity, the Board takes this opportunity to advise him that he may file a new claim for an increased evaluation, as any reported worsening since the January 2022 rating decision on appeal would not trigger a pre-decisional duty to assist error to obtain a more recent examination.

In addition, the evidence does not show that the Veteran has marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post-void residuals greater than 150 cubic centimeters (cc's); (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc's per second); (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months.  The January 2022 VA examiner did note that he had hesitancy, a slow and weak stream, and decreased force of stream; however, he specifically found that the Veteran did not have post-void residuals greater than 150 cubic centimeters (cc); uroflowmetry peak flow rate less than 10 cc/second); recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; or stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months.  There was also no urinary retention requiring catheterization.  In addition, private treatment records show that the Veteran did not have difficulty urinating in June 2021, and he denied having any urinary tract infections or catheter during the December 2024 hearing.

Moreover, there is no indication that the Veteran has any renal dysfunction.  In fact, the January 2022 VA examiner indicated that there was no renal dysfunction due to the service-connected disability.  The Veteran also denied having any kidney dysfunction during the December 2024 hearing.  The Board has also considered that revisions to the rating criteria; however, the amended rating criteria in effect since November 14, 2021, do not impact this case because he does not meet the threshold of having renal dysfunction or chronic kidney disease.  Thus, the revised criteria used to evaluate such impairment do not materially affect the outcome of this appeal.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not persuasively show that the Veteran has met the criteria for a compensable evaluation on or after February 1, 2019.  Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

Diabetes Mellitus

The Veteran is currently assigned a 20 percent evaluation for his service-connected diabetes mellitus, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913.

Under 7913, a 20 percent disability evaluation is assigned for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin and restricted diet; or an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet.   A 40 percent disability evaluation is contemplated for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities.  A 60 percent disability evaluation is warranted for diabetes mellitus requiring insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities, with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated.  A 100 percent evaluation is contemplated for diabetes mellitus requiring more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities) with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated.

The Court has held that, in order to demonstrate a regulation of activities, "medical evidence" is required to show that both occupational and recreational activities have been restricted.  Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 364 (2007).  The phrase "regulation of activities" means "avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities."  Camacho, 21 Vet. App. at 362 (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913).

Successive rating criteria, such as Diagnostic Code 7913, is where the evaluation for each higher disability rating includes the criteria of each lower disability rating, such that if a component is not met at any one level, the veteran can only be rated at the level that does not require the missing component.  Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 156 (2009).  For example, the diagnostic code for diabetes mellitus (Diagnostic Code 7913) is successive because each higher evaluation requires the elements of the lower evaluation: the 10 percent evaluation requires a restricted diet; the 20 percent evaluation requires a restricted diet and insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent; the 40 percent evaluation requires insulin, a restricted diet, and regulation of activities; and so forth.  Camacho, 21 Vet. App. at 366.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an increased evaluation for his service-connected diabetes mellitus.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus has required an oral hypoglycemic agent and a restricted diet, but not a regulation of his activities.  In fact, the January 2022 VA examiner indicated that the disability is managed by a restricted diet and oral hypoglycemic agents, but does not require insulin or regulation of activities.  There were also no hospitalizations over the last 12 months, complications, or functional impact due to diabetes mellitus.  

Moreover, during the December 2024 hearing, the Veteran testified that he is on a restricted diet, but he stated that he has not been prescribed insulin or told to avoid exercise to manage his diabetes mellitus.  Nor do the treatment records document such restrictions.  To the contrary, the VA treatment records show that regular exercise, such as frequent walking, was recommended to help manage the disorder.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's type II diabetes mellitus required an oral hypoglycemic agent and a restricted diet, but not a regulation of activities.  As stated in Camacho, the phrase "regulation of activities" means "avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities."  21 Vet. App. at 362.   The evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's occupational and recreational activities were restricted by any medical provider.  Therefore, the Veteran has not been shown to have met the criteria for an increased evaluation under the rating criteria.  Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The effective date based on the submission of new and material evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (q)(2), 3.400(r).  It is settled law that the effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) ("the Court thus holds that the effective date statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monthly benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").  In the Sears case, the Court explained that the statutory framework did not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim. The Court explained that the term, new claim, as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the former regulations prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Prostate Cancer

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date prior to November 20, 2017, for the grant of service connection for prostate cancer.

The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for a prostate disorder in February 2014, which the AOJ denied in a March 2014 rating decision based on a finding that there was no current disability.  The Veteran perfected an appeal to the Board, which remanded the case in October 2021.  Thereafter, in the January 2022 rating decision on appeal, AOJ granted service connection for prostate cancer effective from November 2017, which corresponds to the date of a biopsy confirming a diagnosis of prostate cancer.  

Given that the February 2014 claim remained pending, the crux of this case is the date entitlement arose.  The term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found." DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that VA receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

In this case, VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran had been told that he had an elevated PSA and requested a consultation with a urologist in March 2017.  However, he was not diagnosed with prostate cancer until a biopsy was performed on November 20, 2017. See November 2017 biopsy report; January 2022 VA examination report.  Indeed, Dr. W.B. (initials used to protect privacy) provided a July 2021 letter in which he also stated that the Veteran was first diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 20, 2017, and other private treatment records documented a reported onset in 2018.  

The Board notes that the diagnosis of prostate cancer involves internal medical processes and requires diagnostic testing.  Although there may have been or concerns about the possibility of prostate cancer, the available evidence does not show a diagnosis of prostate cancer until November 20, 2017.  Indeed, the Veteran's private physician has indicated that he was diagnosed on that date.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement did not arise until the Veteran was diagnosed with prostate cancer on November 20, 2017.  Accordingly, an earlier effective date is not warranted, and the appeal is denied.

Diabetes Mellitus

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date prior to February 4, 2014, for the grant of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus.

The Veteran had submitted an informal claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus in June 2010, which the AOJ denied in a December 2010 rating decision.  The Veteran was notified of that decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence within one year thereafter.  Therefore, the December 2010 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103

Following the December 2010 rating decision, the Veteran first filed an application to reopen the claim on February 4, 2014.  In the January 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for type II diabetes mellitus under 38 U.S.C. § 1116A effective from the date of that claim.  

The BWN Act was passed on June 25, 2019, and was made effective on January 1, 2020.  The BWN Act created a new statute codified at 38 U.S.C. § 1116A, which provides that a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served offshore of the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent unless there is affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A(b).  The BWN Act also provides for special effective date rules for claims where service connection is sought for diseases presumed service-connected in veterans exposed to herbicide agents that were denied on lack of service in the Republic of Vietnam and are now able to be granted based on such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A(c)(2).  Specifically, an earlier effective date is potentially warranted under the BWN Act if a veteran submitted a claim for disability compensation between September 25, 1985, and before January 1, 2020, for a covered disease that was denied because it was not established that the disease was incurred or aggravated by service and also submitted a claim for disability compensation on or after January 1, 2020, for the same condition covered by the prior claim, which is approved pursuant to the BWN Act. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A (c)(2)(B); VAOPGCPREC 3-2019 (Dec. 13, 2019).  If such conditions are met, the Secretary shall determine the effective date of an award by treating the date on which the veteran filed the prior claim as the date on which the veteran filed the claim so awarded under 38 U.S.C. § 1116A. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A(c)(2)(A).

In this case, the Veteran did file a claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus between September 25, 1985, and before January 1, 2020.  However, he did not file another claim on or after January 1, 2020.  Thus, the criteria under 38 U.S.C. § 1116A for the exception to the general effective date rules do not apply in this case.  The Board also notes that the AOJ sent a letter to the Veteran in October 2019 advising him of the passage of the BWN Act and specifically advised him that he could submit a supplemental claim, VA Form 20-0995, to have his previously denied claim reviewed under the new law.  He was also informed that the claim would not be reviewed if he did not submit such a claim.  However, the Veteran and his representative did not respond to that letter or submit a supplemental claim.

The Board also finds 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(c) is not applicable in this particular case, as there is no indication that VA denied compensation for diabetes mellitus in any decision issued between September 25, 1985, and May 3, 1989.  

In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran's representative made a general assertion that there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the prior rating decision.  However, he was advised during the hearing that such a claim would have to be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the December 2010 rating decision became final and that a formal or informal claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus was not received prior to the claim submitted on February 4, 2014, which is the effective date currently assigned. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied.

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that February 4, 2014, is the earliest possible effective date for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus under the governing laws and regulations.
