ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as proximately due to service connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The weight of the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is proximately due to his service connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as proximately due to service connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) most recently addressed in a March 2018 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal [and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window]. In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as proximately due to service connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood

The Veteran seeks service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Entitlement to service connection may be established on a secondary basis where there is evidence of (1) a current, non-service-connected disability, (2) a current service-connected disability, and (3) evidence that the non-service-connected disability is either (i) proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disability or (ii) aggravated (increased in severity) beyond its natural progression by a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 446 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The October 2023 rating decision on appeal reflects the favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with OSA, and that service connection is in effect for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood ("adjustment disorder"). 

The Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the record, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal. Although there is an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence as deemed appropriate and the analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim.

In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2023. The September 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran is obese, and that his OSA is more likely than not the result of his obesity. 

Obesity per se is not a "disease" or "injury" for purposes of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. However, where a service-connected disability causes a Veteran to become obese; the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing another disability; and when the other disability would not have occurred but for the obesity caused by the initial service-connected disability, the other disability may be service connected on a secondary basis. VAOPGCPREC 1-2017.

The September 2023 VA examiner did not address whether the Veteran's obesity is proximately due to or aggravated by another service connected disability. 

In February 2023 the Veteran submitted an opinion by a private medical provider (M.B.) who opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA is the result of his obesity which was, in turn, the result of his service connected adjustment disorder. M.B.'s opinion was supported by discussion of medical literature showing an association between acquired psychiatric disabilities and weight gain, to include patterns of excessive caloric intake associated with acquired psychiatric disabilities. 

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is in at least approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's OSA is proximately due to his service connected adjustment disorder. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as proximately due to adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood have been met, and the same is hereby granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.
