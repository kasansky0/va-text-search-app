ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for aid and attendance and/or housebound status is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the appellant had a diagnosis of ED at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The appellant's service-connected disabilities did not render him sufficiently helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, nor did they require him to remain in bed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for ED are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and/or housebound status are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(l) and (s); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.351, and 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Army from July 1978 to February 1988. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

These matters come before the Board on appeal from a June 2020 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a March 2019 (SMC) and an August 2019 rating decision (ED) of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance, SMC based on housebound, and service connection for erectile dysfunction.  In June 2021, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing the June 2020 HLR rating decision to the Board, and requesting the Board's Evidence Submission Review docket.

Of significant note, the Board is aware that the appellant was subsequently granted entitlement to service connection for unspecified depressive disorder, secondary to his service-connected back pain, and assigned a 70 percent disability rating, effective from November 14, 2017, in an April 2020 rating decision.  However, as this disability was not service connected during the period of review for the SMC claims (prior to the March 2019 rating decision), it will not be considered as part of the SMC analysis herein.

Evidentiary Windows

As the appellant selected Evidence Submission Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative with the NOD (VA Form 10182) or within 90 days following receipt of the NOD. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 303. If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and VA's receipt of the NOD, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following VA's receipt of the NOD. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is denied.

The appellant contends that he suffered from ED related to his military service during the period on appeal. See VA Form 21-526EZ, July 16, 2019. 

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal connection between the disease or injury in service and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Analysis

The initial question for the Board is whether the appellant had a current disability during the period on appeal. A thorough review of the record revealed no evidence of ED anytime during the appeal period beginning with the appellant's claim in July 2019. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Moreover, the appellant did not have a current diagnosis of ED and was not diagnosed with ED at any time during the pendency of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321. 

While the appellant believed he had a diagnosis of ED, he is not competent to provide such diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. See Jandreau, supra. As there was no current diagnosis of ED during the period on appeal, the criteria for service connection are not met. There can be no valid claim for entitlement to service connection if the evidence does not support a current disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110.

Given the foregoing, the claim for ED must be denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance and/or housebound status is denied.

The appellant contends that he is entitled to SMC based on aid and attendance and/or housebound status. See VA 21-2680, December 21, 2018. 

Applicable Law

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), SMC is payable if, as the result of service-connected disability, a veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a), the following factors will be accorded consideration in determining whether a veteran is in need of regular aid and attendance of another person: the inability of the veteran to dress or undress himself, or to keep himself ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which, by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without such aid; inability of the veteran to feed himself because of the loss of coordination of upper extremities or because of extreme weakness; and the inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the Veteran from the hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment.  38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

It is not required that all the disabling conditions enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a) be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which a veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his condition as a whole.  It is only necessary that the evidence establish that a veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there is a constant need.  38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a); see also Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996) (holding that at least one factor listed in section 3.352(a) must be present for a grant of SMC based on need for aid and attendance).

Analysis

At the time of the March 2019 rating decision on appeal, the appellant was service-connected for splenectomy rated as 30 percent disabling, lumbosacral strain rated as 20 percent disabling, tinnitus rated as 10 percent disabling, and hemorrhoids, nephrolithiasis, trigeminal neuralgia, and bilateral hearing loss rated as noncompensable.  See Rating Decision-Codesheet, March 20, 2019.  The combined total rating was 50 percent from July 27, 2017. Id. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), a veteran is eligible for SMC for the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, loss of one hand and one foot, blindness in both eyes, and/or being permanently bedridden as a result of a service-connected disability. Here, the evidence of record does not demonstrate that the appellant has an anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, loss of one hand and one foot, blindness in both eyes, and/or is permanently bedridden.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l), a veteran is afforded SMC for being with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. As discussed further below, the evidence of record does not support a finding that the appellant had such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance.  

A thorough review of private treatment records from the period on appeal reflect that the appellant was seen regularly for his back disability and reported difficulty sitting, standing, walking, bending, lifting, pushing, pulling, cooking, cleaning, washing his back, putting on his shoes and socks, and working because of back pain. See Private Treatment Record, January 11, 2018; Private Behavioral Assessment, December 18, 2018; Private Vocational Assessment, December 19, 2018; Independent Medical Examination, December 21, 2018. However, the record indicates the appellant was able to complete activities of daily living, such as shaving and showering on his own. See Private Treatment Record, July 10, 2018 (the appellant reported "that his current pain management and plan allows him to more easily get through his day and complete his activities of daily living"). A December 2018 private examination revealed no ankylosis, atrophy, decreased muscle strength, abnormal gait, or the use of assistive devices. See Independent Medical Examination, December 21, 2018. Additionally, during a private behavioral assessment, the appellant was found to be competent in his mental capacity to control and manage his finances. See Private Behavioral Assessment, December 18, 2018. 

In December 2018, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21-2680, Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance, which was completed by a private physician. In the section for the diagnoses that equate to the level of assistance described in the report, the physician noted severe back pain and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. Unfortunately, this VA Form 21-2680 does not support a finding that the appellant is in need of regular aid and attendance of another person. 

First, the clinician explicitly included limitations due to a non-service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. For example, the clinician noted the appellant was unable to stand longer than 10 minutes because his legs felt weak and unstable due to numbness and tingling. Therefore, the assessment is of limited probative value because it is not always clear which disabilities contribute to the alleged limitations in performing activities of daily living. 

Second, although the clinician indicated the appellant is unable to prepare his own meals because he is unable to lean forward for more than 10 minutes, the clinician indicated the appellant is able to feed himself. As the Board interprets the regulation, the ability to feed himself does not require that a claimant be able to cook but is satisfied if the appellant can prepare meals (whether prepared or otherwise not requiring cooking (e.g., sandwiches, cereal, etc.).

Third, in response to whether the appellant needs assistance in bathing and tending to other hygiene needs, the clinician noted that the appellant is unable to wash his back, bend over without severe pain, and must prop his legs on something to put on his shoes and socks. The physician provided no independent assessment, but merely reported the appellant's own assessment. See LeShore v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 406, 409 (1995) (lay statements "simply recorded by a medical examiner" do not constitute "competent medical evidence").

Finally, the clinician indicated that the appellant is not legally blind; did not require nursing home care; did not require medication management; is able to manage his own financial affairs; is able to leave the house whenever necessary; and did not require aids such as canes, braces, crutches, or the assistance of another person for locomotion. 

During the March 2019 VA back examination, the appellant reported that he could not bend or lift. See VA Back Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), March 14, 2019. He reported taking a cruise and experiencing back pain the entire trip. The clinician indicated abnormal range of motion, with pain noted at forward flexion, extension, right lateral flexion, left lateral flexion, right lateral rotation, and left lateral rotation. The clinician noted tenderness in the middle of the appellant's lumbar spine. The clinician noted the appellant did not use any assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion. No atrophy, ankylosis, or intervertebral disc syndrome and episodes requiring bed rest were noted. Additionally, the clinician indicated that there was no functional impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis due to his service-connected back condition. 

The Board is sympathetic to obvious difficulties the appellant experienced due to his service-connected back disabilities. However, the private treatment records do not demonstrate that the appellant was in need of regular aid and attendance of another person during the period on appeal. Although the appellant believes SMC is warranted because of his service-connected back disabilities, he does not have the knowledge or education or experience to provide such an opinion in these matters as this is an issue that is not within the knowledge of a lay person. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (The veteran's own lay assertions as to the onset and etiology of the [condition] does not constitute competent evidence, as he lacks medical training or credentials). 

The weight of the evidence is persuasively against finding that the appellant was so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person. His service-connected disabilities did not result in the need for regular assistance to perform any of the activities listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a). Additionally, the record indicates the appellant ambulated, and otherwise was able to leave his bed and his house daily. See VA Form 21-2680, December 21, 2018; VA Back Condition DBQ, March 14, 2019. 

The appellant also did not meet the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), which requires that he have "a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound." See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i) (setting forth criteria for SMC at the housebound rate). At the time of the March 2019 rating decision, the appellant did not have any service-connected disability rated as total, nor had he been awarded a total disability rating based on individual unemployability. Further, the record demonstrates that the appellant left his home frequently.  His total combined rating was 50 percent. As such, he did not meet the criteria for SMC based on housebound status.

It is noted that throughout the period on appeal, the appellant reported radiating pain, as well as lower extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness. The Board is sympathetic to the appellant's pain and struggles with bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. However, at the time of the March 2019 rating decision, he was not service connected for a lower extremity disability. 

In conclusion, based on foregoing reasons, the appellant is not entitled to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance or housebound status. The evidence is not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim. Therefore, there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the appellant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). As such, entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance or housebound is denied.
