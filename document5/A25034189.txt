REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant, Aegis Sciences Corporation, is a non-VA healthcare provider who rendered services to the Veteran on December 31, 2020, January 4, 2021, January 10, 2021, January 18, 2021, January 21, 2021, January 25, 2021, and February 1, 2021.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1703(c),(h).  

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from determinations made by a VA Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that denied payment of the expenses of non-VA medical services provided by the appellant on December 31, 2020, January 4, 2021, January 10, 2021, January 18, 2021, January 21, 2021, January 25, 2021, and February 1, 2021.

In a June 7, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

With regard to the issues denied below, the Board is not denying any matter on appeal based on any disputed factual matter, but rather on the basis that the appellant is not entitled to payment as a matter of law.

Legal Criteria

In general, non-VA care and medical services that will be paid for by VA through the Veterans Community Care Program must be authorized in advance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 17.4020.  The Board takes notice that the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) provide that testing for Covid-19 should be free to the patient, as long as the federally declared public health emergency is in effect.  The FFCRA states that coverage must be provided without prior authorization or other medical management requirements. Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Pub. L. No. 116-127, 134 Stat. 178 (2020).

The Board also notes that prior to January 1, 2021, to expedite Covid-19 testing and services for Veterans, VA decided in 2020 to temporarily reimburse all Covid-19 testing, even those without a VA referral.  After January 1, 2021, claims for reimbursement for Covid-19 testing must be approved by way of VA referral or meet the criteria for emergency eligibility requirements to receive payment.  

The Board takes notice that the Office of Community Care lists their current reimbursement policy for Covid-19 testing claims for eligible veterans. On Community Care's "Covid-19 Guidance for Community Providers" webpage, it specifically states that Veterans may be tested for Covid-19 and paid for by VA when the Veteran meets specific criteria as described by CDC and are enrolled in VA health care or otherwise be eligible for VA care.  The VA will reimburse community providers for Covid-19 testing of eligible Veterans at in-network urgent care locations, in-network community care network providers, if referral or authorization exists, and emergency departments if the visit meets the criteria for VA coverage of emergency care services.  See Covid-19 Guidance for Community Providers, Community Care, Health Care, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/providers/COVID-19_Guidance.asp (last updated April 7, 2025).

1. Entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on December 31, 2020

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on December 31, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the December 31, 2020, medical services.  In an August 2022 Report of Contact, the AOJ advised the Veteran that the appeal for medical services provided on December 31, 2020, by the appellant was approved after secondary administrative review.  The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy.  

The administrative action for the entire December 31, 2020, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.? No determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.? 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d).

2. Entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on January 4, 2021

The AOJ denied payment for the non-emergency medical services of diagnostic COVID-19 testing furnished by?the appellant?on January 4, 2021, pursuant to?38 U.S.C. § 1703, on the basis that such services had not been authorized by VA as was required for payment.  In a January 2021 Explanation of Payment, the appellant was notified that no authorization number was submitted on the claim, which was a billing requirement for pre-approved care.  The appellant was instructed to resubmit the claim with the authorization number, if approved.  

The appellant appealed in June 2021, asserting that the services for COVID-19 testing were medically necessary and generally referencing the FFCRA and the CARES Act and guidance issued by the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of the Treasury.  The provider asserted that, in essence, the laws mandated that VA pay the full amount requested by Aegis Sciences Corporation of expenses of a COVID-19 test.

An undated Report of Contact noted that, upon further review, no authorization was found and the decision was upheld.  In addition, the Board finds that the record is negative for the Veteran having received the medical services as part of an emergent event.

7. Entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on February 1, 2021

The AOJ denied payment for the non-emergency medical services of diagnostic COVID-19 testing furnished by?the appellant?on February 1, 2021, pursuant to?38 U.S.C. § 1703, on the basis that such services had not been authorized by VA as was required for payment.  In a February 2021 Explanation of Payment, the appellant was notified that no authorization number was submitted on the claim, which was a billing requirement for pre-approved care.  The appellant was instructed to resubmit the claim with the authorization number, if approved.  

The appellant appealed in June 2021, asserting that the services for COVID-19 testing were medically necessary and generally referencing the FFCRA and the CARES Act and guidance issued by the Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of the Treasury.  The provider asserted that, in essence, the laws mandated that VA pay the full amount requested by Aegis Sciences Corporation of expenses of a COVID-19 test.

A March 2022 Report of Contact noted that, upon further review, no authorization was found and the decision was upheld.  In addition, the Board finds that the record is negative for the Veteran having received the medical services as part of an emergent event.

Here, the COVID-19 testing services provided by Aegis Sciences Corporation on January 4, 2021, January 10, 2021, January 18, 2021, January 21, 2021, January 25, 2021, and February 1, 2021 were not emergency treatment and not authorized by VA, and the appellant has not argued otherwise. 

As the COVID-19 diagnostic testing on January 4, 2021, January 10, 2021, January 18, 2021, January 21, 2021, January 25, 2021, and February 1, 2021was provided after January 1, 2021, the announced Community Care Program policy is inapplicable.  Therefore, relevant VHA policy was that prior approval of the COVID-19 related services was needed for testing on the above dates.

?

To the extent that the appellant argues that VA should retroactively authorize payment, or should have authorized payment previously, the appellant is contesting a VA decision regarding whether to furnish services to a veteran through a non-VA provider under 38 U.S.C. § 1703(d) and/or (e).  However, such decisions are statutorily barred from being appealed to the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 1703(f) ("The review of any decision under subsection (d) or (e) shall be subject to the Department's clinical appeals process, and such decisions may not be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals").  As the Board has no authority to review these contentions, they provide no legal basis for reimbursement.

As discussed above,?38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4010?and 17.4020(a) explicitly require VA authorization of non-VA medical services for VA payment of such services.  As there was no VA authorization of the January 4, 2021, January 10, 2021, January 18, 2021, January 21, 2021, January 25, 2021, and February 1, 2021, non-emergency?COVID-19 testing services performed by?the appellant, which the appellant does not dispute, there is no legal basis for VA payment of such expenses.  Accordingly, the appellant's claim for payment of the expenses of such services must be denied.  See Sabonis v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?426, 430?(1994).
