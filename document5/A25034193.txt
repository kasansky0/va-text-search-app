ORDER

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

It is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is attributable to his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1990 to May 1991, to include service in Southwest Asia. His decorations include the Southwest Asia Service Medal.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD))) in August 2024, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the AOJ rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

The Veteran seeks to establish service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. He contends that the condition is directly related to service. Alternatively, the record suggests that the condition is secondary to his service-connected disabilities.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Under applicable law, disability which is due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall also be service connected. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

Although service connection is not allowed for obesity on its own, obesity can act as an "intermediate step" to establish service connection for another disability as secondary to an already service-connected disability under certain circumstances. See VAOPGCPREC 1-2017. The VA General Counsel has indicated that establishing service connection in a case such as the Veteran's requires resolution of three issues: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether the obesity due to the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the claimed disability; and (3) whether the claimed disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. Id.

In a more recent decision, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims modified the analysis set out in the General Counsel's opinion, holding that in considering whether obesity is an "intermediate step," consideration must be given to whether obesity was caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability, consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the September 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and that he is service connected for PTSD. The Board is bound by those favorable determinations, and they are not in dispute. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Accordingly, the first and second elements of secondary service connection, as to the presence of a current disability and a service-connected disability, has been established.

As to the question of nexus, the Veteran submitted a July 2023 private evaluation from N.K,. MSN, APRN, FNP-C. The examiner opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea was secondary to his service-connected psychiatric disorder by way of the intermediate step of obesity. The opinion was based on review of the Veteran's medical history and is supported by a clear rationale. As such, the opinion is probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

A VA medical opinion had previously been obtained in an effort to assess the etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea. In August 2023, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD was not the cause of his sleep apnea; and that "although a correlation between PTSD and sleep apnea has been made, there is insufficient evidence to support a causative relationship between Veteran's claimed condition of sleep apnea and service-connected condition of PTSD." 

Here, the August 2023 examiner was not asked to address, and did not address, the question of whether the Veteran suffered from obesity, whether obesity was caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities and, if so, whether obesity was a substantial factor in causing the sleep apnea and whether sleep apnea would not have occurred but for obesity caused or aggravated by service-connected disabilities. In addition, in arriving at her conclusions, while the August 2023 examiner provided some reasoning as to why it was less likely than not that the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused by PTSD, the examiner's rationale was lacking inasmuch as it failed to explicitly address the question of aggravation. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

On review of the record, the Board is satisfied that the requirements for an award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea have been met. The evidence, at a minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt on the matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The appeal is granted.
