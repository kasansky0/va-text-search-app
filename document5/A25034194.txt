ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a neck condition is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a neck disability or neck condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left shoulder condition began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right ankle disability or right ankle condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for lumbosacral strain are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for neck condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for a left shoulder condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for a right ankle condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1986 to March 1998.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his many years of honorable service to our country.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a March 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  The evidence must show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for lumbosacral strain.

There is no dispute that the Veteran has a current lumbosacral condition and that the Veteran sustained a back injury in service.

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with a lumbosacral sprain and that the Veteran's January 1995 service treatment records show treatment for back pain.  See March 2022 Rating Decision.

Therefore, the question before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current lumbosacral sprain and his in-service incurrence of back pain.

The Veteran has had two VA examinations for a back condition, in March 1998 and in January 2022.

The March 1998 VA examiner noted that "[the Veteran] strained his back in 1989 lifting a heavy item in the office.  He is bothered occasionally with low back pain and stiffness.  He uses Motrin for the pain on an as needed basis."  See March 1998 VA Examination.  The examiner also found that "Curvature of the lumbar spine is normal.  There is no functional limitation of range of motion due to pain."  Id.  The examiner concluded by noting that imaging showed mild dextro-rotoscoliosis of the mid-lumbar spine.  Disc spaces appear normal.  Soft tissues are unremarkable.  Impression: mild scoliosis."  Id.  The examiner found regarding the Veteran's in-service back injury that "one time treatment in service was acute and transitory and resolved with no disabling residuals."  Id. 

The January 2022 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with lumbosacral strain.  See January 2022 VA Examination.  However, after conducting an in-person examination and reviewing the Veteran's VA e-folder the examiner opined that the Veteran's current back condition is less likely than not related to his service.  Id.  As rationale the examiner reiterated the previous examiner's finding that "one time treatment in service was acute and transitory and resolved with no disabling residuals" adding that "there is a PCP visit dated 12-13-2021 and 10-8-2015 where he complains of back pain but no evidence of back pain between the years of 1998 and 2015 in the medical record."  Id.  

The Board finds that the March 1998 and the January 2022 VA examinations are adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiners were not competent or credible, and as the reports are based on the Veteran's statements, review of the relevant evidence of record and the examiners' observations, the Board finds they are entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008).

The Board notes that the Veteran has provided lay statements regarding both his symptoms of back pain and medical treatment he sought for his back symptoms between 1998 and 2015.  See February 2021 VA Form 21-4138.  Specifically, the Veteran has stated that he has continued to experience back pain since service in varying degrees of severity, to include "over 7 annual episodes that require going back to bed" and that he has "gone to the doctor several times over the years and even had a chiropractor in Rochester, NY between 2001-2005."  Id. 

Here, the Board notes that the Veteran has been provided authorizations for release of private medical treatment, and that the Veteran has authorized the release of private medical records from Rochester, NY dating between 2001-2005 but these do not include or mention treatment for a back condition or chiropractic treatment generally.  See, e.g., October 2014 VA Form 21-4142. 

The Board emphasizes that lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

The Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran's lay statements regarding his back pain and back symptoms.  Again, there is no dispute that the Veteran experienced a back injury in 1995 while serving active duty and there is no dispute that the Veteran currently is diagnosed with lumbosacral strain.  Instead, the issue is that the competent medical evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's current back condition-diagnosed over 25 years after the Veteran injured his back in service- was either incurred in service or caused by the specific back injury the Veteran sustained in service.

No theory of secondary service connection has been raised by either the record or by the Veteran's contentions.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to service connection for his back condition, he does not possess the medical expertise required to provide an opinion as to the etiology of the currently diagnosed lumbosacral strain.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The persuasive weight of the evidence of record is simply against a finding that the Veteran's current back condition had its onset during the Veteran's period of qualifying service or that it was caused or aggravated by another service-connected disability.  Service connection is therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d), 3.307, 3.309.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However-as the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim and the evidence is not in approximate balance-the doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, the Veteran's appeal must be hereby DENIED.

2. Entitlement to service connection for neck condition is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a neck condition.

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded that the Veteran's October 1989 service treatment records show that the Veteran received treatment for a neck injury.  See March 2022 Rating Decision.

The Board notes that the March 2022 rating decision lists a second favorable finding which reads "You have been diagnosed with a disability.  On January 20, 2022 you were diagnosed with left shoulder strain on January 2022."  Id.  The Board finds that this statement is a typographic error, because it is a verbatim copy-and-paste repeat of a favorable finding for the Veteran's unrelated claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability.  The Board is therefore not bound by this favorable finding as it relates to the Veteran's neck condition. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c).  

In other words, there is no dispute that the Veteran has a separate claim for service connection for a left shoulder disability, and that the Board is bound by the favorable finding that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed left shoulder disability as it relates to his left shoulder claim, but the copy-and-paste inclusion of this favorable finding under the Veteran's neck condition claim is a typographical error.

The next question before the Board is therefore whether the Veteran has a current neck disability or neck condition.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there is no valid claim of service connection.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at any time during the pendency of a claim-or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current neck disability and has not had a neck disability or persistent or recurring symptoms of a neck disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran received a VA examination for his neck in January 2022.  The examiner found that "the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis" of a neck condition.  See January 2022 VA Examination.  Specifically, the examiner found that "for the claimant's claimed condition of Neck Condition there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis."  Id.  

The examiner noted that the Veteran reported that his "neck pain began in 1988.  He has intermittent neck pain.  He uses Tylenol for pain relief."  Id.  The examiner also conducted active and passive range of motion testing and found that the results were normal, found no evidence of pain upon examination, noted that the Veteran did not report flare-ups, and noted that the Veteran did not report functional loss or functional impairment.  Id. 

The Board finds that the January 2022 VA examination is adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiner was not competent or credible, and as the report is based on the Veteran's statements, review of the relevant evidence of record and the examiners' observations, the Board finds it is entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008).

The Veteran's claim for service connection for a neck condition was originally inferred by the RO after the Veteran had filed a July 2014 claim for several different service connected disabilities.  See January 2015 Rating Decision.

The only medical evidence of record showing a neck injury, or symptoms related to the neck, is the Veteran's October 1989 service treatment records which show that the Veteran received treatment for a neck injury.  See October 1989 Service Treatment Records.

Although the court in Romanowsky did not specify an exact timeframe definition for disability or symptoms "recent to" the filing of a claim, as explained above the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for a neck condition in July 2014, 25 years after the last contemporaneous documentation of the Veteran experiencing a neck injury or symptoms related to the neck.  See January 2015 Rating Decision.  The Board finds that even a generous interpretation of the requirement for a disability, or disability symptoms, to be present "recent to" the filing of a claim does not stretch to encompass this case where the last evidence of the disability is over two decades before the claim was filed. 

Here the Board notes the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). 

The Board also notes Veteran's lay statements regarding his neck pain, including that his neck "is constantly stiff" and that the Veteran reports "well over 10 episodes a year where I can't turn my head much."  See February 2021 VA Form 21-4138.  The Board emphasizes that lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

However, there is simply no evidence of record to suggest that, at any time either recent to the Veteran's July 2014 filing of a claim for service connection for a neck condition or any time since that the Veteran has experienced neck pain reaching "the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1356.  Instead, the Veteran has affirmatively denied any functional loss or functional impairment related to his neck condition.  See January 2022 VA Examination.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to service connection for a neck condition, he does not possess the medical expertise required to provide a diagnosis or an opinion as to the etiology of his claimed condition.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The competent evidence of record is simply against finding that the Veteran has any neck injury or condition.

As the threshold element of a service connection claim (a current disability) has not been met, service connection for a neck condition must be denied.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However-as the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims and the evidence is not in approximate balance-the doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, the Veteran's appeal must be hereby DENIED.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder condition is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for left shoulder injury residuals.

As an initial matter: after reviewing the evidence of record, and in light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for left shoulder injury residuals to encompass any left shoulder condition.

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded that that the Veteran's July 1996 service treatment records show treatment for a left shoulder strain, and that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with a left shoulder strain.  See March 2022 Rating Decision. 

Therefore, the question before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current left shoulder strain and his in-service left shoulder injury.

The Veteran has had two VA examinations for his left shoulder, in March 1998 and in January 2022.

The March 1998 VA examiner noted that the Veteran "sustained an injury to the left shoulder in a sports event in the military.  This did not require surgery.  There was no evidence of a fracture, and he is bothered periodically with pain in the shoulder joint.  He has occasional stiffness of this shoulder joint."  March 1998 VA Examination.  The examiner found upon examination that "the left shoulder reveals a little discomfort on movement, but he has a normal range of motion and there is no functional limitation of range of motion due to pain.  Forward elevation is to 180 degrees.  Abduction is to 180 degrees.  Internal rotation is to 90 degrees."  Id.  The examiner conducted imaging of the Veteran's shoulder and found that the imaging was "normal."  Id.  The examiner found regarding the Veteran's July 1996 in-service treatment for left shoulder strain that "one time treatment in service was acute and transitory."  Id.

The January 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left shoulder strain and noted that the Veteran reported that "he began having shoulder pain in 1996.  He has intermittent left shoulder pain.  He uses Tylenol for pain relief."  January 2022 VA Examination.  However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's current left shoulder strain is less likely than not incurred in or caused by his in-service shoulder injury.  Id.  As rationale, the examiner explained that Per rating decision dated 5-19-1998 " 'On 7-8-96 he was seen for complaints of left shoulder pain times 2 days secondary to exercise. The assessment was left shoulder strain. No complaints or findings were noted on physical examination dated 6-12-97.  On VA examination dated 3-25-98 he complains of periodic pain and occasional stiffness in the shoulder joint.  On physical examination range of motion was normal and there was no functional limitation of range of motion due to pain. X-ray of the shoulder was normal.  One time treatment in service was acute and transitory and resolved with no residual disability noted on VA examination.' There is a PCP visit dated 10-8-2015 where he complains of left shoulder pain but no evidence since that time of left shoulder pain and no evidence between the years of 1998 and 2015 in the medical record. Nexus is not established."  Id. 

The Board finds that the March 1998 and the January 2022 VA examinations are adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiners were not competent or credible, and as the reports are based on the Veteran's statements, review of the relevant evidence of record and the examiners' observations, the Board finds they are entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008).

The Board notes the Veteran's lay statements regarding his left shoulder, specifically that the Veteran reports he feels "pain every time I attempt to lift something with the focus on my left shoulder or attempt to throw a ball. The pain is severe as if I've just gotten punched in the shoulder."  See February 2021 VA Form 21-4138.  

The Board emphasizes that lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

The Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran's lay statements regarding his left shoulder pain and left shoulder symptoms.  Again, there is no dispute that the Veteran sustained a left shoulder sprain in 1996 while serving active duty and there is also no dispute that the Veteran currently is diagnosed with a left shoulder sprain.  Instead, the issue is that the competent medical evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran's current shoulder condition-diagnosed over 25 years after the Veteran strained his shoulder in service- was either incurred in service or caused by the specific shoulder injury the Veteran sustained in service.

No theory of secondary service connection has been raised by either the record or by the Veteran's contentions.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to service connection for his left shoulder condition, he does not possess the medical expertise required to provide an opinion as to the etiology of the currently diagnosed left shoulder sprain.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).    The persuasive weight of the evidence of record is simply against a finding that the Veteran's current left shoulder condition had its onset during the Veteran's period of qualifying service or that it was caused or aggravated by another service-connected disability.  Service connection is therefore not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d), 3.307, 3.309.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However-as the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim and the evidence is not in approximate balance-the doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, the Veteran's appeal must be hereby DENIED.

4. Entitlement to service connection for residuals, right ankle sprain is denied. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for right ankle sprain residuals.

As an initial matter: after reviewing the evidence of record, and in light of Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has recharacterized the issue of service connection for right ankle sprain residuals to encompass any right ankle condition.

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded that the Veteran's service treatment record show that the Veteran was treated for a right ankle sprain in October 1989.  See March 2022 Rating Decision.

The next question before the Board is therefore whether the Veteran has a current right ankle disability or right ankle condition.

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there is no valid claim of service connection.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at any time during the pendency of a claim-or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current right ankle disability and has not had a right ankle disability or persistent or recurring symptoms of a right ankle disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran has received two VA examination for his right ankle, in March 1998 and in January 2022.

The March 1998 VA examiner noted that "when [the Veteran] was in the military around 1989 he had a sports injury to the right ankle. He used a cast for six weeks. He has not had surgery on the ankle.  He tells me that at times he gets a little pain in the joint.  He is not bothered with swelling of the joint."  March 1998 VA Examination.  The examiner further noted upon examination that "the right ankle is not deformed.  There is no functional limitation of range of motion due to pain. Dorsiflexion is to 10 degrees.  Plantar flexion is to 45 degrees."  Id.  The examiner conducted imaging of the Veteran's right ankle and found that the imaging was "normal."  Id.  The examiner did not find any specific diagnosis.  Id. 

The January 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran reported that "he injured his right ankle in 1989.  He has intermittent right ankle pain.  He uses Tylenol for pain relief."  January 2022 VA Examination.  However, the examiner concluded "he has a normal exam today and no diagnosis is rendered."  Id.  The examiner conducted active and passive range of motion testing and found that the results were normal, found no evidence of pain upon examination, noted that the Veteran did not report flare-ups, and noted that the Veteran did not report functional loss or functional impairment.  Id. 

The examiner specifically addressed the Veteran's in-service right ankle sprain, noting "per rating decision dated 5-19-1998 'On 10-23-89 he was treated for a right lateral malleolus strain and placed in a cast.  X-ray was negative for fracture or dislocation. The diagnosis was right ankle sprain.  On 11-6-89 the cast was removed.  No complaints or findings were noted on physical examination dated 6-12-97. On VA examination dated 3-25-98 he complained of a little pain in the joint, but denied swelling. Physical examination revealed no evidence of deformity or functional limitation of range of motion due to pain. Range of motion was normal. X-ray of the ankle was normal. Treatment in service was acute and transitory and resolved with no residual disability found on VA examination.' He has a normal exam today and no diagnosis is rendered. There is a PCP visit dated 10-8-2015 where he complains of right ankle pain but no evidence since that time of right ankle pain and no evidence between the years of 1998 and 2015 in the medical record. Nexus is not established."  Id. 

The Board finds that the March 1998 January 2022 VA examinations are adequate for appellate review.  There is no evidence that the examiners were not competent or credible, and as the reports are based on the Veteran's statements, review of the relevant evidence of record and the examiners' observations, the Board finds they are entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-05 (2008).

The Veteran first filed a claim for a right ankle condition in March 1998.  See May 1998 Rating Decision.

The only medical evidence of record showing a right ankle injury, or symptoms related to the right ankle, is the Veteran's October 1989 service treatment records which show that the Veteran received treatment for a right ankle sprain injury.  See October 1989 Service Treatment Records.

Although the court in Romanowsky did not specify an exact timeframe definition for disability or symptoms "recent to" the filing of a claim, as explained above the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for a right ankle condition in March 1998, 9 years after the last contemporaneous documentation of the Veteran experiencing a right ankle injury or symptoms related to the right ankle.  The Board finds that even a generous interpretation of the requirement for a disability, or disability symptoms, to be present "recent to" the filing of a claim does not stretch to encompass this case where the last evidence of the disability is 9 years before the claim was filed. 

Here the Board notes the Federal Circuit's holding in Saunders v. Wilkie, that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). 

The Board also notes Veteran's lay statements regarding his right ankle, including that her has "to wrap my right ankle every time I exercise or run. It gets very sore when I walk or run too much, and I can twist it very easily."  See February 2021 VA Form 21-4138.  The Board emphasizes that lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

However, there is simply no evidence of record to suggest that, at any time either recent to the Veteran's March 1998 filing of a claim for service connection for a right ankle condition or any time since that the Veteran has experienced ankle pain reaching "the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1356.  Instead, the Veteran has affirmatively denied any functional loss or functional impairment related to his right ankle condition.  See January 2022 VA Examination.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he is entitled to service connection for a right ankle condition, he does not possess the medical expertise required to provide a diagnosis or an opinion as to the etiology of his claimed condition.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The competent evidence of record is simply against finding that the Veteran has any right ankle injury or condition.

As the threshold element of a service connection claim (a current disability) has not been met, service connection for a right ankle condition must be denied.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However-as the persuasive evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims and the evidence is not in approximate balance-the doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, the Veteran's appeal must be hereby DENIED.
