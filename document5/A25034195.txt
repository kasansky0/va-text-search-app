ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for hiatal hernia (GERD with eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal stricture, previously rated as eosinophilic esophagitis with esophageal stricture) from February 13, 2023 is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's hiatal hernia (GERD with eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal stricture) more nearly approximated symptom combinations productive of recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent for hiatal hernia (GERD with eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal stricture) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § § 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.21, 4.27, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1989 to August 2013. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claims or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is against the claims, in which case, the claims are denied. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

The Board has reviewed all evidence in the claims file, with an emphasis on the evidence relevant to this appeal. Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons or bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Board will summarize the relevant evidence as appropriate, and the analysis will focus on what the evidence shows as it relates to this specific claim. The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).

Entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for hiatal hernia (GERD with eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal stricture, previously rated as eosinophilic esophagitis with esophageal stricture) from February 13, 2023 is granted.

Disability Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule). The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where service connection has already been established and increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of the disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). However, in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999), it was held that evidence to be considered in the appeal of an initial assignment of a disability rating is not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder. The Court also discussed the concept of the "staging" of ratings, finding that, in cases where an initially assigned disability evaluation has been disagreed with, it was possible for a Veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disabilities in reaching its decision. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991). The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

In this case, the Veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). The Veteran is also competent to report symptoms of his hiatal hernia (GERD with eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal stricture) (hereafter GERD). See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). The Veteran is competent to describe his GERD symptoms and their effects on employment and/or daily activities. 

During the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected GERD is rated at 10 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code 7399-7346. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. This 10 percent rating has been in effect since February 13, 2023 (date the intent to file claim was filed). The Veteran contends he is entitled to a higher evaluation for GERD for the entire appellate period because the condition impacts his daily life more than the current evaluations would indicate. See March 2025 Appellate Brief, at 1.

When an unlisted condition is encountered, such as GERD, it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. According to the policy in the Rating Schedule, when a disability is not specifically listed, the Diagnostic Code will be "built up," meaning that the first 2 digits will be selected from that part of the schedule most closely identifying the part of the body involved, and the last 2 digits will be "99." 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. For example, Diagnostic Code 7399 is used to identify unlisted "miscellaneous" digestive system disabilities.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or "esophageal reflux" is defined as a condition involving regurgitation of the contents of the stomach into the esophagus, and possibly into the pharynx, with symptoms of burning pain and acid taste. See Stedman's Medical Dictionary 1520 (26th ed. 1995).

Prior to May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7346 (similar or analogous to GERD) provided that a 10 percent rating for hiatal hernia is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent rating of less severity. A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A 60 percent rating is warranted where there are symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

The terms "severe impairment of health" and "considerable impairment of health" are not defined in the Rating Schedule; rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. The Board notes the term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." See Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012).

With respect to the phrase "persistently recurrent," the Board notes that generally the word "persistent" is defined as existing for a long or longer than usual time or continuously; thus, the Board finds that the phrase persistent recurrent refers to symptoms that reoccur for continuously for a long period of time. See MERRIAM-WEBSTER, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/persistent.

Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing. See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 587 (31st ed. 2007). 

Pyrosis is defined as heartburn. Id., at 1587.

Hematemesis is defined as the vomiting of blood. Id., at 842.

Melena is defined as the passage of dark-colored feces stained with blood pigments or with altered blood. Id., at 1142.

In assigning a rating under Diagnostic Code 7346, the ameliorative effects of medication may not be considered. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). Additionally, the rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating. See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006). However, the Board notes that the rating criteria associated with the 30 percent rating are phrased in the conjunctive. See Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334, 337 (1991) (the use of the conjunctive "and" indicates that all the conditions listed must be met). Thus, for a 30 percent rating persistently, recurrent epigastric distress; dysphagia; pyrosis; regurgitation; and substernal or arm or shoulder pain must be shown (emphasis added).

The Board notes that the rating criteria for evaluating the Digestive System were amended effective May 19, 2024. As noted above, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. Therefore, the amended rating criteria will not be discussed in the present case as that is outside the appeal period.

Upon complete review of the appellate record, the probative evidence of record supports a higher initial 30 percent rating for the Veteran's GERD by analogy under Diagnostic Code 7399-7346 (hiatal hernia). 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The appeal is granted. In making this determination regarding a higher 30 percent rating, the Board has considered both the competent and credible medical and lay evidence of record. Specifically, the medical and lay evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's GERD exhibits persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346 (hiatal hernia). 

Turning to the medical evidence, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and severity of his GERD in May 2023. Here, the Veteran was diagnosed with GERD, stricture of esophagus, and eosinophilic esophagitis. See May 2023 C&P, at 2. The VA examiner noted symptoms of reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance 4 or more times per year, nausea 4 or more times per year, as well as esophageal stricture amenable to dilation. Id., at 3-4. The VA examiner's written narrative stated that the Veteran is limited in tasks of standing and leading a team as a functional impact of esophageal conditions. Id., at 7.

The Board also considered the Veteran's lay statements submitted in a February 2023 Statement in Support of Claim. Here, the Veteran indicated that "I have multiple symptoms of GERD including heartburn with acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, a feeling like there is a lump in my throat, and nighttime choking due to regurgitation every other day. I must use over the counter Tums and Rolaids a few times a week to help control the heartburn. I have also been prescribed Nexium and Pantoprazole. I must avoid certain foods, like coffee, soda, orange juice, and salsa, tomato, garlic which all worsen my symptoms. I cannot eat late in the day or night otherwise my regurgitation is worse. Due to my GERD symptoms, I require sleeping with multiple pillows propping my head up to fall asleep and even then, I find that I am not able to sleep more than 5 straight hours due to being awakened from my GERD symptoms. Due to my lack of sleep, I have noted that I have daytime fatigue, mood changes, low libido and sex drive, irritability, frequent yawning, difficulty enjoying social events and interactions, and self-neglect in personal care. I have been told by my provider that I have eosinophilic esophagitis with esophageal stricture." See February 2023 VA 21-4138, at 1. 

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's lay statements that the disability is worse than currently evaluated and those statements have been considered. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). As the Veteran's lay statements are consistent with the medical treatment records on file, the Board finds the Veteran credible and gives his Statement in Support of Claim significant probative weight. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

For the reasons stated above, the evidence supports a 30 percent rating for GERD for the entire appellate period. In this regard, the evidence showed that the Veteran experienced epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, substernal pain, nausea, sleep disturbance, eosinophilic esophagitis, and stricture of the esophagus. 

In granting a higher rating, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements regarding his symptoms as well as the evidence provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal. 

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

In light of the foregoing and after resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that an initial rating of 30 percent for GERD from February 13, 2023 is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. The appeal is granted.
