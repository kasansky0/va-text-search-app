ORDER

An earlier effective date of August 24, 1992, for the grant of service connection for headaches, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On August 24, 1992, VA received the Veteran's original claim of entitlement to service connection for headaches.

2. Service treatment records received in December 1993 and September 1996 constitute relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when the RO first decided the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of August 24, 1992, for the grant of service connection for headaches, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.156(c), 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1989 to September 2009.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that decision, the RO granted an earlier effective date of November 19, 2010 for the grant of service connection for headaches. 

In September 2024, VA received the Veteran's 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, as this is a Direct Review appeal, the record closed as of the July 2024 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence.

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307.  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch, the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case, less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after discharge from service.  Otherwise, for an award based on an original claim, claim reopened after a final disallowance, or claim for an increased rating, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Effective March 24, 2015, claims are required to be filed on standard forms, thus eliminating constructive receipt of claims and informal claims.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  This case involves dates prior to March 24, 2015, so the regulations in place prior to that date are applicable and are referred to in this section.

A "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p) (2014).  A claim for VA compensation must generally be in the form prescribed by the VA Secretary.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  Any communication or action, however, received from the claimant, or certain specified individuals on the claimant's behalf, that shows intent to apply for a benefit, and identifies that benefit, may be considered an informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

In cases involving new and material evidence, where evidence other than service department records is received within the relevant appeal period or prior to the issuance of the appellate decision, the effective date will be as though the former decision had not been rendered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(1).  In cases where the evidence is received after the final disallowance, the effective date is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2).  There is no basis for a freestanding earlier effective date claim from matters addressed in a final rating decision.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

Generally, the effective date of service connection based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

Here, the Board must determine whether 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is applicable for assigning an earlier effective date based upon VA's subsequent receipt of service department records.  It states, "Notwithstanding any other section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 19, 2010, for the grant of service connection for headaches

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than November 19, 2010, for the grant of service connection for headaches.  Specifically, the Veteran asserts that the proper effective date is August 24, 1992.  See January 29, 2025, Third Party Correspondence.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), a final decision will be reconsidered when "relevant official service department records" that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim.  Specifically, 

where a claim has been denied due to lack of evidence of an in-service injury, but later is granted based all or in part on subsequently acquired service records establishing the in-service injury and a nexus between the in-service injury and a current disability, the Veteran is entitled to a retroactive evaluation of the disability to assess the proper effective date the date of the original claim or the date entitlement otherwise arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c); Vigil v. West, 22 Vet. App. 63, 66-67 (2008).  In this sense, the claim is not just re-opened; it is reconsidered, and the date VA received the previously decided claim serves as the date of the claim, and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted.  Id. 

An exception pertains to records that VA could not have obtained when it first decided the claim because the records did not exist, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information for VA to identify and obtain the records from the respective service department, the Joint Services Records Research Center (as of May 2020 the VBA Records Research Center (RRC), or from any other official source.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2).

The record shows that VA received, and associated with the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) in December 1993 and September 1996.  See December 8, 1993, STR; see also September 4, 1996, STR - Medical.

Of note, prior adjudicatory documents regarding the Veteran's headaches, to include an October 1993 rating decision, referenced the unavailability of the Veteran's STRs.  At that time, the RO noted that service medical records were unavailable and that attempts to obtain those records had been unsuccessful from either the Veteran or the National Personnel Records Center. 

Based on the above facts, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date based on the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) and, if needed, a retroactive evaluation of the disability to assess the proper effective date.

In this regard, the Veteran's headache claim is reconsidered and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted is August 24, 1992, the date on which the Veteran first filed his claim of entitlement to service connection for headaches.  See August 24, 1992, VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation.  The RO denied the claim in October 1993.  The RO found that the Veteran had complained of headaches and outpatient records after discharge from service but that there was no evidence of headaches due to disease or trauma during active duty service.  As the condition was not shown by the evidence of record as related to service, service connection was denied.  See October 13, 1993, Rating Decision. 

In December 1993 and September 1996, the Veteran's STRs were associated with the record, and on November 19, 2010, the Veteran filed another claim of service connection for headaches.  The currently assigned effective date of November 19, 2010, is based on that date of claim.

VA has an obligation to obtain service treatment records which are known to be in existence.  See Mayhue v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 273 (2011) (stating that a Veteran is not precluded from seeking an earlier effective date on grounds that he failed to cooperate fully with VA's requests for information, where VA failed to locate records).  The Board observes that VA specifically indicated in the October 1993 denial that STRs were unavailable and denied the Veteran's claim, at least in part, because there was no evidence of the disability during active duty service.  Notably, the rating decision did not advise the Veteran of any repercussions for the lack of STRs, nor does the record provide documentation of proper notice to the Veteran regarding attempts to obtain his STRs.  Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the exception noted in 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2) does not apply.  Accordingly, August 24, 1992, is considered the date of claim per 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(3).

Furthermore, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has held that the effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating entitlement, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was ultimately awarded was filed with VA.  Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 380 (1999).

Thus, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for headaches is August 24, 1992, the date of the receipt of the Veteran's original claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); Mayhue, 24 Vet. App. at 28; Vigil, 22 Vet. App. at 66-67.  Since no claim for compensation benefits for headaches was received within one year of separation from active service or at any other time prior to August 24, 1992, an effective date prior to August 24, 1992, is precluded as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
