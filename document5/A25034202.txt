Eligibility for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits.

REASONS FOR REMAND

This claim is based on the service of a service member who served on active duty from May 1968 to January 1971.  He was discharged from service under conditions other than honorable.  He died in June 2021.  The appellant is his surviving spouse.  

The case is on appeal from an October 2021 decision.  

In a January 2022 notice of disagreement (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on that claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board denied this appeal in a November 2022 decision.  The appellant appealed the Board's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), which issued a memorandum decision in June 2024.  The Court's decision vacated and remanded matter to the Board.

The Board is issuing a separate decision under a different docket number regarding whether the character of the underlying service member's service was under dishonorable conditions and is therefore a bar to VA benefits.  

Eligibility for DIC benefits.

This issue is intertwined with the threshold issue concerning whether the character of the underlying service member's service was under dishonorable conditions and is therefore a bar to VA benefits.  The Board is remanding that issue in a separate decision at this time.  

The Board finds that the instant issue must also be remanded as resolution of the DIC claim is predicated on a favorable finding in the character of discharge issue.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

After undertaking all development and adjudication concerning the issue of whether the character of the underlying service member's service was under dishonorable conditions and is therefore a bar to VA benefits, readjudicate the instant appeal for DIC benefits.
