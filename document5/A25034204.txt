ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's PTSD is etiologically related to his active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for PTSD, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 1991 to October 1996.

By way of history, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD in February 2022.  See February 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  The claim was denied in a May 2022 agency of original (AOJ) decision.  See May 2022 Rating Decision.

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 decision.  In July 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In August 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal denying the Veteran's claim for PTSD.  See August 2023 Rating Decision.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

The Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD.  Upon review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's PTSD is etiologically related to his active-duty service.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for any current disability that is the result of a disease contracted or an injury sustained in the line of duty during active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for a disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection on a "direct" basis generally requires medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Service connection on a secondary basis may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 (1995).

In order to prevail on the issue of secondary service connection, the record must show: (1) a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) a medical nexus between the current disability and the service-connected disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509 (1998); Allen v. Brown, supra.

Factual Background

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any complaints of, or treatment for, psychiatric conditions while on active-duty service.  See STR - Medical.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  See February 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ.

In a statement, the Veteran reported being exposed to risk during his service in Panama, and that they were always on high alert and at risk to life.  The Veteran said this experience caused "stress and trauma."  See February 2022 Statement in Support of Claim for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  The Veteran submitted another statement where he relayed, that he was a on a mission in Panama City, Panama from July 1995 to August 1996 with Marine Forces South to help with counter drug interdiction.  He reported that he was often tasked with going out the city for various movements and pick up of personn[e]l, and many times, they had to reroute because of roadblocks and riots in the streets.  He expressed being exposed to drug interdiction, heightened awareness and threat of life.  Additionally, the Veteran reported that when he returned to the United States, he had a difficult time in many situations with traffic on the roads and crowded rooms.  The Veteran also reported that not knowing he had these issues led to cheating and divorce in his first and the same issues in his second marriage.  The Veteran noted he received counseling for his marital issues and heavy traffic and crowded rooms still cause him to be overwhelmed, "awkward for others around him," and causes "near panic attacks."  See February 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a PTSD Disability Benefits Questionnaire to VA.  See December 2021 Review Post PTSD DBQ.  The doctor diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD according to DSM-5 criteria.  Id.  The doctor marked that no records were reviewed but identified that he had received and reviewed VA medical evaluations, active-duty service records, civilian medical summaries and treatment past, previous and current evaluations, collateral interviews, and observation of the Veteran during clinical interview.  Id.  The doctor opined the Veteran's PTSD was as least a s likely as not connected to his active-duty service while serving the United States Marine Corps.  Id.

In January 2023, and February 2023, the Veteran's stressor was attempted to be verified by the Military Records Research Center.  See January 2023 and February 2023 Records Research Center Response.  Both responses were unable to verify the Veteran's stressor based on an incomplete or missing unit of assignment.  In February 2023, the Research Center verified that the Veteran had served from July 23, 1995, to August 26, 1995, in Panama based on personnel records.  See February 2023 Records Research Center Response.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted several documents in support of his claim.  First, he submitted an article addressing the US military response to the 1994 Cuban Migration Crisis.  In May 1995, the US released a statement that Cubans interdicted at sea would not be taken to a safe haven but would be returned to Cuba where they could apply for entry into the United States.  See Cuba: U.S. Response to the 1994 Cuban Migration Crisis, submitted in February 2023.  Second, the Veteran submitted a history that catalogued the violence in Panama concerning Cuban migrants in the Panama Canal Zone.  The article discussed protests that turned extremely violent in response to the inability for Cuban migrants to be interdicted to the United States and had to first either go to a migrant camp or go back to Cuba to file to come to the US by legal means.  While the worst of the violence was documented to be in February 1995, the unrest in the area began in December 1994, there was protests and rioting documented until the migrants were completely moved from the area in April 1996.  See "A Skillful Show of Strength - U.S. Marines in the Caribbean, 1991-1996", submitted February 2023.  Lastly, the Veteran submitted an article from January 1995 which documented the violence with Cuban migrants in Panama.  See The Washington Post, "Cubans 'Safe Haven' in Panama turns bitter, submitted February 2023.

In March 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claimed PTSD.  See March 2023 Initial Post Traumatic Stress DBQ.  The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD.  Id.  The Veteran endorsed mood and anxiety issues to persist related to his military experiences.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran's PTSD was at least as likely as not incurred in, or caused by, his active-duty service.  See March 2023 Medical Opinion DBQ.  In his rationale, the examiner explained that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD that is at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the trauma/riots during his deployment to Panama City, Panama.  Id. 

Analysis

Current Disability

In February 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claimed psychiatric condition.  See December 2021 Review Post PTSD DBQ.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD.  Id. 

As such, the Board finds that the first element of service connection, a current disability, has been satisfied.

In-service Incurrence

Although the Veteran's STRs are silent to complaints of, or treatment for, PTSD, the Board finds that the evidence of record supports the Veteran's assertion that he experienced protests and rioting while stationed in Panama in 1995 during active-duty service which caused his PTSD.  See February 2022 Statement in Support of Claim for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; See February 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 1154  (Adjudication of a claim for service connection for PTSD requires the evaluation of the evidence in light of the places, types, and circumstances of service, as evidenced by service records, the official history of each organization in which the veteran served, the veteran's military records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence).

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms as well as the onset and progression of that symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board also notes that although individual incidents of protests and riots have not been independently verified, the circumstances of the Veteran's service have been corroborated by multiple sources.

First, the Veteran's military personnel records confirm his service in Panama and document.  Research Records confirm he was there between July 1995 and August 1995.  See Department of Defense Form 214 (DD-214); February 2023 Records Research Center Response.

Second, the Veteran submitted articles about the protests in riots in Panama during the time that the Veteran was stationed there.  The information contained therein is probative insofar as it corroborates the Veteran's account of protests and riots during the time the Veteran was stationed there.

In light of the corroborating evidence above, the Board finds that the Veteran's testimony is credible and highly probative in determining whether he experienced protests and riots which while serving on active-duty in Panama.  See Cuba: U.S. Response to the 1994 Cuban Migration Crisis, submitted in February 2023; "A Skillful Show of Strength - U.S. Marines in the Caribbean, 1991-1996", submitted February 2023; The Washington Post, "Cubans 'Safe Haven' in Panama turns bitter, submitted February 2023.  

The Veteran reported that his experiences with protests and rioting in Panama caused him to have a fear of threat of life and that it still causes him to be overwhelmed, "awkward for others around him," and causes "near panic attacks."  See February 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.  The Board finds the Veteran's statements regarding his psychological symptomatology is competent, credible, and probative in establishing an onset during service.  The Veteran's statements are competent evidence as to the symptoms associated with his psychological issues as they come through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the second element of service connection, an in-service incurrence, has been satisfied.

Nexus

Thus, the final remaining question is whether there is a medical nexus between the Veteran's in-service incurrence and his current diagnosis of PTSD.

Weighing in favor of a medical nexus are the February 2022 Veteran submitted DBQ and March 2023 VA medical opinion.  See December 2021 Review Post PTSD DBQ; March 2023 Initial Post Traumatic Stress DBQ.  The examiner's opined that the Veteran's PTSD was at least as likely as not incurred in, or caused by, his active-duty service.  Id.  In support of this opinion, the examiners noted that the Veteran experienced symptoms of PTSD that were caused by the protests and riots the Veteran experienced while in Panama in July and August 1995.

Generally, the degree of probative value which may be attributed to a medical opinion is determined by such factors as thoroughness, degree of detail, and whether there was review of the claims file.  See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).

Here, while the examiner indicated that he did not review the claims file on the February 2022 DBQ, he further described specific items and that he did indeed review the Veteran's medical history.  Furthermore, the March 2023 DBQ corroborates the February 2022 opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was directly caused by his exposure to protests and riots during his service in Panama.

The Board notes that there are no countervailing medical opinions of record and finds that the February 2022 and March 2023 opinions, taken together, are highly probative in determining whether a medical nexus exists between the Veteran's in-service exposure to protests and rioting in Panama and his current diagnosis of PTSD.

In light of the above, the Board finds that evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's PTSD is the result of his active-duty service.  As such, the benefit of the doubt is given to the Veteran and the Board finds that the third element of service connection, a medical nexus, has been satisfied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107;38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.
