ORDER

Entitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606 of Title 10 of the United States Code (Chapter 1606 or Montgomery GI Bill for Selected Reserves (MGIB-SR)), is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Information received from the Department of Defense (DoD) reveals that the appellant's eligibility to receive Chapter 1606 education assistance benefits terminated on April 1, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606, are not met. 10 U.S.C. §§ 16132, 16133, 16134; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.1034, 21.7540(a), 21.7550.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served in the National Guard. It is noted that because the appellant does not have active service and is not service-connected for any disability, veteran status is not conferred. See Hill v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 243 (2016).

The decision on appeal was issued on March 7, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act, applies.

On the April 24, 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606.

The appellant appeals a March 2023 decision that denied entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606. Aside from general disagreement with the decision, the appellant has not raised any specific argument or contention. 

The Board concludes that the appellant is not eligible for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits. 

Under Chapter 1606, educational assistance benefits are available for members of the Selected Reserve of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, as well as the Army and Air National Guard. 38 C.F.R. § 21.7520. The DoD decides who is eligible for the program, and VA makes the payments for the program. 10 U.S.C. § 16132(c); 38 C.F.R. § 21.7540(a).

Here, the appellant had service in the National Guard and a March 2023 VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR) report reflects that his eligibility for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits was terminated on April 1, 2020, due to unsatisfactory participation. The Board observes that the VADIR database is an electronic repository of a military personnel's service history, payroll information and their dependents' data provided to VA by DoD's Defense Manpower Data Center. VA applications use the VADIR database to retrieve profile data, as well as address, military history, and information on compensation and benefits, disabilities, and dependents. See 74 Fed. Reg. 37093 (July 27, 2009). Thus, information contained on an information report received from the VADIR database is information received from DoD.

Given that service department findings are binding on VA for purposes of establishing an individual's service and DoD decides who is eligible for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits, the Board does not have the authority to alter the findings of the service department. See 10 U.S.C. § 16132; 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 3.203(a), 21.7540(a); see also Spencer v. West, 13 Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000). In other words, the Board is bound by the DoD's finding, which shows that the appellant does not meet the basic eligibility requirements for Chapter 1606 educational assistance benefits. The proper course for the appellant, in this case, if he believes there is a reason to dispute the DoD's determination or the content of military records, is to pursue such a disagreement with the service department. See Sarmiento v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1994) ("An unsuccessful applicant who believed there was reason to dispute the report of the service department or the contents of military records could pursue such disagreement with the service department.").

Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to VA educational assistance benefits, under Chapter 1606, is denied as a matter of law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law is dispositive, the claim must be denied due to a lack of legal merit).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
