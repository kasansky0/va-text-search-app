FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On April 29, 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's service connection claim for diabetes mellitus, Type II (DM II), which has been construed as to include the claim for service connection for PVD of the LLE, and at the time of the filing the Veteran had PVD of the LLE. 

2. On April 29, 2005, VA received the Veteran's service connection claim for DM II, which has been construed as to include the claim for service connection for PVD of the RLE, and at the time of the filing the Veteran had PVD of the RLE. 

3. Prior to July 7, 2006, the Veteran's LLE PVD was not manifested by claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less.

4. From July 7, 2006, the Veteran's LLE PVD is manifested by claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less.

5. Prior to July 7, 2006, the Veteran's RLE PVD was not manifested by claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less.

6. From June 7, 2006, the Veteran's RLE PVD is manifested by claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less.

7. Prior to August 25, 2015, the Veteran did not have a 100 percent service-connected disability with additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from January 1963 to September 1970; he died on [REDACTED], 2017.  In November 2018, the Veteran's spouse (the appellant) was recognized as a substitute claimant.

Procedural History

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a March 2020 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The December 2022 HLR found clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the March 2020 rating decision. Based on these CUE findings, the December 2022 HLR assigned earlier effective dates (EEDs) for PVD of the LLE and RLE.

In November 2023, VA received the appellant's VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), indicating her wish to appeal the December 2022 HLR decision.  The appellant selected the Board's Direct Review docket.  

Applicable Evidentiary Window

As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request.  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.: see also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  

1.	Entitlement to effective dates of April 29, 2005, for the awards of service connection for PVD of the LLE and RLE are granted.

The appellant generally argues that EEDs for the grants of service connection for PVD of the LLE and RLE are warranted. See VA Form 10182, dated November 2023.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of benefits is generally the date on which the claim that resulted in the award was filed. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on an initial claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

The December 2022 HLR rating decision found CUE in a March 2020 rating decision as to the effective dates of the grant to PVD of the LLE and RLE and granted an EED of July 7, 2006, for PVD of the LLE and RLE. That grant was based on the finding that the Veteran submitted an informal claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus on April 29, 2005, which was found to include claims for PVD of the of the LLE and RLE. 

As such, the earliest possible effective date for PVD of the LLE and RLE would be date of the filing of the claim, namely April 29, 2005, if the Veteran had PVD of the LLE and/or RLE at that time. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The HLR rating decision reviewed the record and found that the earliest record of PVD (the date entitlement arose) was a private treatment record with Atlanta West Primary Care dated July 7, 2006, that showed the Veteran complained of leg cramps with walking and the examiner diagnosed PVD and noted claudication. Thus, the HLR rating decision assigned July 7, 2006, as the effective date.

As noted above, under 38 CFR 3.400, the effective date for service connection will be the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. As such, the Board has reviewed the record to see if the Veteran had PVD at any time prior to the assigned effective July 7, 2006. The record does demonstrate that a March 2, 2005, record from Atlanta West reveals that the Veteran was complaining about problems with his legs.  As such, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of April 29, 2005, the date he filed his claim, is the correct effective date for service connection for PVD of the LLE and RLE. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400. Therefore, the Board grants an effective date of April 29, 2005, for the grant of service connection for PVD of the LLE and RLE. 

2.	Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for PVD of the LLE from August 25, 2005, to July 6, 2006, is denied, a rating of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, to July 6, 2007, is granted, and a rating in excess of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, is denied. 

3.	Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for PVD of the RLE from April 29, 2005, to July 6, 2006, and a rating in excess of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, are denied. 

The appellant generally argues for increased ratings for PVD of the LLE and RLE. See VA Form 10182, dated November 2023.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

As found above, the Veteran is service-connected for PVD of the LLE and RLE effective from April 29, 2005. As a result, the period on appeal stems from April 29, 2005, to the Veteran's death in 2017. For service-connected PVD of the LLE, the Veteran is currently assigned an initial noncompensable rating and then a 20 percent rating from June 7, 2007, and for service-connected PVD of the LLE, he is assigned a 20 percent from July 7, 2006; both under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7114.

Under the rating provisions applicable, the Veteran's PVD is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7114, which assigns a 20 percent rating when there is claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less. A 40 percent rating is assigned when there is claudication on walking less between 25 and 100 yards on a level grade at 2 miles per hour, and either trophic changes (thin skin, absence of hair, dystrophic nails), or ankle/brachial index of 0.7 or less. A 60 percent rating is assigned when there is claudication on walking less than 25 yards on a level grade at 2 miles per hour, and either persistent coldness of the extremity or ankle/brachial index of 0.5 of less. A 100 percent rating is assigned when there is ischemic limb pain at rest, and either deep ischemic ulcers or ankle/brachial index of 0.4 of less. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7114 (2017). If more than one extremity is affected, they are to be rated separately. Id. at Note (3).

The regulations for PVD were revised, effective November 14, 2021. However, as noted above, the Veteran died in 2017 and that is when the appeal period ends, and as a result, they will not be applied in this case.

A review of the record reveals that a private treatment record from Atlanta West Primary Care, dated July 7, 2006, shows the Veteran complained of leg cramps with walking and the examiner diagnosed PVD and noted claudication and decreased pulses in the Veteran's RLE. The veteran was treated at VAMC Atlanta and a June 7, 2007, record shows the Veteran had trophic changes in his bilateral lower extremities (onychomycosis) and that the pulses in his feet were normal and a February 20, 2008, note shows he walked 1-1/5 miles, and no issues with that were noted. Further on August 14, 2008, the Veteran was noted to have decreased pulses in his RLE. In July 2017, the Veteran underwent a VA examination that was conducted by telephone as the Veteran was in hospice care. The examiner noted that the Veteran had a history of PVD and had a decreased pulse on the right. 

An initial compensable rating for PVD of the LLE and an initial rating for a compensable rating for PVD of the RLE, both from August 25, 2005, to July 6, 2006, are not warranted. Based on the evidence of record, there is no evidence in that period that would entitle him to a compensable rating, to include that there is no claudication on walking more than 100 yards and diminished peripheral pulses or ankle/brachial index of 0.9 or less that would entitle him to the next higher rating of 20 percent.   

Further, the Board finds that from July 7, 2006, the date of the Atlanta West Primary Care record showing the Veteran complained of leg cramps with walking and the examiner diagnosed PVD and noted claudication, that the Veteran is entitled to a 20 percent rating, but the evidence does not demonstrate that he is entitled to a rating in excess of the 20 percent rating for PVN of the LLE or RLE from July 7, 2006. Here, in order to be entitled to the next higher rating of 40 percent the evidence needs to show there is claudication on walking less between 25 and 100 yards on a level grade at 2 miles per hour, and either trophic changes (thin skin, absence of hair, dystrophic nails), or ankle/brachial index of 0.7 or less. See DC 7114 (2017). Here, the evidence reveals that a VAMC record of June 7, 2007, shows that the Veteran had trophic changes in his LLE and RLE (onychomycosis) and that on August 14, 2008, the Veteran was noted to have decreased pulses in his RLE. However, there is no evidence that there is claudication on walking less between 25 and 100 yards on a level grade at 2 miles per hour. As such, a rating in excess of 20 percent is denied.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that entitlement to an initial compensable rating for PVD of the LLE from August 25, 2005, to July 6, 2006, is denied, that a rating of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, to July 6, 2007, is granted, and that a rating in excess of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, is denied. Further, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for PVD of the RLE from April 29, 2005, to July 6, 2006, is denied and a rating in excess of 20 percent from July 7, 2006, is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

4.	Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 25, 2015, for the grant of SMC based on housebound status is denied.

The Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to August 25, 2015, for SMC based on housebound criteria. See VA Form 10182, dated November 2023.

SMC is a statutory benefit payable in addition to the compensation a veteran receives based on the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38?U.S.C. §?1114. SMC rates vary depending on the specific nature of a veteran's disability picture and eligibility requires a veteran to show specific disabling conditions.   

In order to establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), a veteran must have: (1) a single service-connected disability rated as "total," and (2) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1); 38 C.F.R. §?3.350(i)(1). The first requirement can be satisfied by a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), but only if the TDIU award is predicated on a single disability. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?242, 249-50 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?280, 289-93 (2008). Unless a veteran has a single disability that is sufficient to warrant a TDIU rating (or a 100% schedular rating for a single disability), he or she does not meet the criteria for SMC under section 1114(s).   

In the March 2020 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded entitlement to SMC(s)(1) with an effective date of August 25, 2015, the date he met the criteria. See March 2020 rating decision and Codesheet. Specifically, it was noted that SMC (s)(1) was granted "on account of lung cancer rated 100 percent and additional service-connected disabilities of diabetes mellitus type II, lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, left lower extremity (left leg condition), coronary atherosclerotic heart disease status post coronary artery bypass graft (claimed as heart problems), peripheral vascular disease, right lower extremity (right leg condition), independently ratable at 60 percent or more from 08/25/2015." See March 2020 rating decision Codesheet.

Here, a review of the record demonstrates that the Veteran did not meet the statutory requirements for the award of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) until August 25, 2015. As such, an effective date prior to August 25, 2015, for the grant of SMC based on housebound status is denied.
