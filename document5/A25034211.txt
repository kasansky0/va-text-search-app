REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1982 to September 1984.

This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) on appeal of a March 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim of TDIU most recently addressed in a February 2023 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and addressed the merits, which by doing so impliedly found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of the decision. This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to address the claim on the merits. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to a TDIU and contends that his service-connected disabilities have prevented him from securing and following all forms of substantially gainful employment. See 11/19/22 VA Form 21-8940. 

It is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. A finding of total disability is appropriate when there is any present impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340(a)(1), 4.15.?? 

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.34l, 4.16(a).

Even if service-connected disabilities fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), a total disability rating may also be assigned on an extraschedular basis, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). Section 4.16(b) applies to veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities but fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in section 4.16(a). The Board does not have the authority to assign an extraschedular TDIU rating in the first instance, but it can review the record and determine whether an appropriate case is to be referred to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 8-10 (2001); see Wages v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 233, 236 (2015); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The central inquiry is, "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009).

Critically, the initial extraschedular referral standard under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) addresses only whether there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disabilities. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019), Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1, 2 (U.S. 2021). The "reasonable possibility" standard is "far lower" than the standard applicable to the ultimate determination of whether entitlement to extraschedular TDIU has been shown. See Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 58.

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities are as follows: pes planus with plantar fasciitis rated as 30 percent disabling; right knee instability associated with right knee medial meniscus tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome rated as 30 percent disabling; cervical strain s/p fractured right clavicle rated as 20 percent disabling; right knee medial meniscus tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome rated as 20 percent disabling; right knee dislocated semilunar cartilage rated as 20 percent disabling; radiculopathy right upper extremity associated with cervical strain s/p fractured right clavicle rated as 20 percent disabling; radiculopathy left upper extremity associated with cervical strain s/p fractured right clavicle rated as 20 percent disabling; left knee degenerative arthritis associated with right knee medial meniscus tear, with patellofemoral pain syndrome rated as 10 percent disabling; and hallux valgus of the right foot rated as 10 percent disabling.

Here, the Veteran has a combined rating of 90 percent effective January 30, 2024. Although he does not have a single service-connected disability rated at least 40 percent or a single service-connected disability rated at least 60 percent to meet the schedular threshold, the Board finds there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities.

The Veteran filed his claim for TDIU on November 19, 2022 stating that his feet, knees, back and neck prevented him from obtaining gainful employment. See 11/19/22 VA Form 21-8940. In October 2019, he became too disabled to work due to his service-connected disabilities, and therefore, this was the last job he worked full time. He explained that he left his last job due to chronic pain and inflammation as the latter made simple movement unbearable.

Regarding the Veteran's education, he completed four years of high school. Id. He also reported taking one semester of college classes. See 4/5/22 VA Form 28-1902w.

With respect to employment history, the Veteran had a variety of occupations post-service. Most recently, he was a beverage stocker from January 2018 to October 2019 and a technician/dock lead/forklift operator prior to such from November 2010 to October 2016. See 11/19/22 VA Form 21-8940 at 2; see also 1/31/24 Medical Treatment Records-Furnished by SSA at 25. Prior to such jobs, he also was a security guard, detention officer, a census administrator, driver/truck driver, housekeeper in a hospital, inventory auditor, and construction laborer. Id at 20, 69.

Post-service treatment records from January 2022 to July 2022 show the Veteran reporting pain in his low back, right knee, neck, and feet. See 1/21/22 CAPRI at 159; 6/27/22 CAPRI at 8. He also reported lumbar radicular pain that felt like burning and tingling and that such pain worsened when walking. See 3/14/22 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility at 18; 7/25/22 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility at 2.

In June 2022, the Veteran reported that he was still unemployed. See 6/27/22 CAPRI at 125.

In December 2022, the Veteran submitted lay statements from himself, his wife, and his mother-in-law. He reported that he had chronic daily pain that affected his mobility and dexterity. See 12/14/22 Veteran's Correspondence. He reported having pain in his knee, feet, back, and neck, which made it impossible to work. Most of the time he stayed home because he had difficulty traveling long distances. The Veteran also reported that he is deemed disabled by social security. See 9/5/24 Appellate Brief at 7. His wife and his mother-in-law also stated the same regarding the Veteran's disabilities. See 12/14/22 Spouse's Correspondence; 12/14/22 Mother-In-Law's Correspondence.

Also in December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his neck, knee, and foot disabilities. During his neck examination, he reported that he had throbbing pain in his neck and had difficulty turning his neck from side to side. See 12/24/22 VA Neck Examination at 3.

During his foot examination, the Veteran reported he had chronic throbbing pain in both feet, which caused him difficulty with prolonged walking, running, jumping, squatting, standing, kneeling, and bending. See 12/24/22 VA Foot Examination at 5. He said that the pain would be alleviated if he took pressure off his feet and applied ice.

During his knee examination, he reported pain in his right knee, which caused difficulty with prolonged walking, running, jumping, squatting, standing, kneeling, and bending. See 12/24/22 VA Knee and Lower Leg Examination at 5.

In May 2023, he underwent a VA examination for his right knee. He continued to report constant knee pain that he rated an eight out of ten. See 5/23/23 VA Examination at 3. He also reported instability, tightness, and clicking in his right knee. When he had a flare-up, he felt his knee snapping together as if it was not whole, but rather two pieces fitting together. Activity made his pain worse, and he could not walk on his right knee. His right knee caused difficulty with standing, walking for long periods of time, bending, stooping, twisting, and lifting or carrying anything. He used a knee brace, cane, and walker.

In February 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his neck, foot, right knee, and back. During his neck examination, he reported that he had to quit his job as a beverage stockman due to neck pain and issues with his shoulders. See 2/10/24 VA Neck Examination at 3. He had daily pain in his neck, with more pain in the right side than the left side, which affected his ability to lift. He also had sharp pain when performing random activities such as getting out of the bath, a chair, or vehicle, and while driving. The examiner found the Veteran to be limited in any job-related task that would require lifting as it could cause a flare-up.

During his foot examination, the Veteran reported having feet pain when walking, wearing certain shoes, and standing for prolonged periods of time. See 2/10/24 VA Foot Examination at 3. His pain was moderate, but he had flare-ups daily.

During his knee examination, the Veteran reported that his right knee had dull aching pain and sharp pain during flare-ups. See 2/10/24 VA Knee and Lower Leg Examination at 3. He also reported instability, swelling, and locking/clicking of the right knee. He explained that the pain worsened when walking, bending, lifting, and with any activity that required pressure on the knee as it felt like his foot would get stuck. He also fell in the past when he felt his foot became stuck. The VA examiner found that the right knee affected the Veteran's ability to walk and stand for prolonged periods of time, but that he could do sedentary work and would need frequent breaks to avoid his knee pain/stiffness.

During his back examination, the Veteran reported that he had pain in his back for years to the point where he recently stopped working. See 2/10/2024 VA Back Examination at 2. He had aching pain, swelling, and flare-ups two to three times per week. His pain worsened with bending, sitting, driving, standing, dressing, and with most activities of daily living. He also used a rollator for balance. The VA examiner found that the Veteran's mobility was significantly affected due to his pain, but he could not evaluate the severity of such due to the Veteran's inability to engage in range of motion testing. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities. Therefore, referral to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis, for the period beginning one year prior to the date of claim of November 19, 2022, is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the Veteran's claim for entitlement to TDIU, for the rating period beginning one year prior to the date of claim of November 19, 2022, to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular TDIU consideration per 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). A copy of the Director's decision on this claim must be included in the electronic claims file.
