ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of May 31, 2017, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for generalized seizure disorder is granted.

From March 28, 2022, entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for generalized seizure disorder is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for epilepsy on May 31, 2017, and continued to timely pursue this claim, keeping it pending to the July 2022 rating decision awarding service connection for generalized seizure disorder.

2. From March 28, 2022, the Veteran's generalized seizure disorder did not manifest in an average of at least one major seizure in four months over the last year, or an average of at least nine to ten minor seizures per week.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date for the award of service connection for generalized seizure disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. From March 28, 2022, the criteria for a rating in excess of 40 percent for generalized seizure disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8911.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1979 to August 1981. 

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for epilepsy on May 31, 2017, and a rating decision was issued under the legacy system in December 2017. In March 2018 the Veteran opted into the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) via a RAMP election form, selecting the supplemental claim lane. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) closed the Legacy claim and issued a RAMP supplemental claim decision in June 2018, continuing to deny service connection. In response, the Veteran filed a RAMP selection form indicating that he sought further review, but selected both supplemental claim review and appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) with the evidence submission review option. The RAMP selection form was the proper form to file to request review or appeal of the June 2018 decision; however, VA never responded to the RAMP selection form or indicated whether the supplemental claim or the Board appeal was accepted. This RAMP selection form remains open and pending.

In January 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, once again asserting a claim for service connection for epilepsy. Because there had been a previous denial of this claim, VA sent the Veteran a letter in May 2019 informing him that he needed to submit the proper form to request readjudication of the issue of service connection for epilepsy. This was not technically true because the January 2019 claim was in the Legacy system, and 21-526EZs were regularly accepted as claims to reopen previously denied issues in that system. The Veteran did not resubmit his claim using a different form; however, the AOJ issued a rating decision confirming and continuing the denial of service connection for epilepsy in June 2019. The decision implicitly accepted the January 2019 21-526EZ as a valid claim. This decision appropriately applied Legacy statutes and regulations, finding new and material evidence to reopen the claim, but denying it on the evidence of record at the time of the decision. However, the review options provided to the Veteran were those of the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

The Veteran responded to the AMA review directions and filed a timely higher-level review (HLR) request on December 16, 2019. The AOJ issued a HLR rating decision continuing the denial in March 2020.

In April 2020, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement for the March 2020 rating decision, electing the evidence submission docket.

While the April 2020 Board appeal was pending, the Veteran filed another HLR request in December 2021, indicating that he sought HLR for the March 2020 rating decision denying his claim for service connection for epilepsy. The AOJ rejected the HLR request as untimely because the most recent rating decision denying service connection for epilepsy had been issued in March 2020, over a year prior. 

In March 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0996, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension ("Intent to File"), and in April 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim once again seeking service connection for epilepsy. In July 2022, the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal, granting the Veteran service connection for epilepsy, rated as 40 percent disabling, with an effective date of March 28, 2022 (the date of the Intent to File). In October 2022, the Veteran appealed this rating decision, claiming entitlement both to an earlier effective date for service connection and to a rating in excess of 40 percent. This is the appeal before the Board today.

In November 2023, the Board dismissed the Veteran's April 2020 appeal claiming entitlement to service connection for epilepsy, finding that the issue was moot because the AOJ had awarded service connection for epilepsy in its July 2022 rating decision.

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty-to-assist argument).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for generalized seizure disorder 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of May 31, 2017 for service connection for generalized seizure disorder-the date of his initial service-connection claim. The current effective date is March 28, 2022.

The assignment of effective dates for compensation is governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Additionally, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a HLR by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a Supplemental Claim or a VA Form 10182.

In the case of continuously pursued claims, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options, including a Supplemental claim, request for higher-level review, or appeal to the Board, within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

On review of the procedural history of the Veteran's service-connection claim, as detailed above, the Board finds that because the AOJ never responded to the Veteran's June 2018 RAMP selection form, timely submitted for review of the June 2018 rating decision, the June 2018 rating decision did not become final. Therefore, the May 31, 2017 claim remained pending. Each subsequent decision on the issue of service connection for epilepsy, therefore, relates back to the May 31, 2017 claim.

The April 2020 Board appeal remained pending at the time of the July 2022 rating decision awarding service connection for generalized seizure disorder, and therefore none of the prior decisions denying the Veteran's service-connection claim had become final. The Board therefore finds that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of May 31, 2017, the date of his initial claim.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for generalized seizure disorder from March 28, 2022

The AOJ will assign an initial rating for generalized seizure disorder from May 31, 2017 to March 27, 2022 when it implements the Board's grant of an earlier effective date. If the Veteran disagrees with the rating assigned by the AOJ for that period, he can request review or appeal of that downstream issue at that time.

The review period before the Board today for this issue begins March 28, 2022, because this initial rating has been adjudicated by the AOJ and appealed to the Board. The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a rating in excess of 40 percent for his generalized seizure disorder.

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The Board may consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time-a practice known as "staged ratings,"- whether or not the claim concerns an initial rating. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126-27 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Where the rating criteria for a disability do not explicitly consider the ameliorative effects of medication, the Board may not consider those effects in assigning a disability rating. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012).

The July 2022 rating decision awarded service connection for generalized seizure disorder , finding that it was directly related to the Veteran's military service based on a medical opinion that the Veteran's seizures began during service, and rated it as 40 percent disabling based on the Veteran having at least one major seizure in the previous six months, with additional symptoms including a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with a history of seizures, and at least two minor seizures in the previous six months. 

Pursuant to DC 8911 General Rating Formula for Major and Minor Epileptic Seizures (General Rating Formula), a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with a history of seizures or the requirement of continuous medication to control symptoms warrants a 10 percent disability rating. A 20 percent disability rating is warranted when at least one major seizure occurred in the last two years; or at least two minor seizures occurred in the last six months. Where at least one major seizure occurred in the last six months or occurred two times in the last year; or there was an average of at least five to eight minor seizures weekly a 40 percent disability rating is warranted. A 60 percent disability rating is warranted where there is an average of at least one major seizure in four months over the last year; or nine to ten minor seizures occurred per week. An 80 percent disability rating is assigned where there is at least one major seizure in three months over the last year; or more than ten minor seizures weekly. A 100 percent disability rating is warranted where there is an average of at least one major seizure per month over the last year. Note (1) states that a major seizure is characterized by the generalized tonic-clonic convulsion with unconsciousness. Note (2) states that a minor seizure consists of a brief interruption in consciousness or conscious control associated with staring or rhythmic blinking of the eyes or nodding of the head ("pure" petit mal), or sudden jerking movements of the arms, trunk, or head (myoclonic type) or sudden loss of postural control (akinetic type). Id.

The Veteran has been prescribed medication for his seizures. The Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication when considering a claim for an increased rating unless the effects of medication are explicitly contemplated by the relevant rating criteria. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). However, the General Rating Formula does contemplate the effects of medication. Note (1) to the General Rating Formula, 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8910 and 8911, explicitly authorizes a 10 percent disability rating when the claimant requires continuous medication to control his or her seizures. Therefore, the Board is not required to discount any ameliorative effect that medication may have on the Veteran's seizures.

The Board's review is limited to the evidence pertaining to the severity of the Veteran's symptoms from March 28, 2022 until the date of the July 2022 rating decision on appeal. 

The record on review contains a Seizure Disorders (Epilepsy) Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQ) from a VA examination conducted in May 2022. It noted that the Veteran reported that he had recently been taken off of seizure medications because he was not able to drive at work while taking the medication. The Veteran reported that the date of his most recent seizure activity was on March 22, 2022. The VA examiner found that the Veteran had had 2 or more minor seizures over the past 6 months at an average frequency of 0-4 per week, and at least 2 major seizures in the past year, with an average frequency of at least 1 major seizure in the past 6 months. The VA examiner further noted that the Veteran's seizures impact his ability to work, as he had "1-2 weeks work time lost in last 12 months" and "[d]ue to the veteran's diagnosis of generalized seizure, he is not able to drive during or after seizures. He is very tired after having seizures and is not able to perform his job efficiently."

The evidence of record, therefore, reflects that the Veteran does not experience an average of at least one major seizure in four months over the last year, or an average of at least nine to ten minor seizures per week, as required for a rating of 60 percent or higher under the General Rating Schedule, DC 8911.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether a 40 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's generalized seizure disorder from March 28, 2022. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application when the evidence is persuasively for or against the claim). The claim is denied.
