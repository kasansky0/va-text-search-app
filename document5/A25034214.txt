REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army National Guard from February 1981 to November 1981.

The claims on appeal were denied in a February 2024 rating decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, as to the claims being remanded herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for arthritis

2. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative disc disease

3. Entitlement to service connection for headaches/chronic migraines

4. Entitlement to service connection for chronic joint pain

The Veteran contends that the above-claimed conditions are the result of exposure to fumes from jet fuel during active service.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of any of the claimed conditions due to disease or injury and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

Notably, the Veteran has not reported and neither does the evidence of record reflect that he sought private or VA treatment for any of the claimed conditions. Likewise, there is no evidence of the conditions in the Veteran's service treatment records.

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran's participation in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) has been conceded due to his exposure to fuel, diesel, industrial solvents, paint fumes, benzene, mono ammonium phosphate, and carbon monoxide, based on his MOS of Aircraft Structural Repair. Under the PACT Act, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical nexus opinion when a veteran submits a compensation claim and has evidence of a disability and participation in a TERA, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a) (see PACT Act, Sec. 303). The only exception to this requirement occurs when the Secretary determines there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and the TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b). 

In this case, the Board points out that there is no evidence of the claimed disabilities in the record. Additionally, as the Veteran's joint pain and arthritis claims, there is no indication of an association between the claimed disabilities and the TERA. Accordingly, no VA examinations are warranted as to the claims.

Absent a showing of a diagnosis due to disease or injury, service connection for the above claims cannot be granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for bronchitis is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for lungs and chest burns is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension (claimed as high blood pressure) is remanded.

The Veteran contends that the above-claimed conditions are the result of exposure to fumes from jet fuel during active service.

Due to the Veteran's conceded participation in TERA and an indication of an association between the claimed disability and the TERA, the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations for the above-claimed conditions. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a) (see PACT Act, Sec. 303).

The Board notes that the Veteran was scheduled for VA examinations in October 2023. However, it appears he was unable to report due to his incarceration, or that the examinations were cancelled due to the same. See October 2023 Exam Requests. Notably, the record indicates that the Veteran does not expect to be released until 2027. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, received November 3, 2022. The duty to assist incarcerated veterans requires VA to tailor its assistance to meet the peculiar circumstances of confinement, and thus, incarcerated veterans are entitled to the same care and consideration afforded their fellow non-incarcerated veterans. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). As the Veteran presented good cause, the Board finds that the failure to obtain VA examinations and opinions is a pre-decisional duty to assist error and remand is warranted to reschedule the VA examinations in accordance with the procedures for incarcerated veterans.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for VA examinations to determine the nature and etiology of any currently present bronchitis, lung and chest burns, and hypertension. The VA examinations must be scheduled in accordance with the procedures for incarcerated veterans. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated studies should be performed.

a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that any diagnosed bronchitis had its onset in service or is related to an event, injury or disease incurred in service, to include any documented participation in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

b.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that any diagnosed condition manifested by lung and chest burns had its onset in service or is related to an event, injury or disease incurred in service, to include any documented participation in TERA.

c.) Whether it is at least as likely as not that any diagnosed bronchitis had its onset in service or is related to an event, injury or disease incurred in service, to include any documented participation in TERA.

When providing these opinions, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments AND the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran.

The examiner is reminded that a medical opinion that relies on the absence of general medical literature supporting a nexus without discussing the specific facts of the Veteran's case is inadequate.
