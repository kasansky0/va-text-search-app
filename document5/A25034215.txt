ORDER

Service connection for a heart condition is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's heart condition is not related to his active-duty military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a heart condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served in the U.S. Army from July 1978 to July 1983.  

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Heart Condition

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, cause by, or aggravated by service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish service connection or service-connected aggravation for a present disability, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1166, 1167 (2004).

In the July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision, the AOJ found the Veteran has a present diagnosis for the claimed disability, participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) due to his service as a combat engineer, including JP8 fuels, fumes, exhaust, industrial lubricants, solvents, and snit-corrosion compounds, and had complains of left chest pain in service.  These are favorable findings which satisfy the first two elements of service connection.  The remaining question is whether the exposure or complains of pain during service and his present diagnosis are related.  

In September 2023, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The examiner conducted a review of the Veteran's relevant records and noted he complained of sharp pain in his chest not associated with activity during service.  A physical examination at the time was negative to any abnormalities other than elevated blood pressure and the chest wall pain.  He was later seen by a pulmonary specialist after an enlistment examination noted he had a concave chest and reported his left lung was not able to fully expand.  Pulmonary function testing revealed a mild impairment.  

September 2011 records show the Veteran was treated coronary artery disease through a "coronary artery bypass graft x2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending to circumflex EF 40%." 

After completing the records review and examining the Veteran, the examiner found his disability is less likely than not due to service.  In the "Rationale" section, they wrote the following:  

Records reviewed indicate the following risk factors outside of military service: Smoking history 44 year pack and in note discharge summary by Edmond White ANP [on September 23, 2011.  The] patient had been off Hypertension medications for about 4 months because of insurance issues and had just recently resumed them [on September 1, 2011]. It was also noted in Admission paperwork of a Prediabetes diagnosis [in April 2019].  Patient does take Metformin.  There is also a noted BMI of 30-33% obesity [in] 2019 in the medical record ....  

[A]fter considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran, rationale is the veteran had some risk factors for CAD including being treated for Prediabetes, hypertension and was smoking at that time (he finally quit in 2022). According to the CDC, being overweight, physical inactivity, and smoking are all risk factors for CAD.  There's no evidence any of the potential toxic exposures listed in the TERA that may have been present while performing duties as a Combat Engineer [which] cause coronary artery disease.

Here, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's disability is related to his military service.  The VA examiner's opinion, which the Board finds persuasive, explains the Veteran has several nonservice-connected comorbidities for coronary artery disease, and no evidence exists which shows any in-service exposures causes the disease.  

Because the evidence does not show the Veteran's heart condition is related to his service, the third element of service connection is not met, and the claim must be denied.
