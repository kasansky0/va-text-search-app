ORDER

Eligibility to attorney fees, based on the past-due benefits awarded in a July 2024 rating decision, is denied.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The July 2024 rating decision is the initial decision on the merits with respect to the issue granted, and initially sought in the Veteran's March 2024 claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to attorney fees, based on past-due benefits awarded from the July 2024 rating decision, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1977 to March 1980.

The appellant is the Veteran's attorney representative.

The case is on appeal from a July 2024 decision.

The appellant timely filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) to the July 2024 fee decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  In November 2024, the Veteran was provided a copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures, and has not filed a response.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.403-4.

Therefore, the claim remains on the Direct Review docket, and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  In this case, no additional evidence, only argument, has been received since the July 2024 decision.

Attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in a July 2024 rating decision.

Legal Criteria

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA.  The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney, and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits.  A copy of a direct-pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g).

Fee agreements must be reasonable; those which do not exceed 20 percent of past-due benefits are presumed reasonable.  See 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f).  When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.  A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3).  The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran.  See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

A fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which a claimant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024); Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023).

Analysis

In March 2024, the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22a appointing the appellant as his representative.  The parties also executed a fee agreement at that time, which provided that the appellant was entitled to 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran.  

At the time of appointment, the appellant filed on behalf of the Veteran a claim on VA Form 21-526EZ, for an increased rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected depressive disorder.  In a July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was granted an increased rating to 70 percent for depressive disorder, effective March 19, 2024, the date VA received the Veteran's claim.

In the July 2024 fee decision letter, the parties were advised that although there was a valid direct-pay fee agreement for the appellant, the award did not warrant direct payment of fees because VA never received a qualifying request to review a decision on the issue granted.

The appellant timely filed a NOD in August 2024 to that fee decision, and in November 2024, the Veteran was provided a copy of the appellant's NOD pursuant to contested claims procedures.

The Board finds that the appellant is not eligible to attorney fees from the past-due benefits awarded, as the July 2024 rating decision was the initial AOJ decision with respect to the case for the issue granted.

The fee provisions for decisions issued on or after the effective date for the AMA are applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1) provides that a fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys, provided before the date on which a claimant is given notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  In Held, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) described that the term "initial decision" under section 5904(c)(1) refers to the decision that "triggers" an attorney's ability to charge fees for representation of a claimant.  37 Vet. App. at 28.   

However, in the case of Jackson, the Court further clarified what is considered the "initial decision" for increased rating claims pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  37 Vet. App. at 277.  Particularly, the Court found a new request for an increased rating is a new claim that results in a subsequent initial decision on that claim, even if filed on a supplemental claim form under the AMA system.  This is distinguished from the filing of a supplemental claim in continuous pursuit of a prior, non-final rating decision evaluation.  Id. at 295.

Here, the contested past-due benefits are from the grant of an increased rating of 70 percent for depressive disorder, and the July 2024 rating decision is the initial decision on the new claim for an increased rating for that condition.  An increased rating for depressive disorder was not continuously pursued, as the prior rating decision on that issue in March 2022 had become final by the time of the March 2024 claim.

The appellant asserts that the holding in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021) allows for the charging of fees in this case.  However, the Board does not find this argument persuasive, as Military-Veterans Advocacy is limited to claims for service connection, in which supplemental claims are filed more than one year after the prior denial decision for service connection, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(b).  Id. at 1135-41.  Further, the holding in Jackson clarifies the distinction for increased rating claims that are not continuously pursued, but rather are new claims for a higher rating that relies on different evidence of worsening of symptoms, than the evidence previously relied upon for prior evaluations, as is the case here.  37 Vet. App. at 294-5.

In conclusion, the July 2024 rating decision is the initial decision with respect to the case on the claim for an increased rating for depressive disorder filed in March 2024, and there are no earlier AOJ decisions on the issue granted that could trigger the appellant's ability to charge fees for worked performed prior to July 2024.  Thus, the appellant is not eligible to direct payment of fees by VA from the past-due benefits awarded.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 5904.  Accordingly, the appeal for attorney fees is denied.
