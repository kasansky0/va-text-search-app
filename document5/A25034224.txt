DOCKET NO. 210114-132850
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, PTSD had its onset in service and is at least as likely as not related to an in-service event.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 2010 to November 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).   The Veteran presented sworn testimony at a hearing before the undersigned in September 2024.  

In the January 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on September 19, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

Service Connection 

Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f); Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (holding that a DSM-5 diagnosis is required for service connection to be awarded for a psychiatric disability under § 4.130).

Service connection for PTSD requires a medical diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for PTSD. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that as a Watch Commander he was on duty when a bomb threat was reported, and a bag was left outside the quarter deck on the pier. See October 2019, Statement in Support of Claim of PTSD.

The Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD, meeting the first element in establishing service connection. See Favorable Finding in October 2019 Rating Decision. Thus, the question becomes whether credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred exists and whether there is a link between the stressor and service. The Board finds each element has been met and service connection for SD is warranted. 

The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a recognizable stressor during service varies depending on the circumstances of the Veteran's service and of the claimed stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f). Here, written statements from the Veteran, his spouse, and fellow servicemembers, reports from his mental health examinations and treatment visits, and his testimony at a Board hearing provide credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors occurred. 

The Veteran reports that his traumatic experiences in service included operating as a Watch Commander of a security force on the USS Enterprise when a call came in about a bomb threat on the pier. The Veteran dispatched teams to set boundaries, details, and alert appropriate authorities. Upon arriving to the quarterdeck to report and check-in, the Veteran froze and couldn't recall what he had done in response. The Veteran reported thinking he was going to die and feared for his physical safety during and after the event including the constant questioning of his ability to adequately respond to danger or threats. 

The Veteran also recalled multiple events, one being he had to respond and lock down due to an active shooter at a neighboring pier, which resulted in murder-suicide. See Hearing Transcript. He also recounted multiple arrests of his own men to include one threating at a party to kill the watch commanders. Id.

Buddy statements were provided by the Veteran in support of his claim. A fellow servicemember, J.G., wrote discussing the bomb threat that occurred in early 2014 on the pier which shared the barge in Newport News Shipbuilding Shipyards. See September 20, 2014, Buddy Statement. A separate statement from W.Z., also a fellow servicemember, was received that detailed a bomb threat that was received on the Pier while standing watch at Norfolk Naval Station. See September 18, 2019, Buddy Statement. The Board finds the buddy statements as credible supporting evidence of the claimed in-service stressor. 

Additionally, the Veteran's service records confirm the Veteran was assigned to the USS Enterprise on May 9, 2011. See History of Assignments. See also Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record. The Veteran also had noted deployments from March 2012 to September 2012 and May 2011 to June 2011 with Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger pay from April 2012 to October 2012.See November 25, 2014, Information Report. 

Finally, the Veteran submitted a private opinion from a licensed clinical psychologist In June 2019. The psychologist noted the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in accordance with DSM-5 which was clearly justified based on the veteran's history of experiencing traumatic events during his military service. See Confidential Treatment Summary.  The Board finds the examiner's opinion highly probative as it contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008). "The probative value of evidence is its tendency to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove. Evidence has probative value if it tends to prove the issue in dispute." McCray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 243, 254 (2019) (quoting Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); United States v. Welsh, 774 F.2d 670, 672 (4th Cir. 1985)).

Prior to June 2019, the Veteran underwent a General Medical VA examination. The examiner noted no diagnosis of a psychiatric condition to include PTSD. Noted within the questionnaire completed was that the examination was screening for all body systems and was not meant to elicit the detailed information about specific conditions that is necessary for rating purposes. As a result, the Board finds that examination was insufficient to develop the evidence necessary to adjudicate the claim, and thus the Board assigns it no probative weight. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's reported stressors are adequate to support the diagnosis of PTSD. The circumstances as described are reasonably consistent with the Veteran's service on the USS Enterprise. The Veteran also reported at the hearing before the Board that his psychiatric symptoms started in service and have been present since that time. The Board accepts the Veteran's testimony, and notes corroborating credible service records and buddy statements, as establishing the occurrence of the stressor. 

The Board acknowledges that the December 2014 VA negative opinion, but as noted above, it carries no probative weight with the Board. As a result, entitlement to service connection for PTSD is warranted.

This appeal is granted.
