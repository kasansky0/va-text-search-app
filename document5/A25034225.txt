ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for low back disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's low back disability had its onset during his period of active service from September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008; or that it is otherwise etiologically related to in-service injury or disease incurred or aggravated during his period of active service from September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's low back disability resulted from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing active duty for training (ADT); or is a result of an injury incurred or aggravated in during any period of ADT or inactive duty training (IDT).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army Reserve. The Veteran is service-connected for tinnitus and pseudofolliculitis barbae, which confers veteran status only for the September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008, period of training during which the service-connected disabilities were incurred. See Rating Decision (January 2023) & Deferred Rating (December 2022); see also Hill v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 243 (2016).

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a low back disability most recently addressed in a December 2022 supplemental claim rating decision. On September 7, 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the October 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 7, 2023, AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ issue the supplemental claim decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Reserve and National Guard service generally means ADT and IDT. ADT is full time duty for training purposes performed by Reservists and National Guardsmen pursuant to 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505. 38 U.S.C. § 101(22);            38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c). That usually includes two weeks of annual training and/or an initial period of training. IDT includes duty, other than full-time duty, performed for training purposes by Reservists and National Guardsmen pursuant to 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505. 38 U.S.C. § 101(23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(d).

With respect to Reserve and National Guard service, service connection may only be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing ADT, or an injury incurred or aggravated while performing IDT. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(24), 106, 1110, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.303, 3.304. Certain evidentiary presumptions do not extend to those who claim service connection based on a period of ADT or IDT. Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470-71 (1995); Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010).

Generally, no presumptions (including the presumptions of soundness, aggravation, or for presumptive diseases) attach to periods of ADT unless "veteran" status is attained during those periods. Paulson, 7 Vet. App. at 470. As to the presumption of soundness, it does not apply to a claimant who had only ADT service and who is not otherwise a veteran. Id. Even for veterans who have achieved "veteran" status through a prior period of active service and now claim a disability incurred only during a later period of ADT, the presumption of soundness applies only when the veteran has been "examined, accepted, and enrolled for service" and where that examination revealed no "defects, infirmities, or disorders." Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 45-46 (2010). In other words, there must be an entrance examination prior to the period of ADT in which the claimant claims the disease or injury occurred; otherwise, the presumption of soundness does not attach. Id. at 45-46. 

Entitlement to service connection for low back disability.

The Veteran contends generally that his current low back disability is related to the strain of military training with heavy equipment, physical training, and falling during airborne training course. See VA 21-526EZ (February 2022). He also contends that he sustained low back injury from weightlifting during ADT in April 2010 and an unspecified injury during ADT in April 2011. See VA 21-4138 (August 2022) (April 2023).

The September 2023 rating decision found that the Veteran had a current low back disability. This is a favorable finding by the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Board concludes that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.6, 3.102, 3.303.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran's period of active duty to training from September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008, qualifies as active service because the Veteran established entitlement to service connection for tinnitus and pseudofolliculitis barbae, based on that period of ADT during which those disabilities were incurred. Service records show that he attended parachutists training from June 2008 to July 2008. DPRIS Response at 12, 65 (February 2022). 

Service records also show that the Veteran was on ADT orders in April 2010. See Service Record (September 2023). Finally, Military Personnel Records (MPRs) reflect that the Veteran was on ADT orders from late March 2011 to mid-April 2011 (for annual training) and from late April 2011 to mid-May 2011 (for professional development school). See MPR (April 2023), DPRIS Response at 30 (February 2022). The record does not contain an entrance examination for any of the periods Veteran's period of ADT or IDT-to include those periods he asserts he had had specific injury. The AOJ has determined that no further records exist for the Veteran after a thorough review. See DD2963 Service Treatment Record (STR) Transfer or Certification (February 2022). Therefore, the presumptions of soundness and aggravation do not attach. Smith, 24 Vet. App. at 45-46 (2010). 

A June 2009 periodic health assessment (PHA) reflects that the Veteran denied a history of having or having had back pain. See STR (February 2022). 

The first indication of back problems comes in March 2011. A March 2011 medical evaluation for employment purposes reflects normal clinical evaluation of the spine. A that time, that the Veteran "denied any difficulty" with any of the required activities listed for a "GC Laborer position," and reported that he exercised regularly. STR (February 2022). The Veteran was deemed medically qualified for a GC laborer position with no medical limitations. 

An April 2011 PHA  reflects that the Veteran reported intermittent back pain that was self-treated. STR at 23 (February 2022). 

PHAs, dated September 2012 and September 2013, reflect that the Veteran denied a history of having or having had back pain. See STR at 75, 83 (February 2022). 

A September 2014 PHA reflects a history back pain that was "currently treated" but "not a problem now" and that it occurred with heavy exertion explaining that it was "from running after a long time at a high pace." See id. at 66. There was no mention of injury incurred during ADT or IDT.

A September 2015 PHA reflects that the Veteran denied a history of having or having had back pain. Id. at 53. 

In 2022, VA received the Veteran claim for service connection for low back disability. See VA 21-526EZ (February 2022). VA-obtained Back Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) dated June 2022 and August 2023 reflect a diagnosis for lumbosacral strain. The June 2022 Back DBQ reflects, by history, onset of symptoms in 2010 during military service, described as low back pain with physical training that progressively became more severe and frequent over time. The August 2023 Back DBQ reflects, by history, onset of symptoms in 2011 during annual training from performing deadlifts as part of his physical training (PT). The Veteran reported that he had told his first line leader and that he sat out for the duration of the exercise; he could not recall if he went to the clinic; and noted that he had low back tension during the 2 miles with his boots on and during sit ups for his PT test. 

Based on review of the claims file and examination of the Veteran, the examiner concluded that his low back condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by his service after considering his reports of onset and injury, such as due to earning his parachute badge in Airborne school in July 2008, performing deadlifts for PT in 2011 or other injury. The clinician acknowledged the reported injuries, but reasoned that in the context of the available evidence showing only intermittent back symptoms, and no chronic symptoms since the injuries alleged, lumbosacral strain shown on the 2022 and 2023 VA exams was less likely than not related to the remote alleged injuries reported by the Veteran.

Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the weight of the more persuasive evidence is against the claim for service connection for low back disability. 

First, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability. Both June 2022 and August 2023 Back DBQs reflect a diagnosis for lumbosacral strain. Therefore, the first element of service connection is met. 

Second, however, the Board finds that the evidence persuasive weighs against finding that the Veteran incurred an injury to his back during a period active service, or during any period ADT, or IDT. In this regard, the Veteran's service records reflect no instance of injury, by history or otherwise. Further, there is no Line of Duty (LOD) determination showing that he incurred an injury to his back during a period of active service, ADT, or IDT.

The Board acknowledges the documented complaints in the STRs. For instance, PHAs show that the Veteran reported back pain in April 2011 and again September 2014. These records further show, however, no documented complaints prior to 2011; that the Veteran's denied back problems on PHAs dated in 2012 and 2013; and that when reporting back problems in 2011 and 2014, he did not identify any associated injury incurred during any period of active duty, ADT, or IDT. 

Indeed, the first indication of any injury incurred during a period of active service, ADT, or IDT is on the Veteran's February 2022 VA claim for disability compensation. See VA Form 21-526EZ (February 2022). At that time, the Veteran argued that his low back problems were due to is related to the strain of military training with heavy equipment, physical training, and falling during airborne training course; but he did not provide any specific information as to when symptoms began or identify any specific instance of injury. Later, in August 2022, he reported during his VA examination that he injured his low back from weightlifting during ADT in April 2010 and an unspecified injury during ADT in April 2011. The Veteran is competent to reports injury and symptoms. However, the Board finds the Veteran's reports of injury are unpersuasive because he has been an inconsistent historian as to when and how injury occurred, as noted above; it seems incredible that there would be a parachute fall type injury without an LOD determination or that injury during active service, ADT, or IDT would not have been mentioned by him or otherwise noted when reporting relevant health history on his PHAs in 2011 and 2014; the above, coupled with the September 2015 PHA showing that the Veteran denied back pain, tends to weigh against finding that the Veteran sustained back injury during a period of active service, ADT, or IDT; or that a low back disability was initially manifested during a period of active service, ADT, or IDT. 

The Board has considered the lay statement provided to the Veteran from another service member who states he served with the Veteran and recalled that the Veteran had in April 2010 injured his back during PT. He states that he recalls this because the Veteran had mentioned it to him and he had told the Veteran to go to a medical facility. The buddy further reports that the Veteran could not schedule a medical visit at that time because "his phone had been stolen." See VA Form 21-10210 (August 2022). The buddy further recalled that the Veteran had back pain after sit-ups and a 2 mile run and, although the Veteran continued through the year 2015 leading PT, he noticed the Veteran ran the 2 mile run slower than in earlier, which the Veteran had told him was because of pain in the back, feet, and shins. 

The Board notes that an absence of corroborating evidence and personal interest may factor into the Board's credibility analysis, so long as it is not the sole base for finding the statements not credible. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the Board may "weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence of record," but "cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence"); Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) (explaining that, although the Board "cannot ignore appellant's testimony simply because appellant is an interested party," it may take pecuniary interest into account when assessing the appellant's credibility).

Here, the Board accepts that the Veteran's buddy is competent to report his experiences and recollections pertaining to the Veteran. However, the Board finds that his statement, like that of the Veteran's regarding incurrence of injury, has diminished probative value. This is because his statement suggests that the Veteran's back symptoms following a lifting injury were so severe that the Veteran was going to obtain medical care but did not because of a lost phone that was eventually recovered-yet he did not then obtain medical care for symptoms or injury. It seems incredulous that a lost phone would preclude an individual in that circumstance from obtaining medical care when there were likely other individuals with phones as well as superiors to facilitate such a request. This coupled with the absence of a LOD determination and the absence of any report of injury by the Veteran when reporting back pain in 2011 and his subsequent denial of back condition/symptoms on his 2012, 2013, and 2015 PHAs.

Therefore, in view of the above, the Board finds that the lay statements have diminished probative value as to incurrence of injury in April 2010. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996)

Third, even were the Board to accept that the Veteran had an injury during his period of active service, ADT, or IDT, the service records strongly suggest it was no more than acute and transitory, given (1) the PHAs where he denied back problems; (2) that he was not diagnosed with lumbosacral strain until his June 2022 VA examination, more than a decade after the last service injury alleged by the Veteran; and (3) the medical opinion that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's current back disability (lumbosacral strain) is related to the reported injury/injuries in service (e.g., parachutists training; weightlifting injury in 2010; an injury while on ADT in 2011). 

The Board finds that August 2023 medical opinion is more persuasive than the Veteran's opinion. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of intermittent back pain, he is not competent to determine whether any events during his active service, ADT or IDT caused or otherwise contributed to his lumbosacral strain, diagnosed in 2022. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). By contrast, the August 2023 medical opinion was prepared by a medical professional after examination of the Veteran, consideration of his reported injuries, and review of the claim file to include his STRs. The opinion explained that the nature of his symptoms, being intermittent in nature, did not support finding that his current diagnosis for lumbosacral strain is at least as likely as not related to the reported service incurred injuries from 2011 and earlier. There is a clear conclusion and the essential rational for that conclusion is discernible from the opinion and examination report as a whole. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012).  The opinion reflects consideration of relevant history and the Veteran's theory of causation; thus, it is clear that the examiner was "informed of sufficient facts upon which to base an opinion relevant to the problem at hand." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22Vet. App.295, 301 (2008).

On balance, the more persuasive evidence weighs against the claim for service connection for a low back disability. Specifically, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's low back disability had its onset during his period of active service from September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008; or that it is otherwise etiologically related to in-service injury or disease incurred or aggravated during his period of active service from September 5, 2007, to April 9, 2008. Further, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's low back disability resulted from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while performing ADT; or is a result of an injury incurred or aggravated in during any period of ADT or IDT.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
