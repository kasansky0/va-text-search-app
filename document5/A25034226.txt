DOCKET NO. 241202-501294
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 1, 2024, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder with anxious distress (hereinafter PTSD); entitlement to ratings in excess of 50 percent for PTSD and in excess of 0 percent for hypertension; and entitlement to service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI), high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea (OAS), left and right eye iritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and erectile dysfunction (ED) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 20, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1989 to October 1993.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from multiple rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket and requested review of the TBI, hypertension, high cholesterol, OSA, left and right eye iritis, IBS, PTSD and ED matters listed above. Regarding the PTSD matter, the Veteran did not clarify whether he was appealing its initial rating or the effective date of the award. To afford the Veteran the broadest level of review, the Board liberally construes the December 2024 VA Form 10182 as a disagreement with both issues. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Dismissal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

?

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal in a written and signed statement specifying the above docket number and stating that he wished to "respectfully withdraw and cancel [his] pending appeal at the Board." This statement also included the Veteran's claim number. Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
