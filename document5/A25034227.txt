REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Appellant served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from February 1994 to July 1997; the Appellant is not eligible to receive VA benefits based on this period of service.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in March 2024 and May 2024.  In a timely VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) received in July 2024, the Appellant elected the Direct Review option for this appeal.  Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence in the record at the time of the initial March 2024 and May 2024 AOJ decisions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only for major depressive disorder

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Here, in his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Appellant appealed a March 2024 rating decision denying service connection for treatment purposes only for major depressive disorder.  However, in a May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Appellant also appealed the same issue from the same rating decision.  The Board adjudicated and denied that claim in an April 2025 decision.  In that decision, the Board also found that the Appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of all VA benefits. 

Therefore, there is no longer any error of fact or law pending regarding the issue of entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes for major depressive disorder, and the issue is dismissed.

2. The issue of service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In March 2024, the AOJ denied service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.  In May 2024, the Appellant filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the denial of service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.  As noted above, the Board issued a decision in April 2025 find the Appellant's discharge from service to be a bar to the receipt of VA benefits and denying service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.

In May 2024, the Appellant also filed a supplemental claim for service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.  No additional evidence was added to the claims file.  In a May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.  In this decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Appellant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and antisocial personality disorder features during service.  

In his July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Appellant cited the May 2024 rating decision and asserted entitlement to service connection for alcohol dependence and antisocial personality disorder.

As the Board has already adjudicated the Appellant's claim for service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder, and no additional evidence was added to the record that the Board could not consider in the April 2025 decision, the Board finds there is no remaining error of law or fact regarding the Appellant's entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only for generalized anxiety disorder.  

To the extent the Appellant contested the AOJ's decision not to grant service connection for alcohol dependence and antisocial personality disorder, the Board notes again that it has found the Appellant's discharge to constitute a bar to the receipt of all VA benefits, including healthcare for service-connected disabilities, as he received a bad conduct discharge.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.360(b).  In this regard, the Board finds there is no longer any error of law or fact pertaining to the Appellant's entitlement to service connection for treatment purposes only for alcohol dependence and antisocial personality disorder. 

For these reasons, there is no error of law or fact for the Board to decide, and the appeal is dismissed.
