REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from September 2016 to September 2020.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act, applies.

In his February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 regional office (RO) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding all issues on appeal, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those issues.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for allergies is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral astigmatism is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a traumatic brain injury (claimed as TBI head injury) is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded.

6. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

7. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

8. Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is remanded.

In his October 2022 claim for service connection, the Veteran indicated that he attended two primary care visits at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Texas, in November 2020 and October 2022.  The Veteran did not specify which of the claimed disabilities was treated.  There is no indication in the record that appropriate efforts were made to obtain those VA treatment records prior to issuance of the February 2023 rating decision on appeal.  Therefore, the issues must be remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the decision on appeal by making appropriate efforts to obtain the identified VA treatment records.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c)(2) and 20.802(a); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Make appropriate efforts to obtain the Veteran's VA treatment records, to include records for the two primary care visits at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Texas, in November 2020 and October 2022 that the Veteran identified in his October 2022 claim for service connection.  Make as many requests as are necessary to obtain the records.  If it is determined that the records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain the records would be futile, then notify the Veteran of such in a manner consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).
