FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's diagnosed back disability did not originate in service and is not otherwise etiologically related to service, and did not have onset within one year of separation from service.

2. The Veteran's currently diagnosed cervical spine disability did not originate in service and is not otherwise etiologically related to service, and did not have onset within one year of separation from service.

3. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's GERD is not shown to have been manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

4. The Veteran's audiometric findings show a level of hearing loss consistent with a noncompensable rating.

5. During the appeal period, the Veteran experienced prostrating headaches with less frequent attacks.  The headaches did not manifest in characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.

6. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis has not resulted in nasal polyps or greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

7. No claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches was received prior to May 4, 2022.

8. No claim for entitlement to service connection for GERD was received prior to August 24, 2021.

9. A claim of entitlement to an increased rating for service-connected allergic rhinitis was not received prior to August 24, 2021; it is not factually ascertainable that the disorder underwent an increase in severity at any point in the year prior to the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1980 to June 1995.

This decision has been written consistent with the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  These appeals arise from various rating decisions for which the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review.  In July 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) completed its Higher-Level Review based on the evidence of record at the time of the prior decisions and issued unfavorable decisions on the claims.  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board and requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.303 (a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain and myofascitis

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for his currently diagnosed lumbosacral strain and myofascitis.  

The Board notes that the Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection for a back condition that was denied in an August 2015 AOJ rating decision.  A December 2021 supplemental claim was denied in March 2022 because there was no new and relevant evidence submitted.  An April 2022 supplemental claim was filed and a September 2022 AOJ rating decision reconsidered but denied the claim.  A July 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision continued the denial of the claim.  

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that the Veteran complained of low back pain in March 1985 after falling on the stairs the previous day.  On examination, the Veteran had slight pain in the lower back.  The physician noted the Veteran's reflexes were "okay" and was "okay" neurologically.  The physician assessed muscular pain.  A radiographic report showed mild lumbar scoliosis to the left, vertebral bodies showed no evidence of wedging deformity, sacroiliac joint were normal, and no fracture was seen.  

An October 1993 acute medical care note reflects the Veteran reported having upper back pain for 1 day after experiencing pain while working on his car.  The Veteran stated he was diagnosed with a pulled muscle in the past.  On examination, there was tenderness on palpation and the physician assessed trapezius strain.  The Veteran was told to apply a heat pad, stretch, no lifting over 15 pounds, prescribed pain medication, and told to return to the clinic as needed.  

In December 1993, the Veteran complained of upper back pain that had persisted for 2 days.  He reported he felt pain while lifting weights and stated it was difficult to put his hands over his head.  On examination, the physician noted there were no spasms and the Veteran was diagnosed with trapezius strain.  He was prescribed pain medication and told to return to the clinic as needed.  

Periodic medical examinations, including an April 1995 retirement examination, reflect the Veteran had normal spine evaluations, with the Veteran denying recurrent back pain.  

A December 2007 treatment note from Total Orthopaedic Care reflects the Veteran was receiving physical therapy for a work incident.  He stated he began having pain in his low back area since October 15, 2007, after an incident on his job as a police officer.  The Veteran stated he was participating in a training in a prone position, and a partner lifted him by his arms resulting in acute pain in the low back area.  He reported he went to the ER the next day and was off work for 40 days.  

A July 2015 VA back examination noted a 1985 diagnosis of lumbosacral strain and a 2007 diagnosis of lumbar myofascitis.  The Veteran reported a gradual onset of low back pain while on active duty that has gotten progressively worse.  The examiner opined it was less likely than not the Veteran's lower back pain was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The rationale was that while the STRs contain documentation of complaints, treatment and diagnosis related to the claimed condition in March 1985, the Veteran's separation examination showed no residual complaints of low back pain.  The examiner also noted that in October 2007, the Veteran experienced a work-related accident resulting in a diagnosis of lumbar myofascitis with low back pain.  The examiner stated that based on the available data, the Veteran's claimed condition is less likely than not caused by the in-service injury.  

An October 2015 MRI of the lumbar spine showed degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy, as well as congenitally short pedicles predisposing to spinal stenosis.  

A January 2022 x-ray of the lumbar spine found 6 lumbar type vertebra present with small vestigial ribs at L1, mild left convex curvature of lumbar spine with apex at L3-L4, severe lower lumbar facet degeneration and mild lower lumbar disc degeneration, preserved vertebral body heights without significant compression deformity, and no abnormal translational motion with flexion/extension or acute fracture.  

A February 2022 CT of the lumbar spine showed mild congenital canal or foraminal stenosis at L2-L3.  

Private treatment records from Baylor Scott & While Medical Center received in December 2022 reflect the Veteran was seen and treated for back complaints.  Likewise, VA treatment records show that the Veteran has had ongoing complaints and treatment for chronic back pain.

Based on the entirety of the medical evidence, the Board finds that service connection for a back disability is not warranted as there is no competent medical evidence to support a connection between the Veteran's current back pain and diagnoses and his military service.  While the STRs show the Veteran complained of and was treated for an incident in service that caused back pain in 1985, periodic medical examinations after that, including his separation examination in 1995, reflect the Veteran denied having recurrent back pain or any back disorder.  Additionally, the VA examiner opined the Veteran's current back pain is less likely than not caused by the 1985 in-service injury as there were no further complaints or treatment for back pain prior to separation, and in 2007 the Veteran reported his back pain began after an incident at work in October 2007.  

While the Board acknowledges the current presence of a back disability, and the Veteran's assertion that it began in service, the preponderance of the evidence does not support the claim.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), the specific issue in this case, the etiology of a back disability, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, particularly given the absence of evidence of the disorder in service or until two years later.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).  The Veteran is not shown to have medical expertise or experience in this area.  In sum, his statements as to etiology in this case are not competent and therefore lack probative value.

To the extent the Veteran contends his low back symptoms persisted since service, the Board finds his account to lack credibility.  The Veteran's discharge examination was silent for any findings, and the first time the Veteran was seen for any back complaints after service was more than a decade after discharge, in relation to a work-related injury.  Notably, at that time he mentioned nothing about a prior history of back pain.  It was not until he filed for compensation that he began to report back pain since service.  The Board finds his contemporaneous account in 2007 to undermine the credibility of his later account with respect to the onset of his current disorder.

As the evidence is not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

2. Entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine (claimed as bulging disc C3-C4 and C5-C6)

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for his currently diagnosed degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine.  

The Board notes that the Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection for a neck disorder that was denied in an August 2015 AOJ rating decision.  A December 2021 supplemental claim was denied in March 2022 because there was no new and relevant evidence submitted.  An April 2022 supplemental claim was filed and a September 2022 AOJ rating decision reconsidered but denied the claim.  A July 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision continued the denial of the claim.  

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that in June 1994 the Veteran complained of pain in the right side and shoulder area of his neck.  The examiner noted there was no history of trauma and the Veteran could not touch his chin to his chest.  He reported hurting the area during physical training the morning before.  He stated he could not turn his neck without having pain.  On examination, his range of motion was decreased, and he could not turn his head to the left or right without obvious pain.  He was assessed with a possible pulled neck muscle.  Additional notes reflect the Veteran was doing sit-ups the day before and later in the day developed tightness and stiffness in the right side of the neck.  The Veteran stated he self-treated with some improvement in the morning.  The physician assessed mild right trap strain and put the Veteran on a 1-week profile and told to return to the clinic if not improved.  

There are no further STRs showing complaints or treatment for neck pain and the Veteran had a normal spine and other musculoskeletal evaluation during his April 1995 separation examination.  

Private treatment records show that the Veteran reported ongoing neck pain.  A February 2022 cervical spine MRI found multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes present.  VA treatment records reflect the Veteran experienced intermittent neck pain.  

A March 2022 VA neck examination shows a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis.  The Veteran reported the condition began in 1990 as a result of physical training exercises and his current symptoms consisted of increased dull neck pain with stiffness.  The examiner opined it was less likely than not the Veteran's current degenerative arthritis was incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  The rationale was that there was a sole complaint of a pulled neck muscle in 1994 that was likely an acute event with no lasting sequelae as there were no follow-up treatments nor diagnosis made.  The examiner also noted there is no evidence of chronicity of care and the symptoms are subjective in nature.  

An August 2022 VA opinion reflects it was less likely than not the Veteran's current neck disorder was incurred in or caused by the pulled neck muscle and upper back complaints during service.  The Board notes that the Veteran complained of upper back pain in October 1993 after working on his car and in December 1993, 2 days after lifting weights.  The rationale included several cites to articles by Cedars Sinai and the Mayo Clinic on the causes of degenerative disc disease and osteoarthritis.  The examiner noted that with the Veteran's last service being in 1995, his degenerative joint disease is likely caused by aging and wear and tear.  The examiner also listed several factors that can cause discs to degenerate including age, daily activities and sports, repeated stress on the joints, genetics, and bone deformities to name a few.  

An August 2022 VA cervical spine x-ray showed an unremarkable x-ray of the visualized cervical spine.  

Lastly, the August 2022 VA examiner opined it is less likely than not the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine is due to related to specific exposure event experienced by the Vietnam during service in Southwest Asia.  The rationale was that degenerative arthritis is a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis due to the mechanical process of the joints over time, wear and tear with aging, and physical training.

Based on the entirety of the medical evidence, the Board finds that service connection for a neck disability is not warranted as there is no competent medical evidence to support a connection between the Veteran's current degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine and his military service.  While the STRs show the Veteran complained of and was treated for neck pain in 1994 after physical training, there were no further complaints or treatment noted and his separation examination in 1995 shows the Veteran denied having any spine or musculoskeletal issues.  Additionally, the VA examiner opined the Veteran's current neck disorder is less likely than not caused by an event or injury in service and more likely due to wear and tear, age, and physical activities.  Additionally, the examiner stated the Veteran's 1994 complaint of a pulled neck muscle was likely an acute event with no lasting sequelae as there was no further treatment or complaints.

While the Board acknowledges the current presence of a neck disability, and the Veteran's assertion that it began in service, the preponderance of the evidence does not support the claim.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), the specific issue in this case, the etiology of a back disability, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, particularly given the absence of evidence of the disorder in service or until two years later.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).  The Veteran is not shown to have medical expertise or experience in this area.  In sum, his statements as to etiology in this case are not competent and therefore lack probative value.

As the evidence is not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability ratings.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, when the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial disability rating assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of "staged rating" is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  Staged ratings are also appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  

3. Entitlement to an increased rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease 

The Veteran asserts that his GERD disability symptoms warrant a higher rating than the 10 percent evaluation currently assigned.  The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection in August 2021 that was granted in an October 2021 RO rating decision.  

The Veteran's GERD has been rated as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346.  Hyphenated codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Here, the use of DC 7399-7346 reflects that there is no diagnostic code specifically applicable to the Veteran's service-connected GERD, and that the disability has been rated by analogy to hernia hiatal under DC 7346.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

VA revised the schedule of ratings for the digestive system (38 C.F.R. § 4.114), effective May 19, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19.735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  One revision was the creation of a specific diagnostic code for GERD, DC 7206.  Notably, DC 7346 was also amended.  The relevant review period for this increased rating claim is from August 24, 2021, (the date of receipt of the Veteran's increased rating claim) to February 3, 2023, (the date notification was mailed of the February 2023 rating decision).  As the creation of DC 7206 and the amendments to DC 7346 post-date this review period, they are not for application in this appeal. Accordingly, the prior version of DC 7346 that was in effect during the review period will be applied.

Pursuant to DC 7399-7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation, but at less severity.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  The maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7399-7346.

A September 2021 VA examination notes a 1993 diagnosis of GERD.  The Veteran described his current symptoms as heartburn, excessive saliva, a sour taste in his mouth when lying down, and occasional vomiting.  His treatment plan included medications.  The examiner noted the Veteran's symptoms as persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux, 2 episodes of nausea and vomiting per year lasting less than 1 day.  The Veteran reported one of his medications caused constipation.  The examiner noted that GERD had no impact on the Veteran's ability to work; and there was no need for any follow up with the primary care provider regarding any life-threatening findings.

VA treatment records reflect the Veteran was prescribed medication for his GERD disability and was on stable on said medication.

Based on a review of the medical evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence does not support a higher rating is warranted as his symptoms do not meet the requirements for a 30 percent rating.  Notably, the criteria for rating GERD are progressive.  Although the Veteran suffers from persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain, he does not suffer from dysphagia which is required for a 30 percent rating.  Additionally, there is no evidence the Veteran's GERD symptoms are productive of considerable impairment of health.  The VA examiner opined that GERD had no impact on the Veteran's ability to work and no abnormal findings were seen on examination.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of gastrointestinal discomfort however his disability symptoms are more consistent with the criteria for a 10 percent rating.  Therefore, a rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is denied.

Accordingly, as the evidence in not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

4. Entitlement to an increased rating for bilateral hearing loss, which is currently 0 percent disabling

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for his service-connected bilateral hearing loss disability.  The Board notes that service connection was granted in a February 2018 RO rating decision and a noncompensable evaluation was assigned.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision.

Hearing loss is rated under Diagnostic Code 6100, which sets out the criteria for rating hearing impairment using puretone threshold averages and speech discrimination scores.  Numeric designations are assigned based upon a mechanical use of tables found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  Acevedo-Escobar v. West, 12 Vet. App. 9 (1998); Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Audiometric results are matched on Table VI to find the numeric designation. Then, the designations are matched with Table VII to find the percentage rating to be assigned for the hearing impairment.  To evaluate the degree of disability for service-connected hearing loss, the Rating Schedule establishes eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

The provisions of § 4.86 address exceptional patterns of hearing loss which are identified when each of the puretone thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 55 decibels or more, or when the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

A September 2021 VA audiological examination shows puretone thresholds in the right ear were 25, 30, 40, and 50 for 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz respectively.  The results of the VA audiogram show an average puretone threshold of 36 decibels for the right ear with a speech discrimination score using Maryland CNC of 96%.  Puretone thresholds in the left ear were 25, 25, 40, and 45 for 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz respectively.  The results of the VA audiogram show an average puretone threshold of 34 decibels for the right ear with a speech discrimination score using Maryland CNC of 96%.  

Those VA audiometric findings warrant a numeric designation of Level I auditory acuity for the right ear, and Level I for the left ear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Table VI.  The point of intersection on Table VII shows a level of hearing loss consistent with a 0 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  The audiological results do not satisfy the criteria for a compensable rating due to any exceptional hearing loss pattern.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

Based on the audiometric findings above, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability does not warrant a compensable rating. 

Accordingly, as the evidence in not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

5. Entitlement to an increased rating for headaches, which is currently 0 percent disabling

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for his service-connected headache disability.  

The Board notes that the Veteran initially filed service connection for headaches in October 2017 which was denied in a February 2018 RO rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision, and it became final.  The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim on May 4, 2022, and a March 2023 RO rating decision granted service connection for headaches as related to the service-connected disability of chronic sinusitis.  

The Veteran's headaches are rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100, for migraine.  Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks than the criteria for a 10 percent rating.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  

A June 2022 VA headache examination reflects a diagnosis of headaches.  The Veteran reported having a headache every morning treated with over-the-counter medication as needed.  The Veteran's symptoms include headache pain in the forehead area and/or behind the head.  Non-headache symptoms were noted as sensitivity to light with typical head pain lasting 1-2 days.  When asked to indicate the frequency, on average, of prostrating attacks over the last several months, the examiner noted the Veteran had prostrating attacks of headache pain with less frequent attacks that were not productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran's headache condition did not impact his ability to work.  The examiner stated the Veteran does not have migraine headaches but did state his headaches occurred with his service-connected chronic maxillary sinusitis and his allergic rhinitis.  The examiner noted the Veteran was very congested on the phone and had a headache.  The examiner summarized that the headaches he has tend to occur due to this allergies/rhinitis and his chronic sinusitis.  

In February 2023, the RO requested clarification from the June 2022 VA examiner on whether the prostrating headache attacks described at the June 2022 VA examination are separate and distinct from the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, or if the examiner could state if the prostrating headache attacks overlap with the allergic rhinitis symptoms such that the two conditions could not be delineated due to symptom overlap.  

In a February 2023 addendum, the examiner stated the headaches occur with the service-connected chronic maxillary sinusitis and his allergic rhinitis.  The examiner stated the headache attacks overlap with the allergic rhinitis symptoms and cannot be delineated because they occur as symptomatology of allergic rhinitis.  The examiner went on to list the most common symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which included frequent headaches.  

Based on the available medical evidence, the Board concludes that the Veteran's prostrating attacks have occurred with less frequent attacks during the appeal period, which is in line with criteria for a noncompensable rating under DC 8100.  

The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms that he experienced, and it is presumed he did so during the VA examination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Based on the Veteran's reports, the examiner concluded the Veteran experienced less frequent attacks over the last several months, corresponding to the criteria for a noncompensable rating under DC 8100.  Therefore, the claim for entitlement to a compensable rating for headaches must be denied.

Accordingly, as the evidence in not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

6. Entitlement to an increased rating for allergic rhinitis, which is currently 10 percent disabling

The Veteran is seeking a rating in excess of the 10 percent evaluation currently assigned for his allergic rhinitis disability.  

The Board notes that the Veteran initially filed a claim for an increased (compensable) rating in October 2017 which was denied in a February 2018 RO rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal that rating decision, and it became final.  The Veteran submitted a new claim for increase on August 24, 2021, which was granted in an October 2021 RO rating decision and assigned a 10 percent evaluation effective August 24, 2021, the date the claim was received.  

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is rated under Diagnostic Code 6522.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  Under Diagnostic Code 6522, allergic rhinitis warrants a 10 percent rating when there are no nasal polyps, but there is greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A maximum rating of 30 percent is warranted when polyps are present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.

A September 2021 VA examination reflects a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.  The Veteran reported that since its onset the condition has gotten worse, and he has symptoms all year long.  He described his current symptoms as drainage, nasal congestion, sneezing, and occasional coughing.  Treatment includes allergy medication.  The examiner noted the Veteran has both sinusitis and rhinitis, with sinusitis in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses and only detected by imaging studies.  The examiner found that the Veteran had greater than 50% obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, as well as permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, both due to rhinitis.  The examiner stated the Veteran did not have complete obstruction of the left or right side, nasal polyps, or granulomatous conditions due to rhinitis.  The examiner remarked that the Veteran had inflamed reddened nasal passages bilaterally on examination with nasal drip.  

VA and private treatment records document the Veteran's ongoing treatment for symptoms of allergic rhinitis; however, there is no indication in the treatment records that the Veteran has had nasal polyps at any time during the appeal.  As indicated in the rating criteria, a higher 30 percent evaluation is not warranted unless the evidence shows a diagnosis of nasal polyps.  Therefore, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 10 percent for allergic rhinitis is not warranted and the claim must be denied.  

Accordingly, as the evidence in not in approximate balance but is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine enunciated in 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b) is not applicable.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Effective Date

Under governing law, the effective date for a grant of compensation will be the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Id.  As relevant herein, a claim or application is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  Unless specifically provided, the effective date will be assigned on the basis of the facts as found.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (a).

Under VA regulation prior to March 2015, any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA, from a claimant or the claimant's representative, may be considered an informal claim, provided that it identified the benefit sought.  For claims received on or after March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations governing how to file a claim.  The effect of the amendment was to standardize the process of filing claims, and the forms accepted, to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of claims processing, and to eliminate the concept of informal claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155; 79 Fed. Reg. 57660-01.  However, prior to the effective date of the amendment, an informal claim was any communication or action, indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA.  An informal claim must identify the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a claimant "continuously pursues" an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options (such as a supplemental claim) within one year of the issuance of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1). However, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2).

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to May 4, 2022, for a grant of service connection for headaches

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than May 4, 2022, for the grant of service connection for his headache disability.  

On May 4, 2022, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for migraine headaches.  A March 2023 RO rating decision granted service connection for headaches (claimed as migraines) and assigned an effective date of May 4, 2022, the date the VA received the claim.  In an April 19, 2023, VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, the Veteran indicated he wanted the effective date and rating evaluation reviewed.  He reiterated his desire on his July 2024 VA Form 10182.

The record does not show any evidence of a claim, formal or informal, from the Veteran or a representative seeking service connection for headaches prior to May 4, 2022.  Moreover, in this case, the Veteran's claim was submitted after March 2015 and thus a claim on a specific form needed to be filed.  A review of the record shows that the first formal claim for service connection for headaches was received at VA on May 4, 2022.  Therefore, the claim for an effective date earlier than May 4, 2022 must be denied.  

8. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 24, 2021, for a grant of service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than August 24, 2021, for the grant of service connection for his GERD disability.

On August 24, 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for GERD.  An October 2021 RO rating decision granted service connection for GERD and assigned a rating of 10 percent effective August 24, 2021, the date VA received the claim.  In an October 2022 supplemental claim, filed within one year of the date of notification of the rating decision granting service connection, the Veteran indicating he disagreed with the evaluation and effective date assigned for the grant of service connection for GERD.  He reiterated his desire on his July 2024 VA Form 10182.

The record does not show any evidence of a claim, formal or informal, from the Veteran or a representative seeking service connection for GERD prior to August 24, 2021.  Moreover, in this case, the Veteran's claim was submitted after March 2015 and thus a claim on a specific form needed to be filed.  A review of the record shows that the first formal claim for service connection for GERD was received at VA on August 24, 2021.  Therefore, the claim for an effective date earlier than August 24, 2021 must be denied.  

9. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 24, 2021, for the grant of a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis

The Veteran is seeking an effective date earlier than August 24, 2021, for the grant of a 10 percent increased rating for his allergic rhinitis disability.

An effective date for increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); see also Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997).

On August 24, 2021, the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased (compensable) rating for his allergic rhinitis disability.  An intent to file a claim was not submitted or received prior to the August 24, 2021, formal claim.  Therefore, the appropriate effective date for the claim for an increased rating that led to the grant of a 10 percent rating is August 24, 2021.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).  The Board notes that the Veteran has not given a specific reason for why he believes an earlier effective date is warranted.  Based on the history, the record shows that the Veteran had previously been denied an increased (compensable) rating for allergic rhinitis in a February 2018 RO rating decision, however, the Veteran did not appeal that decision within one year of notification and that decision became final.  As noted previously, an intent to file a claim was not received prior to the August 24, 2021 formal claim and therefore that is the appropriate effective date for the grant of an increased 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis.

As such, the Board concludes that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to August 24, 2021, for the grant of a 10 percent rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.
