ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that sleep apnea began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1961 to August 1964.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that under the AMA, a Veteran may switch Board review options by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(c)(2). In this case, the Veteran was sent a notification letter in August 2024 notifying him of the right to request a different Board review option. The Veteran submitted an August 2024 correspondence and waived his right to select a different Board option. Therefore, the Board will proceed with adjudicating the claim.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea, to include as secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)

The Veteran contends that his sleep apnea is due to exposure to MOS related toxins. Alternatively, the Veteran contends his sleep apnea is secondary to his COPD.

Under applicable law, service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A lay witness is competent to testify as to the occurrence of an in-service injury or incident where such issue is factual in nature. Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993).  In some cases, lay evidence will also be competent and credible on the issues of diagnosis and etiology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  A layperson is competent to identify a medical condition where the condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007).

Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is approximately at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sleep apnea, and evidence shows that exposure to MOS related toxins occurred, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

The April 2024 VA examination shows the Veteran was not diagnosed with sleep apnea until May 2011, over four decades after separation from service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of loud snoring, apneic episodes, frequent sleep interruptions, restless sleep, and chronic daytime fatigue intermittently over the years, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that these symptoms were manifestations of sleep apnea. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2024. The examiner opined the Veteran's sleep apnea is less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner noted the claim is based upon the claimed exposure to asbestos, chemical weapons agents, silica dust, environmental hazards in the water, air, or soil, and firefighting foam. The duration of exposure is unknown. The route of exposure is described as inhalation and dermal. The frequency of exposure is not specified. The rationale is that current medical literature does not support a causal relationship between exposures to MOS weapons infantry, asbestos, chemical weapons agents, silica dust, environmental hazards in the water, air, or soil, or firefighting foam with developing OSA. OSA is caused by partial or complete mechanical obstruction of the upper airway during sleep which results in reduction in blood oxygen saturation levels. According to Mayo Clinic, risk factors for OSA include excess weight, being male, and age. There is no evidence in the treatment records that the Veteran developed upper airway obstruction during sleep due to toxic exposures. Records indicate history of obesity which likely contributed to developing OSA.

The Board finds the April 2024 VA opinion to be probative and dispositive of the nexus question presented in this case. In particular, the April 2024 VA opinion reflects the expert's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data. The opinion contains clear conclusions with supporting data and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. The expert was familiar with the Veteran's pertinent medical history. The expert provided a thorough and detailed opinion. The opinion is the product of reliable principles and methods, and is the result of principles and methods reliably applied to facts. As there is no medical opinion of record to the contrary, the April 2024 medical opinion is the most probative evidence of record.

The Veteran believes the claimed sleep apnea is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the April 2024 VA opinion.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
