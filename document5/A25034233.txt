ORDER

A waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pension benefits in the amount of $254,454.80 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The overpayment was not due to the Veteran's fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith.

2. Recovery of the debt in this case would likely cause the Veteran to not be able to provide the basic needs for himself.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Recovery of the overpayment of VA pension benefits in the amount of $254,454.80 would be contrary to the principles of equity and good conscience. 38 U.S.C. § 5302; 38 C.F.R. § 1.965.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had service in the United States Marine Corps from December 1968 to September 1970. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2021 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness by the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC).

The Board notes that the Veteran was deemed to be not competent to handle disbursement of VA funds by way of a November 2010 decision. A fiduciary, the Veteran's sister, was appointed to handle the Veteran's benefit claims before VA. Hereinafter in this decision references to the Veteran's action can be interchangeably considered as actions on his behalf by his fiduciary.

In the December 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 17, 2024. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 COWC decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the December 17, 2024 hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after COWC issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Before moving to the matter of whether a waiver is warranted, the Board will first clarify the amount of the debt at issue. The Veteran was initially awarded VA pension benefits in March 2004, effective December 1, 2003. A May 2005 memorandum shows VA was informed that the Veteran and his spouse had separated in June 2004. The Veteran was not being paid any extra benefit for his spouse. Over the years since, the Veteran and his spouse have remained separated, but they did not divorce. The Veteran's pension benefits continued. 

In November 2016, a field examiner reported to the VA Pension Management Center (PMC) that the Veteran had begun receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration in September 2015, and that he had moved to a different facility. In December 2016, the PMC notified the Veteran of proposed changes to his pension entitlement based upon changes to his countable income. In March 2017, the PMC provided final notice that the proposed change was taking place. A $26,490.30 overpayment was created at that time. In May 2017, the Veteran requested a waiver of this debt through the filing of a VA Form 5655, Financial Status Report (FSR). However, following the receipt of additional financial information, the PMC notified the Veteran in November 2017 that a portion of his pension benefits were being reinstated retroactive to February 2016. This resulted in a $19,986.00 award, which reduced the overpayment to $6,504.30.

In July 2018, VA received information indicating the Veteran had been paying for insurance for his estranged wife and two disabled adult children since the date of estrangement. In July 2018, the PMC wrote to the Veteran and proposed to terminate his pension benefit effective December 1, 2006. The PMC requested information related to the spouse's income and expenses. The fiduciary responded with some information in September 2018. The fiduciary also explained that the Veteran provided support by way of insurance to the wife and adult disabled children for a time, but that due to the rising cost of insurance, the Veteran had to ask her to find her own. The Veteran was in a facility to help care for him by that time and a copy of a medical statement showing the diagnosis as major neurocognitive disorder was also submitted. In March 2019, the PMC notified the Veteran that the proposed action was taking place because the requested information was not provided. The Veteran's VA pension was terminated effective December 1, 2006. In March 2019, the VA Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran that his debt had increased by $223,908.10 and the balance was now $230,412.40, which is the sum of the $6,504.30 debt and the $223,908.10 debt. The Veteran submitted another FSR waiver request in May 2019. 

In December 2020, the PMC sent another letter to the Veteran indicating December 1, 2006 was the incorrect date for pension termination and it should have been December 1, 2003, the date of his initial pension award. The PMC proposed to terminate the pension effective on that date. In April 2021, the PMC notified the Veteran that the proposed action was taking place. This created an additional $24,042.40 overpayment. In May 2021, prior to the COWC decision on appeal, the DMC notified the Veteran of the total debt amount of $254,454.80, which is the sum of the prior debts plus the additional $24,042.40. 

The Board recognizes the COWC decision on appeal suggests the debt at issue is $250,398.40. The record reflects this is not the accurate amount. Thus, the Board will consider whether a waiver is warranted for the $254,454.80 debt.

In its decision, the COWC found no fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the Veteran. The Board will not disturb this favorable finding.  

In cases where fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the Veteran's part with respect to the creation of the overpayment at issue has not been demonstrated, and, therefore, waiver is not precluded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a), the Board must determine whether recovery of the indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience, thereby permitting waiver under 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a). In making this determination, consideration is given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) fault of debtor (where actions of the debtors contribute to the creation of the debt); (2) balancing of faults (weighing fault of the debtor vs. the fault of VA); (3) undue hardship (whether collection would deprive the debtor or family of basic necessities); (4) defeat the purpose (whether withholding of benefits or recovery would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended); (5) unjust enrichment (failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the debtor); and (6) changing position to one's detriment (reliance on VA benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right or incurrence of a legal obligation). See 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a). 

The Board initially finds the fault is not a significant factor in the creation of the debt at issue. VA was aware that the Veteran was married but separated throughout the period during which pension benefits were being received. Confusion was created when it was reported that the Veteran was paying an insurance benefit for his wife and children, after which more information was requested. VA took action because the requested information was not provided. However, as noted the Veteran was deemed incompetent many years ago and his fiduciary was limited in the information she would have had dating back to 2003. A December 2024 statement from the nursing facility in which the Veteran resides confirms that he has resided there since October 2021 as a long term patient and that he was in hospice care. The Board understands that there would be no feasible way for the fiduciary to obtain additional information from the Veteran at this juncture. The Board finds, based upon the unique factual scenario in this case, that fault in the creation of this debt on the part of the Veteran is not a factor. Moreover, VA's action in response to the lack of information was not in error, so VA is also not at fault.

The Board also finds that recovery of the overpayment would not defeat the purpose of the benefit because the Veteran appears to have received additional VA pension for many years after he was entitled to such benefits. Thus, the Veteran was receiving benefits he was not legally entitled to receive. Recovery would, therefore, not defeat the purpose of the benefit. Similarly, the Veteran was unjustly enriched by receiving benefits to which he was not entitled. There is also no evidence of the Veteran changing position to his detriment due to his reliance upon receipt of the VA benefits at issue. 

However, the Board does find that the collection of the overpayment would cause undue hardship to the Veteran. Again, the Veteran submitted several FSRs in this case. The May 2017 form shows he was receiving retirement and SSA benefits and his VA benefits at that time. He reported expenses related to housing, utilities, Medicare and insurance for his wife and adult disabled children. His total monthly income was listed as $1,719.23 and his monthly expenses were $2,638.25.

Circumstances had changed by May 2019 and this FSR no longer showed the Veteran paying insurance expenses for his wife and disabled children. This change was confirmed on the record at the time of the Board hearing in this case. This FSR showed the Veteran's receipt of SSA and retirement benefits only, as his pension had been terminated. His total monthly income was $1,267.29. His monthly expenses were the cost of his housing, his cable and phone, which totaled $1,669.00 per month. Thus, at this time there was a deficit. At the Board hearing it was confirmed that the fiduciary, the Veteran's sister, has to help with his bills.

Most recently, in December 2024, just after the Board hearing, the FSR shows a monthly income of $1,306.91 from retirement and SSA, and expenses of $1,268 for the nursing home, Medicaid, and clothing needs. This shows a $38 surplus. The money noted to be in the Veteran's bank account was $2,592.79 as of December 2024. He had no other assets.

Based upon the foregoing, it appears that collecting the debt at issue would likely cause an inability for the Veteran to provide the basic necessities of life for himself. Considering his health and lack of any ability to make additional income, the Board finds undue financial hardship, as defined by VA regulation, in this case. 

The Board finds that a waiver is warranted in this case because it would be against equity and good conscience for VA to collect this debt. Thus, the $254,454.80 debt is waived. The appeal is granted.
