DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on December 23, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the December 23, 2020, medical services provided by the appellant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on December 23, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105; 38?C.F.R. ยง?20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In June 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the Veteran electing the Direct Review docket to review a January 2021 decisional letter issued by a VA AOJ. 

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on December 23, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the December 23, 2020, medical services.  In a May 2021 letter, the AOJ advised the Veteran that the appeal for medical services provided on December 23, 2020, by the appellant was approved after secondary administrative review.  The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed according to VA policy. 

A May 2021 explanation of payment reported payment was issued in the amount of $100.00 for the claim. If the amount paid for the December 23, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the Veteran, he may request review of that May 2021 decision. 

(Continued on the next page)?

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the claimed medical services constitutes a reversal of the January 2021 denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Veteran disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38?U.S.C. ยง?7105(d).
