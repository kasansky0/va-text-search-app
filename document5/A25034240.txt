ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 29, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent rating for residuals of prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy (residuals of prostate cancer) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded entitlement to service connection for residuals of prostate cancer with a noncompensable rating from August 19, 2022, the date his original claim for entitlement to service connection was received.

2. Since the July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for an increased rating for prostate cancer residuals thereafter.

3. During the appeal period, the Veteran's residuals of prostate cancer has been rated as noncompensable prior to August 29, 2023, and 40 percent disabling thereafter.

4. At no time during the appeal period from August 19, 2022, to August 29, 2023, was it factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of prostate cancer resulted in awakening to void five or more times per night or a daytime voiding interval less than one hour warranting a 40 percent disability rating.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to August 29, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent disability rating for residuals of prostate cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500, 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7528.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1971 to October 1997.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to an increased disability rating for residuals of prostate cancer most recently addressed in a July 2023 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 29, 2023 for the award of a 40 percent disability rating for prostate cancer residuals is denied

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The law pertaining to the effective date of a VA claim for increase in disability mandates that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date for the increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claim for increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, such specifically provides that the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if any application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). If the increase became ascertainable more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, then the proper effective date would be the date of claim. In a case where the increase became ascertainable after the filing of the claim, then the effective date would be the date of increase. See generally Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has indicated that it is axiomatic that the fact that must be found, in order for entitlement to an increase in disability compensation to arise, is that the service-connected disability must have increased in severity to a degree warranting an increase in compensation. See Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511, 519 (1992) (noting that, under section 5110(b)(2), which provides that the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, "the only cognizable 'increase' for this purpose is one the next disability level" provided by law for the particular disability). Thus, determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable." Id. at 521.

Additionally, under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). In the case of continuously pursued claims, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options, including a Supplemental Claim, request for Higher-Level Review, or appeal to the Board, within one year of the issuance of the decision. Id.

The Veteran asserts an earlier effective date for the award of a 40 percent disability rating for his service-connected residuals of prostate cancer is warranted. His representative argues that the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since he was granted entitlement to service connection, thus the 40 percent disability rating should be from the date entitlement to service connection was filed and awarded.

The Veteran filed his initial claim for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer on August 30, 2022, the date from which service connection was awarded. Within one year of the July 2023 rating decision awarding entitlement to service connection, the Veteran filed an Intent to File and Supplemental Claim for an increased rating. Based on the procedural history, the Board finds that, since the receipt of the Veteran's original claim, he has continuously pursued his claim for a higher initial disability rating for his residuals of prostate cancer.

The Veteran's residuals of prostate cancer are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.116, Diagnostic Code 7528. Diagnostic Code 7528 provides that malignant neoplasms of the genitourinary system are to be rated at a 100 percent disability rating. The Note following Diagnostic Code 7528 provides that following the cessation of surgical, x-ray, anti-neo-plastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure, the rating of 100 percent shall continue with a mandatory VA examination at the expiration of six months. Any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, rate on residuals as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is predominant.

As noted above, under Diagnostic Code 7528, if there has been no local reoccurrence or metastasis, then the Veteran's cancer residuals are to be rated as voiding dysfunction or renal dysfunction, whichever is the predominant disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115A, 4.115B.

Here the Veteran's predominant disability is related to voiding dysfunction.

Voiding dysfunction is rated under the three subcategories of urine leakage, urinary frequency, and obstructed voiding. Regarding urine leakage, the Board notes that a 20 percent evaluation requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 timers per day. A 40 percent evaluation requires the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day. A 60 percent evaluation requires the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, Continual Urine Leakage, Post-Surgical Urinary Diversion, Urinary Incontinence, and Stress Incontinence.

Regarding urinary frequency, the Board notes that a 10 percent evaluation is warranted with daytime voiding intervals between 2 and 3 hours or awakening to void 2 times per night. A 20 percent evaluation is warranted with daytime voiding intervals between 1 and 2 hours or awakening to void 3 to 4 times per night. A 40 percent evaluation is warranted with daytime voiding intervals of less than an hour, or awakening to void 5 or more times per night. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, Urinary Frequency.

Finally, for obstructed voiding, a non-compensable disability rating contemplates obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilation one to two times per year. A 10 percent disability rating contemplates marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post-void residuals greater than 150 cubic centimeters (cc); (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc per second); (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; and/or (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilation every two to three months. A 30 percent rating contemplates urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

The Board has reviewed the medical treatment history in this matter along with the lay statements made by the Veteran. In doing so, the Board has confirmed that the ratings as they are currently set, are proper. The evidence of record does not support a 40 percent disability rating prior to August 29, 2023.

Regarding the noncompensable rating prior to August 29, 2023, the Veteran does not report symptoms that would warrant a compensable rating as outlined above. There is no evidence, lay or otherwise noted in any medical record that would allow for a compensable rating. This is to include all of the subcategories that are detailed above as symptoms of voiding dysfunction.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2023, in which the examiner noted that the Veteran reported no incontinence problems or other voiding dysfunction symptomology.

The first evidence during the appeal period it was factually ascertainable that a voiding dysfunction was demonstrated was during the November 2023 VA examination. The Veteran reported current symptoms of frequent urination, urinary incontinence, and frequent nighttime awakening to urinate. The voiding dysfunction caused urine leakage requiring absorbent material changed less than two times per day and increased urinary frequency with a daytime voiding interval of less than one hour and nighttime awakening to void five or more times. There is no evidence approximating the 60 percent disability rating, which requires the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day. Furthermore, renal dysfunction, nor active malignancy is not shown during the appeal period.

The March 2024 rating decision increased the Veteran's disability rating to 40 percent for prostate cancer residuals based upon the findings of the November 2023 VA examination. The increased 40 percent disability rating was assigned from August 29, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's Intent to File for Compensation, which the Board will not disturb.

As noted above, in the case of continuously pursued claims, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Here, the original claim was received August 30, 2022. The date that it was factually ascertainable during the appeal period that the Veteran met the requirements for a 40 percent disability rating for residuals of prostate cancer was November 30, 2023, the date of the VA examination demonstrating that the Veteran's voiding dysfunction approximated a 40 percent disability rating. 

As the date the entitlement to a 40 percent disability rating arose later than the filing date of August 30, 2022, the effective date is fixed in accordance with that date, November 30, 2023. However, as VA has already awarded an earlier effective date of August 29, 2023 for a 40 percent disability rating, the Board will not disturb that finding.

Therefore, based on the foregoing, the Board finds that, at no time during the appeal period prior to August 29, 2023, was it factually ascertainable that his service-connected residuals of prostate cancer resulted in a voiding dysfunction warranting a 40 percent disability rating. Thus, there is no doubt to be resolved and his claim for an effective date prior to August 29, 2023, for the award of a 40 percent disability rating for residuals of prostate cancer must be denied.
