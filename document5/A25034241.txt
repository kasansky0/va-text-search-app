DOCKET NO. 240820-467104
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

There is medical evidence diagnosing PTSD, anxiety, and depression, credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and medical evidence of a link between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD, anxiety, and depression have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1959 to August 1962. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in December 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

The Veteran initially filed a service connection claim for PTSD as a result of his in-service stressors.  

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; competent lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a) (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders); (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptoms and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f). 

However, upon review of the record, the Veteran also carries other psychiatric diagnoses such as depressed mood and anxiety. Treating each psychiatric diagnosis as a separate claim would "force a veteran to continually file new claims as medical evidence is developed during his initial claim." See Valez v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 199, 204 (2009). In light of the Court's decision in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009), the Board has re-characterized the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition. This will provide the most potentially favorable review of the Veteran's claim in keeping with the Court's holding in Clemons. 

 

In an October 2023 statement, the Veteran stated that during basic training at Ft. Dix from August to October 1959, two recruits were struck by lightning in the bivouac area and died. He found the deaths traumatizing since they were still required to train in the same area. Additionally, as part of basic training, he was subjected to dangerous situations, such as crawling under barbed wire with machine gun fire overhead, tear gas and chlorine gas. Additionally, he became stressed as he learned about various accidents that occurred during the training exercises. Furthermore, as part of STRAC Co., the Veteran was subjected to be assigned "anywhere in the world at any time." This caused additional stress and anxiety, which continued to persist later in life. Next, in serving with service members of various backgrounds, he was haunted by many past war stories, which added to his stress levels. During the summer of 1961, he witnessed the drowning of a young crew member from Baltimore. When his body was recovered, the Veteran found the discovery traumatic but was not offered any grief counseling. 

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran emphasized that witnessing the death of a young crew member from Baltimore caused long term emotional distress.  While patrolling the coast with the Marines between Charleston, South Carolina and Cape Henlopen, Delaware, a service member fell overboard. The Veteran, along with other people, dove into the water in attempts to rescue the man but to no avail. The memory of the day has haunted him ever since, causing chronic flashbacks and distress. 

The Veteran's service treatment records were silent for any complaints or diagnosis suggestive of any psychiatric condition. 

Post service, the Veteran was afforded an examination in February 2024. There, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, anxiety, and depressed mood. The examiner found that the Veteran's psychiatric disorders are related to the Veteran's reported in-service stressor events, when the Veteran witnessed the death of two soldiers by lightning in 1959 and the drowning of a crew member in 1961.  

In May 2024, the AOJ attempted to verify the Veteran's reported in-service stressors by requesting additional details about the events as the information initially provided by the Veteran did not meet the minimum level of detail needed to seek assistance from the JSRRC. See May 2024 Subsequent Development Letter. 

In response, the Veteran submitted a May 2024 correspondence indicating that between October 1959 and August 1962, he was stationed at Ft. Eustis, Virginia in the 329th Heavy Boat Company, 159 T (Transportation) Battalion, 3rd Transportation Terminal Training Group. He served on LCU's 1484, 1577, 1579 and the Captain's J Boat. While he could not remember specifically when the drowning occurred, he estimated that it was in the summer of either 1960 or 1961. The victim was known as "[A.]" who was an RFA soldier. After the recovery of his body, the Veteran began to have flashbacks of the drowning and struggles with significant feelings of guilt of not being able to save the man. Next, while the Veteran did not discuss the death of two other soldiers due to lightning strike, he indicated that he witnessed another drowning that took place in the winter of 1961 or 1962. The victim was a SP4, Regular Army service member, who drowned in the 3rd Port Area. 

Subsequently, the AOJ indicated that it required additional information in its June 2024 correspondence, as the details provided by the Veteran in his May 2024 letter remained insufficient. Despite the lack of additional details required, the AOJ attempted to verify the Veteran's reported stressors. 

In June 2024, the Records Research Center Response released negative findings. In attempts to verify the drowning of two soldiers between December 21, 1960, and April 27, 1961 assigned to the 329th Transportation Company, 11th Transportation Battalion, the requested records from the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) could not establish the claimed stressor event. Similarly, records from the NARA also could not verify the deaths of two soldiers from lightning strike for the period between August 4, 1959, and November 25, 1959. 

While the Records Research Center Response and NARA were unable to verify the claimed stressors, the Veteran's unit assignment and military occupational specialty of harbor craft crewman show the claimed stressor of witnessing the reported drowning is plausible. The Board finds that the Veteran's claimed stressor is consistent with the place, type, and circumstances of such service. Thus, there is credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304. As there is medical evidence diagnosing PTSD, anxiety, and depression, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and medical evidence of a link between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor, service connection for PTSD, anxiety, and depression is warranted.
