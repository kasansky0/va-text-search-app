DOCKET NO. 210611-165806
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to reinstatement of a TDIU, effective from February 1, 2021, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The record does not contain clear and convincing evidence of actual employability; the evidence of record also fails to demonstrate that the Veteran engaged in any substantially gainful occupation for a period of twelve consecutive months.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to reinstatement of a TDIU, effective from February 1, 2021, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.343, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps from July 1985 to January 1993. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Restoration of TDIU

Entitlement to reinstatement of a TDIU, effective from February 1, 2021

The Veteran contends that her TDIU should be reinstated. 

The Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) sets forth procedural requirements for reductions in disability compensation ratings. In the instant case, the Board finds that the procedural requirements and safeguards outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) governing rating reductions were explained to the Veteran in adequate detail in the September and November 2020 proposed reduction letters before the implementation of the February 2021 rating reduction. Thus, all procedural requirements were met.

Although the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) were met, specific to reductions of TDIU, VA regulations provide that a rating of 100 percent disability based on individual unemployability may be reduced, subject to the procedural protections of § 3.105(e), "but caution must be exercised in such a determination that actual employability is established by clear and convincing evidence." 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 (c)(1).

A finding of "actual employability" must encompass a finding that the Veteran is no longer unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). Furthermore, "[i]f a Veteran with a total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability begins to engage in a substantially gainful occupation after January 1, 1985, the veteran's rating may not be reduced solely based on such occupation unless the veteran maintains the occupation for a period of twelve consecutive months." 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 (c)(2).

In determining the nature of the Veteran's employment, VA regulations explain that marginal employment shall not be considered "substantially gainful employment." Marginal employment is defined as employment where a Veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); see also Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). Marginal employment may also be found in some cases when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold, such as cases where there is employment in a protected environment, such as a family business or sheltered workshop. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

The Court defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).

Although VA regulations do not define the term "sheltered," the regulations governing the SSA are the most closely analogous to those applicable to VA's adjudication process. Indeed, SSA regulations use similar terms, such as "sheltered or special environment" and "sheltered employment." While not binding, SSA policy and regulations do provide guidance. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000).

An SSA policy statement on determining whether work constitutes "substantial gainful activity" gives the following definition for sheltered employment: "Sheltered employment is employment provided for handicapped individuals in a protected environment under an institutional program." SSR 83-33, 1983 SSR LEXIS 34. In addition, SSA regulations suggest that work in a sheltered workshop may include special conditions to take an individual's impairment into account. Examples of the special conditions that may relate to such impairment include, but are not limited to, situations in which an individual (1) requires and receives special assistance from other employees in the process of performing his or her work; (2) is allowed to work irregular hours or take frequent rest periods; (3) is provided with special equipment or were assigned work especially suited to his or her impairment; (4) is able to work only because of specially arranged circumstances, for example, other persons helped him or her prepare for or get to and from his or her work; (5) is permitted to work at a lower standard of productivity or efficiency than other employees; or (6) is given the opportunity to work despite his or her impairment because of a family relationship, past association with an employer, or an employer's concern for his or her welfare. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1573. 

In a September 2020 letter and November 2020 rating decision, the AOJ informed the Veteran that VA had received information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicating that she had earned wages above the poverty line in 2019. The AOJ also indicated that the Veteran had not verified her employment status. The AOJ stated that VA proposed to discontinue her entitlement to a TDIU, which would reduce her disability compensation to 70 percent. It was indicated that the discontinuance would be made effective on a future date.

The Board further notes that the AOJ did not include any evidence from SSA in the Veteran's claim. The Veteran's claims file during the evidence window does not include any information from SSA that served the basis for the discontinuance of TDIU benefits. 

The Veteran also returned an employment questionnaire. The employment questionnaire indicated that the Veteran did administrative support. See December 2020 Employment Questionnaire. The Veteran indicated that she was working 32 hours a week, but that she needed to take both paid medical leave and unpaid leave for significant periods of time. See id; see also December 2020 Statement (January 2019 thru February 2019, "I was employed at McKinsey but was out on medical leave due to a Chron's flare. My pay dropped late Jan., early Feb. from that time until 10 June I was still an active employee without pay. Once I was medically released to go back I worked with pay from 10 June to 3 July 2019. I never returned back to work for the remainder of the year."). This information was confirmed by her former employer in an August 2021 letter.

After considering the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's TDIU was improperly discontinued and should be reinstated. Initially, the Board notes that the information received from SSA is not included in the record before the Board, and the Board cannot conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence of earnings above the poverty threshold. Moreover, the evidence provided by the Veteran indicated that she did have some periods of employment; however, the record does not demonstrate that the Veteran maintained any occupation for a period of 12 consecutive months as required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 (c)(2). 

Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that shows that the Veteran has engaged in any other substantial gainful occupation for a period of 12 consecutive months. Lastly, the Board finds that the administrative work that the Veteran did with her former employer was marginal because of the amount of medical and unpaid leave she took and not substantially gainful employment. Therefore, the discontinuance of the Veteran's TDIU was not proper. Thus, reinstatement of TDIU is granted, effective from February 1, 2021.
