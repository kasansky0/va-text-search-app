REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for migraines is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from December 1982 to July 1989. 

The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for migraines in January 2023 that was denied in a March 2023 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal. 

Thereafter, the Veteran attempted to switch his VA Form 10182 (Board Appeal) review option in May 2024 and October 2024. However, these requests were not timely. The law requires requests to change Board Appeal review options be submitted within 1 year of the date on the decision or within 60 days of the Board's receipt of the Board Appeal, whichever is later. The Veteran was informed as such in a March 2025 VA correspondence, and has not provided good cause for an extension request. As such, the December 2023 Board Appeal requesting the Direct Review option is the Board Appeal that is currently before the Board. 

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for migraines is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for migraines is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2023 rating decision on appeal. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained a February 2023 medical opinion prior to the March 2023 rating decision on appeal. The February 2023 VA examiner opined migraines were not caused by service-connected tinnitus. However, the examiner did not provide an opinion on whether the Veteran's migraines had their onset in service or are aggravated by service-connected tinnitus. The Veteran asserted in the January 2023 claim that his migraines are directly incurred in service and/or secondary to service-connected tinnitus. 

As such, remand is warranted to correct this duty to assist error. On remand, he should be afforded a new examination that addresses whether the claimed migraines are associated with active service and/or aggravated by service-connected tinnitus.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for the claimed migraine disorder. The examiner must review the claims file. The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a) Is the disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service?

(b) Is the disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) aggravated, i.e., made worse, by service-connected tinnitus?

Provide a rationale to support the opinions.
