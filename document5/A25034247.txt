ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, is at least as likely as not related to his service, including his duties installing communications facilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from April 1987 to February 1988, December 2001 to August 2002, February 2003 to August 2003, October 2006 to March 2007, and March 2008 to Sept 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a January 2024 rating decision by a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran timely appealed the January 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 2023 rating decision.  In January 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2023 decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Based on the evidence, the claim has been expanded to a right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, is granted.

Preliminarily, the Board notes the Veteran is service connected for left foot plantar fasciitis with pes planus and metatarsalgia. See August 2023 rating decision (reasoning left foot injury and 2003 surgery were in service). With respect to the right foot, the AOJ made a favorable finding of a diagnosis of flatfoot (pes planus) with plantar fasciitis and metatarsalgia of the right foot, based on a September 2022 private Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) for Foot Conditions. See id. The Board shall not disturb the AOJ's favorable finding.

The Veteran contends that he sustained injury to both feet in 2003 during service in Iraq, from installing communications facilities, involving digging communications manholes and running heavy copper lines under aircraft runways. The Veteran contends he had to undergo surgery in 2013 for his right foot conditions.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

No foot trouble was noted upon entry to service. See 01/02/2008 STR - Medical, p.63 (02/01/1997 entrance examination). There is no evidence of complaints or treatment of the right foot in service. There are no medical records of the Veteran's right foot surgery in or around 2013. In a May 2016 rating decision, the AOJ conceded it did not obtain private treatment records from the right foot surgery because a fee was charged by the private facility and, thus, the Veteran was asked to provide those records. Beginning in 2020, treatment records show continuous VA and private treatment of right foot problems and pain, with MRI's reflecting various diagnoses including pes planus, plantar fasciitis, and metatarsalgia. See 06/14/2022 Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility, p. 63 (07/17/2020 MRI right foot), p. 59 (10/04/2021 MRI right ankle and foot), p. 33 (07/16/2020 x-ray right foot), p. 27 (08/04/2020 signs and symptoms of plantars fasciitis right foot and other diagnoses), p. 22 (10/12/2021 multiple chronic conditions of bilateral feet including tearing of plantar fascia, fraying of posterior tibial tendon, tearing of peroneal tendon and subtalar joint arthrosis), p. 14 (05/31/2022 treating podiatrist believes feet condition was due to Veteran's military duties); 06/01/2022 CAPRI, p. 333 (08/11/2020 citing 2014 right foot surgery plantars fasciitis release), p. 58 (01/10/2022 x-rays bilateral feet), p. 57 (02/14/2022 continuous foot pain).

In a June 2022 buddy statement, a fellow officer who served with the Veteran described their duties of digging deep holes for communications manholes under aircraft runways and running heavy copper cable without proper equipment. The fellow officer asserted that the Veteran's feet injuries, among other injuries, were related to his performance of these duties without proper equipment. 

In July 2022, the Veteran's long-term private treating podiatrist conducted an examination, which diagnosed plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, as well as a number of other right foot conditions, including trauma induced bilateral Charcot's, partial tearing of the plantar apogionsis, tendinosis, tenosynovitis of the peroneal tendons, posterior tibial tendinosis, tibiotalar and subtalar joint arthrosis. See July 2022 Foot Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire. The private examiner referenced an October 2021 MRI reflecting various diagnoses of severe chronic bilateral foot conditions. The Veteran reported onset of right foot trouble in active duty 15 years prior. The Veteran reported severe pain upon standing or walking. Right foot surgery (plantar fasciotomy) was reported to have taken place in 2013. The examiner noted the Veteran wore soft prefabricated ankle/foot orthosis and required bilateral custom braces.

The treating podiatrist provided a July 2022 private nexus opinion, which concluded that the Veteran's bilateral feet conditions were a direct result of and due to his service. The physician noted there were no other known risk factors that may have precipitated the Veteran's condition. See 07/18/2022 Medical Treatment Record Non-Government Facility.

A VA examination was not conducted. Based on the private examination, a July 2023 VA medical opinion found that the Veteran's claimed right foot condition was not at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred in or caused by his right foot injury during service. The examiner reasoned that the service treatment records do not endorse injury/dysfunction and or diagnosis of treatment of a right foot condition in service and the right foot surgery occurred outside of a service period. The examiner also opined that the right and left foot injuries were less likely than not due to toxic exposure risk activities and more likely associated with overuse/repetitive trauma.

Upon review of the evidence, the Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to his in-service right foot injuries incurred while carrying out his duties. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The private examination and private treatment records show the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right foot plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, as well as a number of other right foot conditions. Notably, the Veteran's diagnoses and claimed etiology for his right foot condition is the same as for his service-connected left foot condition. Thus, the question becomes whether the current right foot disability is also related to service. On this question there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes the July 2023 VA examiner's opinion. The Board finds this opinion to be conclusory, however, and without adequate medical analysis of the facts of the Veteran's specific case. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) (stating that a medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can weigh, and a mere conclusion by a medical doctor is insufficient to allow the Board to make an informed decision); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating "[t]he Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion"). The examiner's rationale of absence of service treatment records reflecting right foot problems does not obviate that his right foot disabilities after service may have been caused by, related to, or aggravated by his in-service injuries. Moreover, the examiner's opinion failed to address the Veteran's lay statements and fellow officer's buddy statement regarding the Veteran's foot injuries incurred in service. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding examination inadequate where the examiner did not comment on the appellant's report of in-service injury and instead relied on the absence of evidence in the STR's to provide a negative opinion). Further, no VA examination was conducted upon which the examiner relied in arriving at the negative nexus opinion. As such, the Board finds the VA examiner's opinion to be of limited probative value.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes the July 2022 private examination and positive nexus opinion from the Veteran's treating physician. The treating physician is a Board-certified podiatrist who has treated the Veteran's foot conditions for at least ten years, as reflected in the treatment records. The Board finds the treating physician's opinion both credible and highly probative due to his credentials and expertise in podiatry, as well his familiarity with the Veteran's medical history and circumstances of his service. See id. The private opinion was provided by the same physician who not only treated the Veteran's foot conditions over a number of years, but also conducted the private DBQ examination. In addition, the fellow officer's buddy statement describing the type of work the Veteran did during service that caused his foot injuries is further supportive of a positive nexus here.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current right foot condition is related to service. Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for a right foot condition, to include plantar fasciitis, pes planus, and metatarsalgia, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
