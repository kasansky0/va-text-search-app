ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 6, 2018 for the grant of service connection for eosinophilic esophagitis is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of June 6, 2018, and no earlier, for the 50 percent disability rating for eosinophilic esophagitis is granted.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for eosinophilic esophagitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed an initial claim seeking service connection for eosinophilic esophagitis on June 6, 2018; he has continuously pursued that claim.

2. From June 6, 2018, the Veteran's eosinophilic esophagitis manifested with symptoms productive of functional loss that more closely approximated severe esophageal stricture requiring liquids only, but not by marked impairment of general health, nor aspiration, undernutrition, and/or substantial weight loss, and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 6, 2018 for the grant of service connection for eosinophilic esophagitis is denied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 6, 2018, but no earlier, for the 50 percent eosinophilic esophagitis disability rating are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.400.

3. Since June 6, 2018, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for eosinophilic esophagitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 4.3, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2009 to June 2015 with additional service in the National Guard.

On June 6, 2018, the Veteran applied for service connection for Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE).  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the Veteran's claim in September 2018.  The Veteran appealed.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) granted service connection in July 2022.  In a July 2022 Rating Decision, the RO implemented the grant by assigning a 10 percent rating for EE from June 6, 2018 (date of claim) and a 50 percent rating from September 14, 2021 (date it was factually ascertainable there was an increase in the disability), under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7299-7203.  In April 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim to appeal both the effective date and his initial rating for EE. 

While the Veteran's April 2023 Supplemental claim was being processed by the RO, the RO proposed to reduce the Veteran's EE disability rating.  See May 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran requested a hearing.  See June 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.

In January 2024, the RO implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been received and readjudicated the issues of an earlier effective date and increased rating for EE as requested in the April 2023 supplemental claim.  In the January 2024 Rating Decision, the RO denied an earlier effective date and a rating higher than 10 percent prior to September 21, 2021 for EE.  The RO determined that September 21, 2021 was the earliest date that the evidence showed esophageal stricture permitting liquids only.  

The Veteran then submitted a simultaneous Higher-Level Review and Supplemental Claim in January 2024, essentially seeking an earlier effective date for the increase to 50 percent for his rating of EE disability.  See January 2024 Correspondence.  The RO adjudicated both.  The RO denied the HLR in a January 2024 Rating Decision.  The RO also implicitly found the new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the supplemental claim for EE earlier effective date in a separate January 2024 Rating Decision.  

In response to the proposal to reduce the Veteran's EE disability rating, the RO continued the EE rating as 50 percent disabling.  See February 2024 Rating Decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct review docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the respective decisions on the issues on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Veteran also contemporaneously submitted evidence with the appeal. The Board is mindful of the recent case of Edwards v. McDonough, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2023), where the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reminded the Board of its obligations "to read the documents that a claimant files in support of his [or her] appeal liberally and sympathetically" and "to consider the full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made." Id. at 62 (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). The backdrop for this reminder is 38 C.F.R. § 202(f).  That regulation requires the Board to contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent whenever the Board cannot identify which review option the claimant intends to select.  The Board can identify which review option the Veteran seeks due to the submission of duplicate Notice of Disagreements electing the Direct Review option and a follow-up email from the Veteran's Attorney to see whether the Board or RO were processing the Veteran's choice.  See also April 16, 2024 Board letter informing Veteran of his options to switch dockets.  In this decision, the Board grants, in full, the benefits sought by the Veteran on appeal, eliminating any prejudice to the Veteran in this determination.

There is evidence in the Veteran's claims file that arrived there after the decision on appeal, which means the Board may not consider it in deciding this appeal.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes a 2022 motion to advance a previous appeal on the Board's docket due to increased insurance costs.  If Veteran is suffering from a serious illness, is under severe financial hardship, or has other sufficient cause, he can request to have an appeal "Advanced on the Docket," or moved to the front of the line.  See April 16, 2024 letter.  If the Veteran is age 75 or older, his appeal will automatically be prioritized and he does not have to submit anything further.  To request advancement on the docket, the Veteran must submit a brief explanation of the reasons why the Board should prioritize his case.  He should also include documentation that supports his explanation.  For example, if he has severe financial hardship, examples of evidence he may submit to demonstrate severe financial hardship include, but are not limited to, evidence he is experiencing homelessness, a home foreclosure or eviction notice, or a financial status report (VA Form 5655).  The Board has not received sufficient supporting evidence showing severe financial hardship, so the current appeal has not been expedited pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c)(1).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2). 

Factual history

The Veteran stated that the date of onset of his severe esophageal symptoms was in September 2016.  See February 2021 Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination report.  The Veteran stated that his EE began with being diagnosed in 2016 by a physician in 2016.  Id.  He stated he had an EGD in 2016.  Id.  He stated he had biopsies of the esophagus and did blood work.  Id.  He stated he was then diagnosed with EE.  Id.  He stated he was sent to an allergy physician, but it was negative for any known allergies.  Id.  He stated he was sent back to the gastroenterologist and was prescribed oral Flovent, Omeprazole.  Id.  He stated he had esophageal dilatation on 3 separate occasions.  Id.  He stated the condition had worsened.  Id.  In a November 2017 Asthma, Allergy & Immunology Clinic, Dr. E stated that the Veteran had tried Omeprazole and swallowed Flovent and neither of these medications were helpful at all.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran took them both for about 6 months and the symptoms worsened despite the medication and he stopped them.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had not used oral steroids.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had two severe impactions in the past.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had not always been able to feel them immediately.  Id.  Dr. E stated that on one occasion he was okay for a while after eating, but then started to have food back up and he choked and threw up.  Id.  Dr. E. stated that the Veteran did not seek medical care on that occasion.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had to go to the ER just the once.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran apparently got a shot of glucagon and the food passed before it had to be removed.  Id.

In July 2018, the RO afforded the Veteran an Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination.  A July 2018 examiner diagnosed EE.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication (Flovent, Omeprazole) for the EE.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms were dysphagia and regurgitation.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the severity of the Veteran's esophageal disability was that it was amenable to dilation.    

In May 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran another Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination.  A May 2023 examiner diagnosed EE and stricture of the esophagus.  The Veteran stated that his disability began in 2015 when he first noticed choking on food, initially steak and then ultimately he was unable to swallow down pudding and then water.  The Veteran stated he was treated with esophageal dilation several times a year.  The May 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran had been trialed on multiple medications without success.  The Veteran reported he still had trouble passing and keeping food down in the esophagus.  The Veteran reported that food got stuck and he developed pain where the food got stuck.  The Veteran stated that he maintained a soft diet most days to prevent food from getting lodged in the esophagus.  He stated he had frequent dilations by GI.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication (Flovent, Omeprazole, elimination diet, allergy testing) without success.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of considerable impairment of health and included persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal and shoulder pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux, nausea, and vomiting.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the severity of the Veteran's esophageal disability was moderate as dilation provided temporary relief, but the frequency of symptoms crescendo until he ultimately had to switch to a soft diet and then scheduled for dilation.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the functional impact of the Veteran's EE and stricture of the esophagus was that the Veteran had frequent episodes of food getting stuck in esophagus which then caused him to regurgitate everything he consumed.  This caused pain and difficulty performing work functions.  He had to follow a soft diet when this occurred.  He had impaired sleep which caused impairment of concentration and extreme fatigue.  His work productivity suffered.  He had missed workdays due to dilations and follow up appointments related to this disability.  

In September 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran another Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination.  A September 2023 examiner diagnosed GERD and stricture of the esophagus.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran was diagnosed with EE during evaluation for dysphagia in 2016.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran was also found to have esophageal stricture and resultant GERD.  The Veteran stated that he had several esophageal dilations, about every six months, since the diagnosis.  The Veteran stated that he took Pantoprazole for GERD.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health, persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, and sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux.  The Veteran had four or more symptom recurrence per year and average duration of episodes of symptoms were 10 days or more.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had esophageal stricture characterized as severe and amenable to dilation.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had significant difficulty swallowing solids, requiring dilation intermittently.  The functional impact was that the Veteran stated he missed work one to two times a month due to pyrosis.  The September 2023 examiner also opined that the Veteran's GERD was due to his service-connected EE.  As a rationale, the September 2023 examiner recited the medical history summarized above.  The September 2023 examiner also opined that the Veteran's GERD was caused by toxic exposure since the Veteran was service connected for EE due to toxic exposure and was also found to have esophageal stricture and resultant GERD.   

As noted above, the RO proposed to reduce the Veteran's EE disability rating.  See May 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran requested a hearing.  In an October 2023 Hearing, the Veteran stated that he was primarily on a liquid diet.  He stated that he missed food.

Law

Effective date

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection shall be the later of the date of receipt of the application or the date that the entitlement to the benefit arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

On March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sep. 25, 2014).

Effective February 19, 2019, under VA's modernized appeals system, a claimant may seek review of an initial decision by filing a Supplemental Claim, request for Higher-Level Review, or Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  After a decision is issued in response to a request for Higher-Level Review, a claimant may seek further review by filing a Supplemental Claim or NOD.  After filing an NOD, a claimant may seek further review by filing a Supplemental Claim or timely appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Moreover, under VA's modernized appeals system, the effective date is fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options described above within one year of the decision, or with respect to an appeal to the CAVC, by filing an appeal that is accepted as timely by that court.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Increased rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations at any point during the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The assignment of a particular DC is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One DC may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. The Board may consider whether another rating code is "more appropriate" than the one used by the RO. See Tedeschi v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 411, 414 (1995). Any change in a DC must be specifically explained. Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992). 

Eosinophilic esophagitis

The VA amended the schedule of rating for digestive disorders, effective May 19, 2024.  The pre-amendment rating criteria apply only to claims filed before May 19, 2024.  For claims filed before May 19, 2024 (as is the case here), both the pre- and post-amendment rating criteria are applied based on whichever is more favorable to the claimant.  However, if the post-amendment criteria are more favorable to the claimant, the award based on the post-amendment criteria may not be made effective before May 19, 2024.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).

Pre-May 19, 2024 Amendment

Under DC 7203, a 30 percent rating is assigned for moderate stricture of the esophagus; a 50 percent rating is assigned for severe stricture of the esophagus, permitting liquids only; and an 80 percent rating is assigned where only liquids can pass through the esophagus, with marked impairment of general health.  

DC 7203 does not define the term "marked."  In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning.  Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015) (citing Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).  The ordinary meaning of "marked" is "having a distinctive or emphasized character."  Merriam-Webster Dictionary online, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked.  The Board defines the term "marked" in accordance with the above dictionary definition.  See Prokarym, 27 Vet. App. at 310.

Post-May 19, 2024 Amendment

Both DC 7206 and DC 7203 contain identical rating criteria with identical Notes. Note (3) to both DC 7206 and DC 7203 provide that they are applicable to the following non-exhaustive list of disabilities: esophagitis, mechanical or chemical; Mallory Weiss syndrome (bleeding at junction of esophagus and stomach due to tears) due to caustic ingestion of alkali or acid; drug-induced or infectious esophagitis due to Candida, virus, or other organism; idiopathic eosinophilic, or lymphocytic esophagitis; esophagitis due to radiation therapy; esophagitis due to peptic stricture; and any esophageal condition that requires treatment with sclerotherapy.

Pursuant to DC 7203, a noncompensable rating is warranted for a documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement.  A maximum 80 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of these symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a), and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).  38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a) defines substantial weight loss as "involuntary loss greater than 20% of an individual's baseline weight sustained for three months with diminished quality of self-care or work tasks."

DC 7203 contains several notes to assist in its application.  Note (1) provides that findings associated with the disability in question must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Note (2), directs VA to evaluate non-gastrointestinal complications of procedures of the disability at issue under the appropriate system at issue.

Notes (4) and (5) define recurrent and refractory esophageal strictures as contemplated by DC 7203.  Specifically, Note (4) defines recurrent esophageal stricture as "the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved."  Comparatively, Note (5) defines refractory esophageal stricture as "the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals."

"When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 6, 2018 for the grant of service connection for eosinophilic esophagitis

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 21, 2021 for the 50 percent rating for eosinophilic esophagitis

As noted above, the Veteran's EE has been assigned a 10 percent rating prior to September 21, 2021, and a 50 percent rating since that date, under DC 7203, which pertains to stricture of the esophagus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  The Veteran's Attorney asserts that the Veteran EE was diagnosed in 2015, worsened since that time, interferes with swallowing, work and requires ongoing dilation and emergency treatment.  See August 2023 VA Form 20-0996.  The Veteran's Attorney asserts that the Veteran qualifies for a 50 percent rating since 2018 due to the ongoing need for a liquid diet.  Id.  The Veteran's Attorney asserts that Medical Board proceedings, which began in 2018, showed discharge with a 50 percent rating.  For the following reasons, the Board finds that an effective date of June 6, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of the 50 percent rating for EE.

As noted above, on June 6, 2018, the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for EE.  See June 2018 VA Form 21-526b, Veteran's Supplemental Claim for Compensation.  As this claim was not filed within one year of separation from service, the applicable date of claim is June 6, 2018.  As noted above, the Veteran continuously pursued his claim through grant of service connection and appeal of the effective date in the AMA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Thus, the Board finds that the date of claim is June 6, 2018.  The remaining question for the Board review is when the Veteran's entitlement to a 50 percent rating for EE manifested.

The Veteran consistently stated that his EE had worsened in 2016, and that he could only consume soft foods.  He credibly testified in October 2023 that he was on a liquid diet and that he missed food.  The Board finds the Veteran credible.  The July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P examiners indicated a lower level of impairment.  Accordingly, the evidence for and against functional loss equivalent to severe stricture permitting liquids only is in approximate balance.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds that the Veteran experienced functional loss approximating severe stricture from at least June 6, 2018 (date of claim).  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

The Veteran is not seeking, and the law prohibits the award of, an even earlier effective date of service connection, as June 6, 2018 is the first claim for EE and there was no Intent to File from which to award an earlier effective date.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran date of claim of June 6, 2018 is the earlier effective date the law allows.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 50 percent for eosinophilic esophagitis

The Veteran also asserts a rating in excess of 50 percent is warranted for his EE based on Army Regulation 40-501, Chapter 3-16 a (Esophagus), the criteria it used to disqualify him from service.  It states: ... (2) Eosinophilic esophagus, with frequent recurrent dysphagia or foreign body obstruction after adequate trial of medical therapy or if treatment requires swallowed steroids; ... (4) stricture of the esophagus of such a degree as to restrict diet to liquids, require repeated dilation (more than two), and hospitalization, or cause difficulty maintaining weight and nutrition.  See April 2023 statement.

The Board finds that the criteria for an initial rating higher than 50 percent for EE have not been met.  The Board will analyze whether a rating greater than 50 percent is warranted under the pre-May 19, 2024 amended rating criteria and then will analyze whether a rating greater than 50 percent is warranted under the May 19, 2024 amended criteria.

Pre-May 19, 2024

Prior to May 19, 2024, the Board finds the criteria for a rating higher than 50 percent have not been met, as the record shows that his EE has not caused impairment of general health that is distinctive or emphasized, i.e., "marked."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7203.  As noted above, the Board finds persuasive that the July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P examiners all found at worst moderate symptoms amenable to dilation and not requiring liquids only.  Although the Board has granted the Veteran the benefit of the doubt in granting an earlier effective date based on functional loss equivalent to severe stricture allowing liquids only, the evidence persuasively weighs against functional loss showing impairment of general health that is distinctive or emphasized.  

The Board has also considered whether the ameliorative effects of medication have resulted in the display of a less distinctive or emphasized disease manifestation.  However, the Board finds persuasive the July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P examiners' conclusions that medications were ineffective.  In other words, the severity of the Veteran's EE was what was documented on the July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P exams.  

The Board has also considered whether the September 2023 C&P examiner's findings amount to definite impairment of health sufficient to award a 60 percent rating under DC 7305, or marked impairment of health sufficient to award an 80 percent rating under DC 7203.  The Board finds it does not.  The September 2023 examiner determined that the Veteran had symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.  Considerable impairment of health in other DCs like DC 7346 amounts to a 30 percent disability rating.  In addition, the Board finds that DC 7305 and other DCs are not more appropriate than the one used by the RO to rate the Veteran's EE because DC 7305 is used for rating duodenal ulcer and contemplates anemia and weight loss, which is not as appropriate as DC 7203, which rates stricture of the esophagus.  In addition, the Board finds that application of the regular schedular standards is adequate to rate this single service-connected disability and that the disability is not so exceptional or unusual as to render the schedular standards impractical.  Thus, extra-schedular consideration is also not warranted in this case.  38 C.F.R. 3.321(b)(1).       

The Board has also considered whether the application of DC 7346 would result in a higher rating for the Veteran's EE.  The Board finds that it does not.  The only rating higher than 30 percent under DC 7346 is a 60 percent rating, which is assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  The Veteran's EE has not been manifested by material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia.  Further, as discussed above, it has not been manifested by symptoms causing marked impairment of general health.  Accordingly, application of DC 7346 is not more favorable to the Veteran.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran's EE has not caused impairment of general health that is distinctive or emphasized, i.e., "marked," nor manifested by material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.

Based on the evidence in the review period, the Board notes that a maximum 80 percent rating is also not warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture causing dysphagia because there is insufficient evidence to show aspiration, undernutrition, and/or substantial weight loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a), and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture or PEG tube.

In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran's EE is characterized by esophageal stricture with dysphagia and treated by dilation.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.
