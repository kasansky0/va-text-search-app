FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's major depressive disorder was at first manifested by symptoms contemplated by the 30 percent rating criteria prior to January 31, 2020.

2. The Veteran's major depressive disorder was at most manifested by symptoms contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria from January 31, 2020. 

3. The Veteran's non-hodgkin's lymphoma is no longer active, was last treated on June 27, 2019, and is not considered to be indolent and non-contiguous phase of low grade non-hodgkin's lymphoma. 

4. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in approximate balance that the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves was manifest by symptoms that constitute severe incomplete paralysis as of May 12, 2021.

5. The persuasive weight of the evidence is in approximate balance that the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves was manifest by symptoms that constitute severe incomplete paralysis as of May 12, 2021.

6. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is manifest by symptoms that constitute moderate incomplete paralysis. 

7. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is manifest by symptoms that constitute moderate incomplete paralysis.

8. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is manifest by symptoms that constitute severe to complete paralysis. 

9. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is manifest by symptoms that constitute severe to complete paralysis.

10. The agency of original jurisdiction denied a claim of service connection for depression in a June 2013 rating decision; the Veteran did not timely file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence, and thus this decision became final.

11. The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on May 30, 2019.

12. In June 2019 written correspondence, the agency of original jurisdiction informed the Veteran he needed to file a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim in order to reopen his claim of service connection for depression. The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim on March 26, 2020.

13. The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for non-hodgkin's lymphoma on May 30, 2019. 

14. The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy on May 30, 2019. 

15. Evidence of peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural and external cutaneous nerves was first shown in an April 29, 2021, private examination. 

16. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, no effective function of the bilateral feet remain other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from September 1968 to January 1973. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the issues of assignment of effective dates for a 20 percent rating for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves, as well as the claims for entitlement to SMC at the (l) rate based on a regular need for aid and attendance and at the (r)(2) rate based on a need for higher-level aid and attendance, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Board should consider only those factors contained in the rating criteria. Massey v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 204 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board will also consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Nevertheless, where the evidence contains factual findings that show a change in the severity of symptoms during the course of the rating period on appeal, assignment of staged ratings would be permissible. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to January 31, 2020, for major depressive disorder is denied.

2. Entitlement to a rating of 70 percent, but no higher, from January 31, 2020, for major depressive disorder is granted.

The Veteran contends that his major depressive disorder (MDD) is manifest by symptoms that warrant a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to August 4, 2021, and in excess of 70 percent thereafter.

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent or higher.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent or higher prior to January 31, 2020. At that time, the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 30 percent rating. The Board also finds that the Veteran's symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent after January 31, 2020, but instead were more closely approximated by the symptoms and level of impairment associated with a 70 percent rating.

A noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication, or to interfere with occupational and social functioning.

A 10 percent rating is assigned when mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of occasional stress, or symptoms controlled by medication cause occupational and social impairment.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2020, at which time the examiner found the Veteran's MDD resulted in occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. The Veteran reported staying in contact with his children, sister, and ex-brother-in-law, going to physical therapy, working out at his home, watching television, having hired help around the house, and using a meal delivery service due to difficulty walking. The Veteran was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma in 2019 and underwent chemotherapy treatment, and he began individual counseling in January 2020. The Veteran also reported having difficulty staying asleep due to anxiety dreams and a fear of dying, feeling down and numb, having no sense of joy or excitement, and having recurrent worries about a cancer relapse, as well as panic attacks that are associated with his thoughts about his deteriorating health. The examiner found the Veteran had symptoms of depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and disturbances of motivation and mood. 

In October 2021, the Veteran submitted an August 2021 private psychiatric examination conducted by A.M.H., a clinical psychologist.  A.M.H. noted diagnoses of both MDD and posttraumatic stress disorder that had overlapping symptoms which could not be differentiated. A.M.H. found the Veteran's MDD resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood. They also found the Veteran had the following symptoms: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks weekly or less, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, flattened affect, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty establishing and maintaining relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, suicidal ideation, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living. A.M.H. explained that the Veteran likely exhibited these symptoms from at least January 31, 2020, when he began attending individual counseling sessions.

In December 2024 written argument addressing the Veteran's need for aid and attendance, his representative argued that he required supervision due to safety concerns related to memory issues caused by his MDD.

The October 2020 VA examination shows that the Veteran's MDD was manifested by the following symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating: depressed mood, anxiety, and chronic sleep impairment. The examination also showed the Veteran suffered from disturbances of motivation and mood, which is associated with a 50 percent rating. The Veteran also reported experiencing recurrent panic attacks associated with thoughts related to his declining health, although it is unclear how often these panic attacks occurred, and thus it is unclear whether they are better approximated by the 30 percent, 50 percent, or 70 percent rating criteria. 

The August 2021 private examination shows that the Veteran's MDD was manifested by the following symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating: suicidal ideation and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances.  The examination also showed the Veteran's MDD resulted in an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, which is associated with a 100 percent rating. Additionally, A.M.H. found that these symptoms were likely present from at least January 31, 2020, when the Veteran first began attending individual counseling. Furthermore, the Veteran's representative's argument that the Veteran required supervision due to his memory issues causing safety concerns is similar to a persistent danger of hurting oneself, which is contemplated by the 100 percent rating criteria.

The Board finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 30 percent rating prior to January 31, 2020.  The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, but was generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation, as shown by the October 2020 VA examination. The Board also finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 70 percent rating as of January 31, 2020.  The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity with deficiencies in most areas, as found by the August 2021 private opinion. While the Board notes that the October 2020 VA examiner found the Veteran's symptoms were best approximated by the 30 percent rating criteria up until that examination, the April 2021 private opinion that the Veteran likely met the 70 percent rating criteria at the time he started his individual counseling in January 2020 is of approximately equal probative value. 

Thus, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that a 70 percent rating is warranted from January 31, 2020.

While the Veteran did experience disturbances in motivation and mood, which is contemplated by a 50 percent rating, the evidence overall does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a 50 percent rating or higher prior to January 31, 2020.  As noted above, the Veteran's other remaining symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a 30 percent rating.  Additionally, the Board also notes the Veteran experienced an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living per the August 2021 private opinion.  However, the overall evidence does not support finding the Veteran's MDD rises to the level of disability contemplated by the 100 percent rating criteria, and the combination of his other symptoms is most closely approximated by a 70 percent rating, as discussed above. Furthermore, the Board acknowledges the representative's argument that the Veteran's memory loss requires him to be supervised due to safety concerns. However, the overall evidence of the record does not support that the Veteran's MDD, alone, is the reason why he requires supervision for his safety. Thus, the Board finds that a 100 percent rating is not warranted.

In short, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms warranted a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to January 31, 2020. Thus, a rating in excess of 30 percent prior to that date is not warranted.

However, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in approximate balance that the Veteran's MDD met the criteria for a 70 percent rating as of January 31, 2020. As such, a rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for MDD is warranted as of January 31, 2020.

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma from July 1, 2023, is denied.

The Veteran contends that the reduction of his 100 percent rating to a 0 percent rating for service-connected non-hodgkin's lymphoma was improper.

Initially, the Board notes that the claim at issue is not a formal reduction under the substantive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 because the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7715 contain a temporal element for continuance of a 100 percent rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma residuals. Therefore, the AOJ's action was not a "rating reduction" as that term is commonly understood. See Rossiello v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 430, 432-33 (1992) (finding that a 100 percent rating for mesothelioma ceased to exist by operation of law because the applicable Diagnostic Code [6819] involved contained a temporal element for that 100 percent rating). In short, in this case, the Board must only determine if the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) were met and if the reduction was warranted by operation of law under DC 7715.

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) set forth procedural guidelines for reducing a disability rating. Procedurally, where reduction in the evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction of current compensation payments, a rating decision proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons supporting the proposed reduction. The Veteran must then be given 60 days to submit additional evidence and to request a predetermination hearing. Then, a rating action will be taken to effectuate the reduction, if warranted. The effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the Veteran of the final action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).

Here, a letter shortly following the November 2022 rating decision proposing to reduce the rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma provided the Veteran with notice of the proposed reduction and informed him that he could submit medical or other evidence to show why the reduction should not be made. The letter explained that the evidence could include a statement from a physician who treated or examined the Veteran, and the AOJ also notified the Veteran that he could request a personal hearing to provide testimony on this matter. The AOJ informed the Veteran that if he did not request a hearing within 30 days or submit additional evidence within 60 days, the AOJ would make a decision based on the evidence of record. Thus, the letter provided adequate notice for the proposed reduction. Additionally, when the reduction was effectuated in an April 2023 rating decision, it was not effective until July 1, 2023. As such, the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) were met in this case.

For the reasons below, the Board finds that there is no evidentiary basis for continuance of the 100 percent rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma under DC 7715 from July 1, 2023.

Under DC 7715, non-hodgkin's lymphoma is rated at 100 percent when there is active disease, during treatment phase, or with indolent and non-contiguous phase of low grade non-hodgkin's lymphoma. The note to DC 7715 provides that a 100 percent evaluation shall continue beyond the cessation of any surgical therapy, radiation therapy, antineoplastic chemotherapy, or other therapeutic procedures. Two years after discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating shall be determined by mandatory VA examination. Any reduction in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination shall be subject to the provisions of § 3.105(e) of this chapter. If there has been no recurrence, rate on residuals under the appropriate diagnostic code(s). 38 C.F>R. § 4.117, Diagnostic Code 7715.

In a September 2019 VA examination, the examiner found the Veteran was diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma in March 2019, and the condition was considered active and in the treatment phase. They noted the treatment was completed in June 2019.

In an October 2022 VA examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's treatment ended in 2019. The Veteran reported experiencing worsened bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy as a result of his treatment. The Veteran's non-hodgkin's lymphoma was found to be in remission, with his last treatment having been in June 2019. The Veteran was now only seen for monitoring. 

The Veteran submitted private medical opinions from Dr. M.T.P. which noted that the Veteran completed treatment for his non-hodgkin's lymphoma in June 2019 that achieved a complete response. However, this treatment aggravated the Veteran's previously diagnosed peripheral neuropathy beyond its natural progression that resulted a complete loss of mobility without a wheelchair.

Review of the evidence of record shows the Veteran's non-hodgkin's lymphoma was last treated in June 2019 and has since gone into remission. This is supported both by the October 2022 VA examination and the November 2022 private opinion by Dr. M.T.P., who was his treating physician. There is nothing in the record showing a recurrence of non-hodgkin's lymphoma after the cessation of treatment in June 2019, nor has there been any further treatment after that date. As for the Veteran's reported residuals of bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, separate ratings have been awarded and the ratings for these conditions are discussed later in this decision.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence does not support a restoration of a 100 percent rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma. Additionally, the evidence of record is against finding the Veteran has met the 100 percent rating criteria at any point after July 1, 2023, the date of the reduction. Therefore, a compensable rating for non-hodgkin's lymphoma is not warranted.

4. Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves from May 12, 2021, is granted.

5. Entitlement to a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves from May 12, 2021, is granted.

6. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is denied.

7. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is denied.

8. Entitlement to a compensable rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is denied.

9. Entitlement to a compensable rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is denied.

The Veteran is seeking higher ratings for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves, which are all rated under DC 8521. He is also seeking a higher rating for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural nerves, rated under DC 8526, and the bilateral external cutaneous nerves, rated under DC 8529.

Under DCs 8521 and 8526, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent disabling. Additionally, a 40 percent rating is warranted under DC 8521 for complete paralysis with foot drop and slight droop of first phalanges of all toes, cannot dorsiflex the foot, extension (dorsal flexion) of proximal phalanges of toes lost; abduction of foot lost, adduction weakened; anesthesia covers entire dorsum of foot and toes.  As for DC 8526, complete paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles is rated at 40 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

Paralysis of the external cutaneous nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8529.  Under these criteria, mild to moderate paralysis is rated as noncompensable.  Severe to complete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

The Board acknowledges that terms such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the regulations, nor are specific symptoms associated with those terms. Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018). However, one possible source of definitions is the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (hereinafter, the "Manual").

While the Manual is not binding on the Board, there are provisions of the Manual that address the terms. See DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Specifically, the Manual discusses the terminology in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8510 - 8730. See VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.c (Nov. 16, 2017). The Manual must be addressed by the Board where relevant. See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021).

In cases where a peripheral nerve disability is only manifested by sensory impairment, the Manual provides:

To make a choice between mild and moderate, consider the evidence of record and the following guidelines: The mild level of evaluation would be more reasonably assigned when sensory symptoms are recurrent but not continuous, assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or affecting a smaller area in the nerve distribution. Reserve the moderate level of evaluation for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement. These are cases where the sensory symptoms are continuous, assigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment, and/or affecting a larger area in the nerve distribution. VA Adjudication Procedures Manual, M21-1, III.iv.4.N.4.b (Feb. 2, 2018).

Moreover, according to the Manual, "moderately severe" incomplete paralysis is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123. Thus, the term would be appropriate for "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy, see the criteria for a severe evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520." M-21, III.iv.4.N.4.c.

The Manual further provides that, for "severe" incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve, marked muscle atrophy is expected. In general, severe incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve involves motor and/or reflex impairment "(for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability." Id. "Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve." Id.

VA regulation provides that the term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017). 

In the September 2019 VA examination, the Veteran reported having constant numbness and tingling in his feet for the previous year, as well as occasional shooting pain in his feet. The examiner found the Veteran had mild intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias/dysesthesias, and severe numbness in his bilateral lower extremities. The examiner also noted the Veteran had a loss of balance related to his peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran had normal muscle strength and reflexes, but he had decreased sensation in his bilateral lower legs and ankles, as well as his feet and toes. No trophic changes were noted. The Veteran's gait was abnormal due to him walking slowly, and he used a cane for ambulation. The Veteran reported regularly using a cane and a shower chair. However, the examiner found all of the Veteran's lower extremity nerves were normal with respect to severity evaluation, and his peripheral neuropathy did not impact his ability to work. 

In the November 2020 Va examination, the Veteran reported having numbness in his feet and toes that went up to his ankles, weakness in his legs, and imbalance issues. The examiner noted the Veteran had mild intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias/dysesthesias, and numbness bilaterally. His muscle strength was noted as 4/5 bilaterally for knee extension, as well as plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of his ankles. The Veteran also had decreased reflexes in his ankles and decreased sensation in his lower legs and ankles, as well as feet and toes. The examiner noted the Veteran had trophic changes of shiny skin with hair loss. The Veteran had a weakened gait that was slow and unsteady, and he used a cane for ambulation. The examiner concluded the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis in his bilateral sciatic nerves. The Veteran also constantly used a cane. Because of the weakness in his legs, which resulted in a very slow and unsteady/cautious gait, the Veteran was unable to function in an occupational environment. 

In an April 2021 private examination by Dr. A.R., the Veteran was found to have moderate constant and intermittent pain, as well as severe paresthesias/dysesthesias and numbness. Dr. A.R. found the Veteran's muscle strength was 4/5 for his bilateral knees and ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. He also had no reflexes in his ankles, and he had decreased sensation in his bilateral thighs and lower legs/ankles, and sensation was absent in his feet/toes. The Veteran also had trophic changes of shiny skin and hair loss. The Veteran was noted as having issues with balance, ambulating slowly and unsteadily with the use of a cane. Dr. A.R. found the Veteran's bilateral external popliteal, musculocutaneous, anterior tibial, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and external cutaneus nerves all had moderate incomplete paralysis. His anterior crural and internal saphenous nerves had mild incomplete paralysis. The Veteran used a walker regularly, and the use of a cane was noted previously in the examination. The examiner noted the Veteran had EMG testing in April 2021. Additionally, Dr. A.R. concluded the Veteran's difficulty with ambulation and balance made it so that he was unable to perform prolonged walking and standing, and he was unable to function in an occupational setting.

A May 2021 VA treatment note shows the Veteran faxed private treatment records with EMG results that showed moderate to severe sensomotor peripheral neuropathy in his bilateral lowr extremities. A separate May 2021 VA treatment note shows the Veteran requested a wheelchair for home use and was fitted with a wheelchair in June 2021. An August 2021 VA treatment note states that the Veteran had severe neuropathy in his feet. During the October 2022 VA examination for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the Veteran was noted as being in a wheelchair due to being unable to walk as a result of his bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, a November 2022 opinion by Dr. M.T.P. explained that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy had resulted in a complete loss of mobility without a wheelchair. 

As noted by the November 2020 and April 2021 examinations, the Veteran trophic changes of shiny skin and hair loss on both legs. Both examinations also noted the Veteran strength was 4/5 for his bilateral knees and plantar flexion and dorsiflexion of the ankles. The November 2020 examination showed decreased reflexes in the ankles, while the April 2021 examination showed absent ankle reflexes. Both examinations showed decreased sensation in the lower legs and ankles, while the April 2021 examination also showed decreased sensation in the thighs and no sensation in the feet. As for pain, the September 2019 and November 2020 examinations found the Veteran had mild intermittent pain, while the April 2021 examination showed moderate constant and intermittent pain. None of the examinations showed muscle atrophy or symptoms associated with complete paralysis.

Additionally, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy progressed to the point where the Veteran is now wheelchair bound, and has been wheelchair bound since at least October 2022, and a November 2022 private opinion from Dr. M.T.P. confirms that this was the result of the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability is primarily manifest by impairment of motor functions, trophic changes, sensory disturbance, loss of reflexes, and pain as of the October 2020 examination.  Additionally, the Board finds that the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy resulted in him requiring the use of a wheelchair for mobility, as shown by the May 2021 VA treatment note where the Veteran requested to be fitted for a wheelchair due to extreme difficulty with ambulation. The Veteran was later noted as being wheelchair bound as a result of his lower extremity peripheral neuropathy per the November 2022 private opinion from Dr. M.T.P. The Board further finds that the most probative evidence of record is against finding the Veteran had any symptoms associated with complete paralysis of any of his nerves.

Regarding the bilateral anterior crural nerves, Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis, which is rated at 10 percent under DC 8526. Additionally, regarding the bilateral external cutaneous nerves of the thighs, the Board finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis, which is noncompensable under DC 8529. While the August 2021 VA treating physician noted severe neuropathy in the Veteran's feet, the anterior crural nerves and external cutaneous nerves impact feeling in the thigh and, at most, lower leg, but not the feet. Thus, the note regarding severe neuropathy in the feet is not associated with these nerves. Accordingly, a rating in excess of 10 percent for the bilateral anterior crural nerves and in excess of 0 percent for the bilateral external cutaneous nerves is not warranted. 

At this time, the Board notes that, in its August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted a rating of 20 percent for the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves. However, the AOJ failed to award an effective date for this increase. In this instance, the Board finds that the AOJ should determine the effective date of a 20 percent rating in the first instance. Further discussion of this matter will be in the "Reasons for Remand" section of this decision.

However, the Board also finds that a rating of 30 percent is warranted for the Veteran's bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves. While these nerves were noted as having, at most, moderate incomplete paralysis, an August 2021 VA treatment note found that the Veteran had severe neuropathy of the feet. All of the above nerves except for the musculocutaneous nerves go into the feet. Additionally, the Veteran also requested to be issued a wheelchair in May 2021 due to having difficulty using his walker, and he was fitted with a wheelchair in June 2021. A November 2022 private opinion from Dr. M.T.P. found the Veteran was wheelchair bound due to the severity of his peripheral neuropathy. Thus, after finding all benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves level of impairment is most analogous to severe incomplete paralysis. Thus, a 30 percent rating is warranted under DC 8521 as of May 12, 2021, the date which the Veteran requested a wheelchair. These nerves do not, however, meet the criteria for complete paralysis, even with the Veteran being in a wheelchair. Under DC 8521, complete paralysis requires evidence of foot drop and a slight droop of the first phalanges of all toes, no dorsiflexion of the foot, lost extension of the proximal phalanges of the toes, lost abduction of the foot, weakened adduction, and anesthesia covering the entire dorsum of the foot and toes. The evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has been found to have any of these symptoms, and thus a 40 percent rating is not warranted.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for the bilateral external cutaneous nerves and a rating in excess of 10 percent for the bilateral anterior crural nerves. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

However, the Board also finds that the evidence of record is in approximate balance that the Veteran's bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves, all of which are rated together under DC 8521, meet the criteria for a 30 percent rating as of May 12, 2021. Thus, a rating of 30 percent for the Veteran's bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is warranted as of May 12, 2021.

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. When an award is based on a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the new (i.e., reopened) claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless new and material evidence or new and relevant evidence was received within the relevant appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q).

If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought, within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). The Board notes that the preamble to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 explicitly excludes the intent-to-file framework from supplemental claims. However, in the case of Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that this exclusion was invalid. Therefore, as a result of this July 2021 decision, the intent-to-file framework of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 does apply to supplemental claims. Further, only one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file. If multiple claims are filed within one year of notice of an intent to file, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(ii).

In deciding this case based on its application of the law to the pertinent facts, the Board notes that the "date of receipt" of claim means the date on which the claim was received by VA, except as to specific provisions for claims received in the State Department, the Social Security Administration, or the Department of Defense. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (r)

10. Entitlement to an effective date of May 30, 2019, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder is granted.

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to March 26, 2020, for service connection for MDD is warranted.

The AOJ originally denied service connection for MDD in a May 2013 rating decision. The Veteran did not submit any new and material evidence or a notice of disagreement within one year of the decision, and it became final.

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on May 30, 2019, and he included a claim for service connection for depression. In June 2019 written correspondence, the AOJ informed the Veteran that, in order to reopen his claim for service connection for depression, he needed to file a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim on March 26, 2020, which the AOJ accepted and used as the basis for the current effective date for service connection for MDD. 

As noted above, if VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought, within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). Additionally, in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021), this was found to apply to the filing of supplemental claims. Here, while the Veteran did not explicitly file a VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC, the Veteran's filing of the May 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ clearly shows his intent to file a claim for service connection for MDD. Furthermore, after being informed that he filed the wrong form, the Veteran correctly filed a supplemental claim in March 2020, within one year of the VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the correct effective date for service connection for MDD is May 30, 2019, the date which the Veteran filed the VA Form 21-526EZ that will be construed as an intent to file with respect to this claim. Accordingly, an effective date of May 30, 2019, for service connection for MDD is granted.

11. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for non-hodgkin's lymphoma is denied.

12. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is denied.

13. Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is denied.

14. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is denied.

15. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior crural nerve is denied.

16. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is denied.

17. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the external cutaneous nerve of the thigh is denied.

The Veteran contends that an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for service connection for non-hodgkin's lymphoma and bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is warranted. He also contends that an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural and external cutaneous nerves is warranted.

The Veteran first filed his claims for service connection for non-hodgkin's lymphoma in a May 30, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ. While the Veteran was first diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma in March 2019, because the effective date of a claim is the later of either the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, the effective date must be May 30, 2019, the date the Veteran filed his claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Thus, an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for non-hodgkin's lymphoma is not warranted.

Additionally, the Veteran also filed a claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy in the May 30, 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ. The AOJ first granted service connection for peripheral neuropathy in a November 2020 rating decision, and it rated the condition under DC 8520, which is associated with sciatica. The AOJ then granted additional ratings for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural nerves and external cutaneous nerves in an October 2021 rating decision that was effective as of April 29, 2021, the date of the private examination showing these nerves were affected. The code sheet associated with this rating decision shows that the Veteran was still separately connected for bilateral peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve branches under DC 8521. In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ recharacterized the Veteran's rating for bilateral sciatic nerve branches to be a rating for the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves, updating the rating to reflect the nerves listed in the April 2021 private examination. The effective date for these nerves, still rated under 8521, was May 30, 2019, the date originally awarded to the rating for the bilateral sciatic nerve branches.

The Board finds that the appropriate effective date for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is May 30, 2019, the date the Veteran filed his VA Form 21-526EZ. While the AOJ had changed the description of which nerves were affected from the sciatic nerve to the sciatic nerve branch to all of the aforementioned nerves, it is clear that the same condition was continuously rated. Because service connection cannot be granted prior to the date the Veteran first filed his claim, May 30, 2019, is the earliest date available. Therefore, an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, for service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is not warranted.

As for the bilateral anterior crural and external cutaneous nerves, April 29, 2021, is the correct effective date. The first evidence of these nerves being affected by peripheral neuropathy is the April 29, 2021, private examination. As previously noted, the effective date of a claim is the later of either the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Here, while a claim for general peripheral neuropathy was filed on May 30, 2019, these nerves were not shown to be impacted until the April 29, 2021, private examination. Additionally, while the Veteran was service connected for bilateral sciatica as of May 30, 2019, this effective date cannot be applied to the anterior crural or external cutaneous nerves because they are separate and distinct from each other without any overlap. This is different from the Veteran's separate rating for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves, which are considered part of the sciatic nerve branch and thus can be used interchangeably with the previous rating for the sciatic nerve. As such, seeing as the earliest evidence of peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural and external cutaneous nerves was the April 29, 2021, examination, this is the correct effective date for service connection, and an earlier effective date is not warranted.

Accordingly, for the reasons above, the Board finds that an effective date prior to May 30, 2019, is not warranted for service connection for non-hodgkin's lymphoma or for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves. Additionally, an effective date prior to April 29, 2021, for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior crural and external cutaneous nerves is not warranted. 

18. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) based on the loss of use of both feet is granted.

SMC is an additional level of compensation available to veterans, above the basic levels of compensation, for various types of losses or levels of impairment due solely to service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114; see Breniser v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 64 (2011).

As relevant to the Veteran's claim, SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) is payable when a Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or is permanently bedridden or with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

The Board notes that the Veteran was previously granted SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) because he met the requirements for statutory housebound; however, he no longer meets these requirements. Additionally, the Veteran has filed a claim for SMC (l) based on the need for aid an attendance, as well as SMC (r)(2) based on the need for a higher level of aid and attendance. These claims will be addressed later in the "Remand" section of this decision. The Board further notes that the Veteran has not explicitly raised the claim for entitlement to SMC (l) based on loss of use of both feet; however, the Board finds this claim has been raised by the record in conjunction with the Veteran's claims for increased ratings for his bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, and thus will address this claim below.

The relevant inquiry concerning an SMC award for the loss of use of both feet is whether no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well served by an amputation stump with use of a suitable prosthetic appliance. See Tucker v. West, 11 Vet. App. 369, 371-72 (1998). The determination will be made on the basis of the actual remaining function, whether the acts of balancing, propulsion, etc., could be accomplished equally well by an amputation stump with prosthesis. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (a)(2), 4.63.

Additional guidance for determining functional loss is provided under 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, which states in relevant part that functional loss may be due to defective innervation or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. See Tucker, 11 Vet. App. at 371-72. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. A little used part of the musculoskeletal system may be expected to show evidence of disuse, either through atrophy, the condition of the skin, absence of normal callosity or the like.

In an April 2021 private examination by Dr. A.R., the Veteran was found to have moderate constant and intermittent pain, as well as severe paresthesias/dysesthesias and numbness. Dr. A.R. found the Veteran's muscle strength was 4/5 for his bilateral knees and ankle plantar flexion and dorsiflexion. He also had no reflexes in his ankles, and he had decreased sensation in his bilateral thighs and lower legs/ankles, and sensation was absent in his feet/toes. The Veteran also had trophic changes of shiny skin and hair loss. The Veteran was noted as having issues with balance, ambulating slowly and unsteadily with the use of a cane. Dr. A.R. found the Veteran's bilateral external popliteal, musculocutaneous, anterior tibial, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and external cutaneus nerves all had moderate incomplete paralysis. His anterior crural and internal saphenous nerves had mild incomplete paralysis. The Veteran used a walker regularly, and the use of a cane was noted previously in the examination. The examiner noted the Veteran had EMG testing in April 2021. Additionally, Dr. A.R. concluded the Veteran's difficulty with ambulation and balance made it so that he was unable to perform prolonged walking and standing, and he was unable to function in an occupational setting.

A May 2021 VA treatment note shows the Veteran faxed private treatment records with EMG results that showed moderate to severe sensomotor peripheral neuropathy in his bilateral lowr extremities. A separate May 2021 VA treatment note shows the Veteran requested a wheelchair for home use and was fitted with a wheelchair in June 2021. An August 2021 VA treatment note states that the Veteran had severe neuropathy in his feet. During the October 2022 VA examination for non-hodgkin's lymphoma, the Veteran was noted as being in a wheelchair due to being unable to walk as a result of his bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, a November 2022 opinion by Dr. M.T.P. explained that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy had resulted in a complete loss of mobility without a wheelchair. However, nowhere in the record is it noted that the severity of the Veteran's functional impairment of both lower extremities would be equally well served by amputation with the use of a suitable prosthetic device. 

While the April 2021 private examination did not find that the Veteran's bilateral lower leg functioning was so diminished that amputation with prosthesis would equally serve the Veteran, the Board points out that this examination was conducted prior to the Veteran requiring a wheelchair as a result of his peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, the November 2022 private opinion by Dr. M.T.P. found the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy had progressed to the point where the Veteran had a complete loss of mobility without a wheelchair. A May 2023 VA treatment note shows the Veteran reported having numbness in his legs that resulted in him being unable to feel things such as the accelerator and brake of a car, while a June 2023 VA treatment note reiterates that the Veteran was unable to walk. VA and private treatment records also show the Veteran had a history of an unsteady gait and balance issues and required the use of a cane and a walker prior to him becoming wheelchair bound. 

After taking into consideration the totality of the evidence, and after finding all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that his bilateral peripheral neuropathy has progressed to the point where the Veteran has effectively lost the use of both of his feet, as contemplated by 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l). Thus, based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the criteria for an SMC award at the (l) rate on the basis of loss of use of both feet due to service-connected bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy have been met.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Assignment of an effective date for a 20 percent rating for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is remanded.

2. Assignment of an effective date for a 20 percent rating for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves is remanded.

As noted earlier in this decision, the AOJ granted ratings of 20 percent for the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves in an August 2024 rating decision. However, the AOJ failed to assign an effective date for this increase in its rating decision. The AOJ also failed to effectuate this increase, and thus there is no evidence in the record that the Board could use to otherwise determine an effective date. Because the AOJ granted a 20 percent rating in its August 2024 rating decision, the Board finds that it would be most appropriate for the AOJ to determine the effective date of this grant in the first instance. 

Therefore, the Board finds that remand is necessary in order for the AOJ to determine the effective date for the 20 percent rating for peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) ("The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."). 

3. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) based on the Veteran's need for regular aid and attendance of another is remanded.

4. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (r)(2) based on the Veteran's need for higher-level aid and attendance of another is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected disabilities are of such severity that he meets the criteria for aid and attendance under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) and for higher level aid and attendance under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (r)(2). The Board notes that the Veteran's claim for benefits under SMC began as a request for reinstatement of SMC at the (s) rate based on him previously meeting the criteria for statutory housebound. It has since evolved into an explicit claim for the need for both regular aid and attendance and higher-level aid and attendance.

As relevant to the Veteran's claim, SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) is payable when a Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or is permanently bedridden or with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (o) is available if the Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered disability under conditions which would entitle such Veteran to two or more of the rates provided in one or more subsections (l) through (n) of this section, no condition being considered twice in the determination, or if the veteran has suffered bilateral deafness (and the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service connected) rated at 60 percent or more disabling and the veteran has also suffered service-connected total blindness with 20/200 visual acuity or less, or if the veteran has suffered service-connected total deafness in one ear or bilateral deafness (and the hearing impairment in either one or both ears is service connected) rated at 40 percent or more disabling and the veteran has also suffered service-connected blindness having only light perception or less, or if the veteran has suffered the anatomical loss of both arms with factors that prevent the use of prosthetic appliances. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (e).

A Veteran is entitled to the highest level of aid and attendance allowance authorized by 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (r)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (h) in lieu of the regular aid and attendance allowance under section 1114(r)(1) when all of the following conditions are met: (i) the Veteran is entitled to the compensation authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (o) or the maximum rate of compensation authorized under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (p); (ii) the Veteran meets the requirements for entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a); (iii) the Veteran needs a "higher level of care" than is required to establish entitlement to the regular aid and attendance allowance and, in the absence of the provision of such higher level of care, the Veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (b)(1)(i)-(iii).

In December 2024 written argument, the Veteran's representative contended that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, MDD, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus resulted in the Veteran needing not only regular aid and attendance, but a higher level of aid and attendance as his conditions have progressed over the years. The representative points to the Veteran's difficulty performing activities of daily living due to being in a wheelchair. They also pointed to safety concerns related to the Veteran's memory loss associated with his MDD. The Board also notes that the August 2021 private examination found the Veteran had an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living as a result of his MDD; however, it is unclear whether this inability rises to the level of requiring regular aid and attendance.

The Board notes that the Veteran was granted SMC at the (l) rate earlier in this decision for the loss of use of both feet. As such, in order for the Veteran to be awarded SMC at the (l) rate for regular aid and attendance, the Veteran must require such aid and attendance due to his service-connected disabilities that are separate and distinct from his bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. However, while the August 2021 private examination indicates the Veteran's MDD results in the intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, it is unclear whether he requires regular aid and attendance in order to help him complete such activities.  Additionally, while the representative argues that the Veteran's MDD-related memory loss results in him requiring supervision due to safety concerns, it again is unclear whether this rises to the level of a need for regular aid and attendance. Seeing as the evidence raising the possibility that the Veteran's MDD may result in him needing regular aid and attendance was of record prior to the March 2024 rating decision, the Board finds that the AOJs failure to obtain an examination concerning whether the Veteran's disabilities, including his MDD, resulted in the Veteran either being housebound or requiring regular aid and attendance, constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Although the argument for regular aid and attendance was not submitted until after the August 2024 higher level review rating decision, the Board finds that the evidence of record raised the question of whether the Veteran required a need for regular aid and attendance, as shown by VA treatment records noting the Veteran was in a wheelchair and required assistance with activities of daily living and household tasks around July-August 2023.  The August 2021 private examination also raised the possibility that the Veteran's MDD may result in him requiring aid and attendance, based on A.M.H.'s finding the Veteran was intermittently unable to perform activities of daily living. Thus, remand is necessary in order to obtain an examination addressing whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, both singularly and as a whole, result in a need for regular aid and attendance.

As for the claim of entitlement to SMC based on a higher-level of aid and attendance, 38 U.S.C. 1114 (r)(2) requires the Veteran be in receipt of SMC at the (o) or (p) rate. Additionally, SMC at the (o) rate requires the Veteran be eligible of SMC at the (l) rate based on two separate theories of entitlement. However, seeing as the issue of whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC at the (l) rate based on a need for regular aid and attendance is being remanded, the Board finds that the issue of whether the Veteran is eligible for SMC at the (r)(2) rate is inextricably intertwined and must also be remanded. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that a final Board decision cannot be rendered unless both issues have been considered). 

Accordingly, these matters are REMANDED for the following:

1. Determine the correct effective date for the award of 20 percent ratings for the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral anterior tibial, external popliteal, internal popliteal, posterior tibial, and musculocutaneous nerves.

2. Send the Veteran and his representative a rating decision informing them of the effective date of these increased ratings. 

3. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a qualified examiner addressing whether the Veteran's service-connected conditions, whether separately or taken together, result in the Veteran requiring regular aid and attendance.

4. Following this development, adjudicate the claim accordingly.
