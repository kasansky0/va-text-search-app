ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 5, 2022, for the assigned 60 percent rating for service-connected bilateral pseudophakia with dermatochalasis, vitreous degeneration, and benign neoplasm of choroid left eye (bilateral eye disability) is denied.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye disability on July 27, 2021, and continuously appealed the rating assigned for that condition.  It was first ascertainable on August 5, 2022, that the Veteran's bilateral eye disability warranted a rating of 60 percent.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 5, 2022, for the award of a 60 percent evaluation for bilateral eye disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (o) and 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1978 to February 1984.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  The law creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review, and this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

In a February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed July 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions. The Board already issued a decision on February 11, 2025, concerning his appeal of the July 2023 rating decision that denied a higher rating for bronchial asthma. The Board granted a rating of 60 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bronchial asthma effective June 8, 2022, and that decision was implemented by the Regional Office in a February 20, 2025, rating decision. As that issue on the February 2024 VA Form 10182 has already been adjudicated by the Board, it is not addressed further herein. 

Therefore, the remaining issue from the February 2024 VA Form 10182 is the Veteran's appeal of a January 2024 rating decision, which denied an earlier effective date for the assigned 60 percent rating for service-connected bilateral pseudophakia with dermatochalasis, vitreous degeneration, and benign neoplasm of choroid left eye (bilateral eye disability).  In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket for this appeal; the Board will therefore consider only the evidence of record as of the date the January 2024 rating decision was issued.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).  That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing.  In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief... [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section...."  Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice).  In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claim related to the Veteran's bilateral eye disability was filed on VA Form 20-0995 prior to the amended version.  However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error.  

In Bowen, the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity.  Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012).  The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice.  Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.  The January 25, 2024, notification letter informing the Veteran of the rating decision included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board.  Additionally, in the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran instead selected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge, and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing.  Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level.  See Bowen. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than August 5, 2022, for the assigned 60 percent rating for his service-connected bilateral eye disability.  In a September 2023 statement, the Veteran contended that it was first factually ascertainable that his bilateral eye disability increased in severity in January 2022, when the last of his surgery and follow-up appointments occurred that established seven or more treatment visits were required. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), the effective date of an increase in a veteran's disability compensation 'shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2) provides an exception to this general rule: "The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date."

Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of an increased rating earlier effective date case:

(1) If an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1));

(2) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)); or

(3) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim).

38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).

By way of background, the Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for cataracts in a July 27, 2021, VA Form 21-526EZ.  A September 2022 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral cataracts with an evaluation of 10 percent effective July 27, 2021, a 30 percent evaluation effective December 27, 2021, and a 60 percent evaluation effective August 5, 2022. The Veteran then filed a VA 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on October 12, 2022, claiming, in part, an increased rating for the bilateral eye disability.  An April 26, 2023, rating decision, continued the 60 percent rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  

On June 8, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, requesting, in part, an increased rating for his bilateral eye disability, and he then filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, on June 10, 2023.  A June 14, 2023, rating decision continued the 60 percent rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  However, the Veteran was provided a VA eye conditions examination on July 24, 2023, so a July 31, 2023, rating decision continued the denial of a disability rating in excess of 60 percent.  

On September 14, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, requesting an earlier effective date for the grant of a 60 percent rating for his bilateral eye disability.  He argued that it was first factually ascertainable his condition worsened in January 2022, as opposed to August 5, 2022, as that was the last of the surgery and follow-ups that established the 7 or more treatment visits required for the 60 percent rating. In an October 2023 statement, he alleged the worsening was established by February 2022. The January 20, 2024, rating decision on appeal denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of the Veteran's bilateral eye disability. 

On this procedural history, the Board finds two distinct issues for consideration.  Under the AMA, claimants may elect one of three administrative review options within one year from the date on which the AOJ issues a notice of a decision on a claim: a request for higher-level review (HLR) under § 3.2601; an appeal to the Board under § 20.202; or a supplemental claim under § 3.2501. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (a). The modernized appeal system expressly prohibits the concurrent election of review options. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b) ("a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."). Recently, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized this prohibition, holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023). The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple review requests were "not pending concurrently" as such would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A); Id at 2. As such, the Court's holding in Terry makes clear that only one review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. Id.  

Additionally, as to all claims subject to the modernized review system, which includes the present appeal, claimants may "preserve" an effective date following issuance of a decision by an RO by "timely and properly filing [an enumerated] administrative review [option]," to include filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).  If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).  Although the date of claim is preserved when a claim is continuously pursued, the proper effective date is still subject to a finding regarding when entitlement to the benefit sought arose. "The date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) interpreted this language as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, as determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

As noted above, the Veteran's claim was originally granted in a September 2022 rating decision, effective July 27, 2021.  Thereafter, on October 12, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting higher initial ratings for his now service-connected bilateral eye disability.  An April 2023 rating decision increased the rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability to 60 percent effective August 5, 2022.  Subsequently on June 8, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting increased ratings for his bilateral eye disability.  Additionally, on June 10, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim.  Importantly, the June 10, 2023, supplemental claim was received within one year of the September 16, 2022, rating decision that originally granted service-connection.  Additionally, in the June 2023 rating decision the RO noted that a Veteran may file a supplemental claim by submitting or identifying new and relevant evidence and concluded that in support of his claim, new and relevant evidence had been received.  As such, the June 2023 rating decision identified the June 10, 2023, VA Form 20-0995 as the administrative review option, not the June 8, 2023, VA Form 526EZ. Despite the fact he filed two VA Forms 526EZ within the year following the September 2022 rating decision, he still filed an appropriate review option - a supplemental claim - within that one-year period. Such actions are not prohibited by the rules against concurrent election, as VA Form 526EZ is not one of the appeal options listed in the regulation; it is a new claim.  

As such, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued the claim addressed in the September 16, 2022, rating decision, which was the July 27, 2021 claim.

In light of the above background, the Board finds that the relevant period for consideration of the Veteran's earlier effective date claim for the assigned increased rating extends to his original July 27, 2021, effective date of service connection for a bilateral eye disability. Again, however, continuous pursuit alone is not a guarantee that any increased rating will date back to receipt of claim.

The Veteran's bilateral eye disability is rated as 10 percent disabling prior to December 27, 2021, 30 percent disabling from December 27, 2021, to August 4, 2022, and 60 percent disabling from August 5, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6027-6066.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional code to identify the basis for the assigned evaluation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Under the criteria for impairment of visual acuity, a 10 percent rating is warranted when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/50, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, and vision in other eye is 20/40; or when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, and vision in the other eye is 20/40.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6066.

In order to receive the next higher level rating of 20, the evidence must demonstrate visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/70, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/100, and vision in the other eye is 20/50; when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 20/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40; or when visual acuity in one eye (the poorer eye) is 15/200, and vision in the other eye is 20/40.  Id. 

Under Diagnostic Code 6027, preoperative cataracts are rated under the General Rating Formula. Postoperative cataracts are rated under the General Rating Formula if there is a replacement lens present or under Diagnostic Code 6029 for aphakia if there are not replacement lens present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent rating is assigned where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  A 20 percent rating is assigned where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  A 40 percent rating is assigned where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  A maximum, 60 percent rating is assigned where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  Id.

Under Note 1 of the General Rating Formula, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.  Under Note 2 of the General Rating Formula, examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: Systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions.

The Veteran was provided a VA eye conditions examination in December 2021.  The Veteran reported blurred vision and difficult reading.  He reported no current symptoms.  Upon examination, the Veteran demonstrated uncorrected distance of the right eye of 5/200 or worse and left eye 20/40; corrected vision of the right eye 10/200 and left eye 20/40; uncorrected near vision of the right eye 10/200 and left eye 20/70; corrected near right eye vision 20/200 and left eye 20/40.  The Veteran did not have a difference equal to two or more lines of the Snellen test type chart or its equivalent between distance and near corrected vision, with the near vision being worse.  Additionally, the Veteran did not have anatomical loss, light perception only, extremely poor vision or blindness of either eye.  He did not have corneal irregularity that results in severe irregular astigmatism or diploma.  The VA examiner noted that during the past 12 months the Veteran had at least 1 but less than 3 incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition.  The Veteran's eye condition did not impact his ability to work. 

A January 4, 2022, VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran had nuclear sclerotic cataract surgery of the right eye.  On January 5, 2022, the Veteran had a post operative visit at the Bay Pines VAMC.  A January 12, 2022, VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran cancelled a post operation appointment due to an asthma attack.  The Veteran noted he did not have pain.  A January 18, 2022, VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran had a post operative appointment and reported that he is better since his last eye examination and has no pain.  A March 15, 2022, VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran had a post operative appointment and reported satisfactory vision and that he has completed his drop regimen following surgery.       

The Veteran was provided a VA examination on August 5, 2022.  The Veteran reported no current symptoms.  Upon examination, the Veteran demonstrated bilateral uncorrected distance vision of 20/20 or better; bilateral corrected vision distance of 20/20 or better; bilateral uncorrected near vision of 20/50; and corrected near vision of 20/20 or better.  The Veteran did not have a difference equal to two or more lines of the Snellen test type chart or its equivalent between distance and near corrected vision, with the near vision being worse.  Additionally, the Veteran did not have anatomical loss, light perception only, extremely poor vision or blindness of either eye.  He did not have corneal irregularity that results in severe irregular astigmatism or diploma.  The VA examiner noted that during the past 12 months the Veteran had at 7 or more incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition.       

The December 2021 VA examination reflects that the Veteran had at least 1 but less than 3 incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition in the past 12 months.  During the August 2022 VA examination, the Veteran was noted to have 7 or more incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition during the past 12 months.  As such, the August 2022 VA examination, supports a rating of 60 percent.  Additionally, the December 2021 VA examination, did not demonstrate the level of severity for a 60 percent rating since the Veteran did not have 7 or more incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition during the past 12 months.  In short, it was first ascertainable from the evidence of record that his bilateral eye symptoms and functional limitations warranted a 60 percent rating on August 5, 2022.  There is no basis to award a 60 percent rating prior to August 5, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (o) (1) and 3.25000(h) (1).  The available evidence describing the severity of the Veteran's bilateral eye disability prior to August 5, 2022, indicates that the Veteran's bilateral eye disability did not manifest in 7 or more incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition, corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6027-6066.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a 60 percent rating effective January 2022 due to his eye surgery and follow up appointments.  However, as noted above a 60 percent rating is assigned where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months.  Following his January 2022 eye surgery the Veteran did not report incapacitating episodes.  The Veteran reported that he did not have pain and had satisfactory vision.  As noted above, under Note 1 of the General Rating Formula, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes.  Under Note 2 of the General Rating Formula, examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: Systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions.  The Veteran's VA treatment records do not reflect treatment such as systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions following his January 2022 right eye surgery.  As such, the record does not indicate that the Veteran's bilateral eye disability manifested in 7 or more incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition, corresponding to the criteria for a 60 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6027-6066 following his January 2022 surgery.

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the claim, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 5, 2022, for the award of a 60 percent rating for service-connected bilateral eye disability is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
