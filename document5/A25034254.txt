FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On November 18, 2019, the Veteran received notice regarding a rating decision denying his claim for service connection for end stage renal disease, regarding which the Veteran did not seek any additional administrative review within one year of the date of the notice associated with that rating decision denial. 

2. On January 4, 2022, the Veteran filed an intent to file application, and the Veteran's complete supplemental claim for service connection for end stage renal disease was received on February 3, 2022, with no other valid completed claims for benefits filed between January 4, 2022, and February 3, 2022.

3. The Veteran's February 3, 2022, supplemental claim for service connection for end stage renal disease was received within one year of the January 4, 2022, intent to file application; the Veteran subsequently filed additional administrative review forms to keep his February 3, 2022, supplemental claim in continuous pursuit.

4. The Veteran has met basic eligibility for DEA based on permanent and total disability status from January 4, 2022.

5. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his diabetes mellitus was at least as likely as not etiologically related to his active service.

6. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his hypertension was at least as likely as not etiologically related to his active service.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service in the United States Navy from November 1971 to March 1973.  

The Veteran filed a disability claim that was received on August 15, 2019, and in November 2019, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying service connection for, among other things, kidney disease.  See Rating Decision, Receipt Date: November 15, 2019.  The Veteran did not timely seek administrative review of that decision, and the decision became final.  

Subsequently, on January 4, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0290, intent to file application, and his complete supplemental claim for service connection for end stage renal disease was received on February 3, 2022, with no other valid completed claims for benefits filed between January 4, 2022, and February 3, 2022.  

The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim, to include entitlement to service connection for end stage renal disease, in a March 1, 2022, rating decision.  Thereafter, the Veteran continuously pursued the claim by filing an administrative review option within one year of each prior denial.  Specifically, in May 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2022 decision.  However, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error in its failure to obtain records and the HLR application was converted to a supplemental claim whereupon the Veteran was scheduled for examinations which were completed in December 2022, with a rating decision denial received that same month.  

In August 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, supplemental claim for his end stage renal disease service connection claim, along with a private medical opinion.  The Veteran also filed a separate VA Form 21-526EZ in August 2023, for service connection for (separately) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which was denied in an October 3, 2023, rating decision.  

However, in a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted the claim for service connection for end stage renal disease at 100 percent effective August 10, 2022.  See Rating Decision, Receipt Date: September 18, 2023.  In November 2023, the AOJ received a VA Form 20-0996 Request for HLR, wherein the Veteran requested review of the October 2023 denial for service connection for (separately) diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and the effective dates associated with the September 2023 grants of service connection for end stage renal disease and of DEA benefits.  

Evidence considered by the AOJ in an HLR decision is limited to the evidence considered in the rating decision for which HLR is requested.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2601(f). Thus, in this case, the evidence considered by the AOJ was limited to evidence received by September 18, 2023 (for end stage renal disease and DEA), and October 3, 2023 (for diabetes mellitus and hypertension).  The AOJ denied all four claims in the December 20, 2023, HLR rating decision on appeal.  The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the review system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) applies.  Under the AMA the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) is bound by favorable findings made by the AOJ.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected direct review.  See VA Form 10182, Receipt Date: January 26, 2024.  The direct review lane means the Board will review the same record as was before the AOJ in the rating decision appealed from.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 18, 2023, rating decision (for end stage renal disease and DEA), and the October 3, 2023, rating decision (for diabetes mellitus and hypertension).  38 C.F.R. §?20.301.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 4, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for end stage renal disease.

The Veteran's attorney contends that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the grant of service connection for end stage renal disease.  See VA Form 10182, Receipt Date: January 26, 2024.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date upon receipt of new and material/relevant evidence after a final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2).  If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  There is a liberalizing regulation to the general rule that applies in the context of increased rating claims; however, such is not applicable under the facts of this case.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

To that point, a decision assigning an effective date for a service-connected disability becomes final when the decision is not appealed, and an appellant can only attempt to overcome finality of the decision by a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error, or by a claim to reopen based upon new and material evidence.  The proper effective date for an award based on a claim to reopen could be no earlier than the date on which that claim was received, and only a request for revision based on clear and unmistakable error could result in the assignment of an earlier effective date.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006).  

The regulations further provide that where the VA receives an intent to file a claim followed by a complete application form within 1 year of the receipt of the intent to file claim, the VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.

Therefore, the question for the Board is whether any intent to file or any complete claim for benefits for end stage renal disease was received by the VA prior to the currently assigned effective date of August 10, 2022.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that an effective date of January 4, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for service connection for end stage renal disease.  

As outlined above, the Veteran did not timely seek administrative review of the November 15, 2019, rating decision denying his original disability claim that was received in August 2019, and that decision became final.  Thereafter, the Veteran's VA Form 21-0290, intent to file application was received on January 4, 2022, and his complete supplemental claim for service connection for end stage renal disease was received on February 3, 2022, squarely within one year of the intent to file application, with no other valid completed claims for benefits filed between January 4, 2022, and February 3, 2022.  As such, the Veteran's supplemental claim is treated as received on the date of the intent to file application, January 4, 2022.

Thereafter, the Veteran continuously pursued the claim by filing an administrative review option within one year of each prior rating decision with which the Veteran disagreed.  Specifically, after the March 1, 2022, rating decision denial, in May 2022, the Veteran filed a HLR application and requested review of the March 2022 decision.  The HLR application was converted to a supplemental claim and a rating decision denial was received in December 2022.  

In August 2023, within one year of the December 2022 denial, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for his end stage renal disease service connection claim, along with a private medical opinion, and the claim was granted in a September 2023 rating decision.  See Rating Decision, Receipt Date: September 18, 2023.  In November 2023, within one year of the September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ received a VA Form 20-0996 Request for HLR, wherein the Veteran requested review of rating decisions to include the effective dates associated with the September 2023 grants of service connection for end stage renal disease and of DEA benefits.  The AOJ denied the claims in the December 20, 2023, HLR rating decision on appeal, and the Veteran filed the VA Form 10182 in January 2024, within one year of the December 2023 denial.

Therefore, as the Veteran continuously pursued the claim, his claim dates back to January 4, 2022, the initial intent to file application which is imputed as the date of his subsequent supplemental claim.  Consequently, the Board finds that an effective date of January 4, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for end stage renal disease, and the appeal is granted to that extent only.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.159, 3.400

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 4, 2022, but no earlier, for eligibility for DEA, under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

The Veteran's attorney contends that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of DEA benefits.  See VA Form 10182, Receipt Date: January 26, 2024.

For purposes of entitlement to DEA benefits, basic eligibility exists if, among other things, a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

When end stage renal disease was granted at 100 percent effective August 10, 2022, the basic eligibility for DEA was established.  DEA benefits may not be awarded prior to the effective date of an award of a permanent and total disability rating.  For the reasons set forth above, the Board herein is granting end stage renal disease from January 4, 2022.  Therefore, the Board concludes that entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is also warranted from January 4, 2022.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran through his attorney contends that his in-service exposure to benzene and organic solvents caused him to develop diabetes mellitus.

The Veteran has a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus II, pursuant to an October 2023 VA examination, and as per his VA treatment records.  Likewise, the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension, pursuant to an October 2023 VA examination. Therefore, the questions before the Board are whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, are each and separately related to service.  On these questions, there is evidence in favor of and against the claims.  For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that for both diabetes mellitus and hypertension, the Veteran has a current disability that is related to his military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Pertinent VA examinations and/or medical opinions were provided in October 2023 and December 2023; however, none of these included favorable opinions.  To the extent that the October 2023 medical opinions for diabetes mellitus and hypertension each rely on the absence of medical or scientific evidence as the primary rationale, without discussing the Veteran's specific medical history and disease pathology, the Board finds that these opinions are inadequate.  In the December 2023 VA medical opinion on diabetes mellitus, the VA examiner's rationale is based on lack of evidence for long-term toxic exposures, without explaining what constitutes "long-term" exposures in the context of active-duty military service.  

Likewise, in the medical opinion regarding hypertension, although the December 2023 VA examiner found evidence of associative links between exposure to diesel fuels, chemical off gassing from heating and burning, as well as volatile organic compounds, and causation of hypertension, the VA medical examiner's rationale is based on the fact that the findings are "dose related" and isolated to active or chronic exposure, without adequately addressing why the Veteran's specific exposures could not be deemed either active or chronic.  Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the October 2023 and December 2023 VA medical opinions have less probative value.

The evidence in favor of the claims for diabetes mellitus and hypertension includes an August 2023 private medical opinion, which clearly includes the Veteran's medical history and a thorough of how his claimed exposure to benzene (dioxins) and organic solvents is at least as likely as not the cause of the Veteran's diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  The private physician suggests that the Veteran's exposure to organic solvents to include benzene is the single most important risk factor for the Veteran in developing diabetes mellitus, given that he had no family history for it.  The private physician then details how diabetes mellitus type II can lead to renal failure and hypertension through various mechanisms involving insulin resistance, kidney damage, and altered blood vessel function.  The private physician states that on a molecular level, benzene and organic solvents are hydrocarbons which remain in certain body tissues for a long time (even decades) such that target organ exposure continues even after external exposure ceases, and even when the external exposure was brief.  Given the foregoing, the private physician concludes that the Veteran's exposures to these organic solvents is at least as likely as not the cause of the Veteran's diabetes mellitus II, hypertension, and end stage renal disease.

The Board finds that the August 2023 private medical opinion has greater probative value because it is based on an accurate medical history, including consideration of the length of time of the Veteran's claimed in-service exposures, and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  

The Board acknowledges the unfavorable medical evidence of record, highlighting the deficiencies in the medical rationales as noted above.  The Board concludes that the unfavorable medical nexus evidence on the one hand, and the favorable medical evidence, on the other hand, are at least in approximate balance as to the question of whether the Veteran's current diabetes mellitus and hypertension are each and separately etiologically related to his military service.  Given the foregoing, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor to find that service connection is warranted for diabetes mellitus and hypertension; the claims are thus granted in full.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
