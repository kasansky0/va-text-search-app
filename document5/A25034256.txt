ORDER

A 100 percent rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from October 7, 2015, is granted. 

Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) Entitlement from October 7, 2015, is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an extra-schedular rating for total disability due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, it is at least as likely as not that his PTSD warranted a total disability rating from October 7, 2015. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD from October 7, 2015, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155(b), 3.400.

The criteria for the award of DEA from October 7, 2015, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155(b), 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to January 1992.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2021 decision.  In December 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2021 decision.  

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an extra-schedular rating for a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Earlier Effective Date

Under the modernized review system, an effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim will be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but the effective date cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38?U.S.C. §?5110(a)(1). 

Further, when a claim has been continuously pursued, the date of application shall be considered the date of the filing of the initial application for a benefit. 38?U.S.C. §?5110(a)(2).

The effective date of an increased rating will be the earliest date which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date VA received the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

	

PTSD

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board 

must conduct a holistic analysis that considers all associated symptoms, 

regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 (2018). The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez Claudio v. 

Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114 118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

  

Under Diagnostic Code 9411 of the General Formula, a 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of closest relatives, own occupation, or own name. 

 

The symptoms listed in Diagnostic Code 9411 are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). 

 

Factual Background

The Veteran contends a total disability rating for his PTSD is warranted prior to August 30, 2021. See December 2023 Notice of Disagreement. 

By way of history, the Veteran was granted a 50 percent rating for his PTSD in a January 2011 rating decision which was not appealed by the Veteran and became final. The Veteran's claim for rating higher than 50 percent for his service-connected PTSD was received by VA on October 5, 2016. His claim was denied in a January 2017 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a June 2017 Notice of Disagreement. His claim for a rating greater than 50 percent for his PTSD was again denied in a March 2019 rating decision. In February 2020 the Veteran requested a HLR of the March 2019 rating decision. A July 2020 rating decision continued the Veteran's 50 percent rating for PTSD. VA then received the Veteran's August 2021 Supplemental Claim within 1 year of the issuance of the July 2020 Decision. A September 2021 rating decision granted the Veteran a 100 percent rating from August 2, 2021. In September 2022 the Veteran requested a HLR of the September 2021 rating decision. The December 2022 HLR decision on appeal granted the Veteran a 100 percent PTSD rating from August 30, 2021.

As noted above, the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim for in increased rating for PTSD since October 2016. Within one year of each rating decision issued by the VA Regional Office since this time, he filed an appropriate review option request, and the January 2017 AOJ decision has not become final. Given these facts, the Board must determine whether there is factually ascertainable evidence of an increase in the Veteran's PTSD symptoms beginning one year before the October 5, 2016 Claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Analysis

From October 7, 2015, the Veteran exhibited gross impairment of thought processes and at times grossly inappropriate behavior such as angry outbursts which have resulted in an inability to effectively communicate with others. The Veteran's family noticed his angry outbursts and outrageous behavior and encouraged him to seek mental health treatment. See September 27, 2016 Mental Health Note. Ultimately, his unchecked anger and aggression resulted an incident at his home that ended with his arrest and confinement. See April 30, 2018 Mental Health Evaluation Note. 

The Veteran has described his mood as "irritable, angry all the time." Id. In addition to his angry outbursts the Veteran reported taking risks that could cause him harm. See May 2, 2018 Mental Health Evaluation. At times the Veteran presented a danger of hurting himself or others due to his angry and aggressive behavior. See April 30, 2018 Mental Health Evaluation Note, February 20, 2019 Mental Health Note, February 25, 2021 Mental Health Note, and August 2021 VA Examination. His behavior is consistent with a gross impairment of thought process as contemplated in the 100 percent rating criteria.

Further, his hypervigilance has resulted in severe sleep disturbances. See October 7, 2015 Mental Health Note. At times the Veteran reported that he was not able to get more than 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. See June 13, 2018 Psychology Progress Note. In fact, he has reported that due to his stressor related nightmares, he sometimes avoided sleep. See February 20, 2019 Mental Health Note.  The Veteran's PTSD related sleep disruptions affect nearly all aspects of his life and are of the severity and frequency more approximate to a total disability rating. 

Accordingly, the Veteran is granted a 100 percent rating for his PTSD from October 7, 2015.

DEA

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if the following conditions are met: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

As decided above, the Veteran's PTSD is rated as 100 percent disabling as of October 7, 2015. Given that his PTSD is a total disability, permanent in nature, as of October 7, 2015, the same date is assigned for the Veteran's eligibility for DEA benefits. Accordingly, his appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

TDIU

The Veteran, through his representative, contends he is entitled to a TDIU prior to February 25, 2021. Specifically, the Veteran's representative asserted the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU effective October 5, 2016.  See December 2023 Notice of Disagreement. 

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a). 

The Veteran's current disability ratings are 100 percent for PTSD from October 7, 2015, a 50 percent rating for obstructive sleep apnea from August 2, 2021, and a 10 percent rating for hypertension from October 5, 2016. 

The Board notes the Veteran was granted a TDIU from February 25, 2021, based solely on his service-connected PTSD. See December 2022 Rating Decision. Due to the Veteran's 100 percent PTSD rating, a TDIU based solely on his PTSD is no longer warranted. 

The Veteran's 100 percent rating for PTSD aside, he has no other disabilities rated at 60%, and his two other disability ratings combined are not 70 percent. Thus, he is not eligible for a schedular TDIU rating. The issue of entitlement to an extra-schedular TDIU based on the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension remains relevant because a grant of this issue may render the Veteran eligible for Special Monthly Compensation (SMC). SMC may be granted when an award of TDIU is based on multiple disabilities, and a separate single disability is rated either 100% or results in a TDIU on its own. Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2010).

The evidence of record shows a reasonable possibility that the Veteran may have been unemployable due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension.  

The Veteran contends that his last period of full-time gainful employment ended in October 2008.  See July 2018 Application for Increased Compensation. The Veteran contends he became too disabled to work in September 2007.  Id. In a July 2018 affidavit the Veteran asserted that the medications he was prescribed for his service-connected hypertension prevented him from continuing work as a truck driver. He also reported his sleep disruptions caused low concentration and aggravated his PTSD which precluded him from working with others. 

The AOJ failed to consider an extraschedular TDUI rating by not referring the issue of extraschedular TDIU to the Director, Compensation Services.  This failure amounts to a pre-decisional duty to assist error. A remand is necessary to correct the error and satisfy a regulatory duty under 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Refer the claim to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of an of an extraschedular TDIU rating due to his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension.
