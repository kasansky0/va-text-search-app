ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 21, 2019, for the 70 percent rating for unspecified anxiety disorder and depressive disorder is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 21, 2019, for the grant of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. It is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected unspecified anxiety and depressive disorder met the 70 percent criteria prior to May 21, 2019. 

2. It is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation prior to May 21, 2019.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 21, 2019, for the 70 percent rating for unspecified anxiety disorder and depressive disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, §4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434-9413.

2. The criteria for a TDIU prior to May 21, 2019, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, § 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1964 to May 1967.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In a February 2024 decision, the Board denied the Veteran's claims. The Veteran appealed to the US Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. In November 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Remand of the parties and returned the matter to the Board for action consistent with the Joint Motion for Remand.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 21, 2019, for the 70 percent rating for unspecified anxiety disorder and depressive disorder.

The Veteran contends he is entitled an effective date prior to May 21, 2019, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for connected unspecified anxiety disorder and depressive disorder. Specifically, he contends that he filed timely appeals at every appropriate stage, warranting a finding of continuous pursuit of an increased rating since August 6, 2012. Unfortunately, the law and the evidence do not warrant an earlier effective date.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award of compensation shall be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

Regarding the assignment of effective dates for an increased rating claim, "the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date." See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2). Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of an increased rating earlier effective date case: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2)); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim). 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).

A "claim" is defined in the VA regulations as "a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d), a complete claim is required for all types of claims and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation of award of benefits. If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim that meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b), it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file a claim.

Initially, the Board must determine the date of receipt of the claim. 

By way of history, in a May 2020 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include depression and anxiety disorder. Currently the Veteran's disability is rated as 30 percent disabling from August 6, 2012, and 70 percent from May 21, 2019. In this case, because the Veteran is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit available at the time of application and the Veteran has continuously pursued his appeal, the Board finds that August 6, 2012, is the date of receipt of the claim for an increased rating in the instant matter.

With the date of receipt of claim fixed, the Board must next determine when a worsening of symptoms for the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder became "factually ascertainable" to warrant a 70 percent rating. 

The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder has been evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434-9413. Under the General Rating Formula For Mental Disorders, a 70 percent evaluation is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

Consideration is given to the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remission, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission. The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment, rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a). Furthermore, when evaluating the level of disability arising from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b). It is necessary to evaluate a disability from the point of view of the Veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

Here, the September 2023 rating decision noted that the increase to a 70 percent rating was based on a May 21, 2019, private treatment records that show that the Veteran was experiencing severe anxiety with panic attacks. The RO found that this was the first indication of an increase in disability. 

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2012. The examiner concluded that a mental condition had been formally diagnosed but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication. The examiner noted that the Veteran was married with two grown children and that he was an engineer for 14 years and retired in 2009. The examiner did not note any symptoms but did note that the Veteran was sad and anxious.  

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in September 2018 but the Board in a prior decision determined this examination was inadequate. Consequently, in March 2022 the Board remanded the claim for a new VA opinion. A new VA opinion was provided in May 2022. 

The May 2022 examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms included worry, anxiety, depressed mood, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent           events, difficulty in understanding complex commands, disturbances of motivation and mood, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. The examiner stated the Veteran asked his wife to be present during interview "as a support and source of comfort". Additionally, the Veteran came on time, had tremors in both hands, dressed appropriately, used good eye contact, affect was sad, and mood was tense and anxious. No suicidal or homicidal or aggressive ideations or plans were expressed. The Veteran was alert and well oriented to time, place, person and place. The examiner noted that no paranoia, no thought disorder or psychosis was present, and the Veteran was a reliable historian. The examiner expressed that the Veteran's service-connected disability of Unspecified Anxiety Disorder had increased in severity and was preventing Veteran from being able to have regular work. 

Other evidence of record prior to May 21, 2019, does not show symptoms different than the ones noted in the VA examinations. The Board acknowledges the lay statements submitted by the Veteran and his family members describing his difficulties with anxiety, daily habits, memory, anger, minimal relationships, sleep, mood, and panic attacks. The Board finds that these reports are not sufficient to support the Veteran's service-connected unspecified anxiety and depressive disorder met the 70 percent criteria prior to May 21, 2019.  Although the lay statements discuss symptomology within the 70 percent criteria, they do not indicate the Veteran experienced these symptoms prior to May 21, 2019, and the symptomology expressed in the lay statements are not supported by the medical record prior to May 21, 2019. 

As noted above, the assignment of an effective date for an increased rating turns not only on the date of claim, but also the date that it was factually ascertainable that an increase was warranted. Here, a review of the evidence in this case shows that prior to May 21, 2019, the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran met the rating criteria for a 70 percent rating for his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder.

In this regard, the Board finds that prior to May 21, 2019, the Veteran's disability was manifested by depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, sadness, worry, loss of interest, feeling fatigued, and irritability.  Collectively, these symptoms are of the type, extent, severity and/or frequency to result in occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent period of inability to perform occupational tasks. 

The evidence does not, however, reflect that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder manifested with more severe manifestations that more nearly approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, prior to May 21, 2019. With respect to the 70 percent criteria, the Court has held that "the regulation also requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the veteran's level of impairment in 'most areas." Vazquez-Claudio, supra.

Prior to May 21, 2019, the Veteran did not have suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 

Instead, the Veteran's mental status examination was noted as normal and the Veteran did not report any issues with social activities or that his acquired psychiatric disability affected his occupation. 

The Board emphasizes that, in analyzing this claim, the symptoms identified in the Rating Formula have been considered not as an exhaustive list of symptoms, but as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or effects, that would justify a particular rating. The Board has not required the presence of a specified quantity of symptoms in the rating schedule to warrant a higher rating. See Mauerhan, supra.

In sum, although the date of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating was in August 2012, it was not until May 21, 2019, that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's disability met the criteria for a 70 percent rating. Prior to that date, the evidence reflects that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder most nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational task consistent with the currently assigned 30 percent rating.

Therefore, the evidence does not establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability prior to May 21, 2019. As there is no evidentiary basis for an earlier effective date for an increased rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 21, 2019, for the grant of TDIU.

A claim for entitlement to a TDIU is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim. See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). Therefore, an effective date of a TDIU claim may be awarded during the one-year period prior to receipt of the claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred during that one-year period. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). However, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date of claim. Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F. 3d 979, 984 (2010).

The law provides that a TDIU may be granted upon a showing that the veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to impairment resulting from his service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. Consideration may be given to a Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his or his age or the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

To qualify for a total rating for compensation purposes, the evidence must show (1) a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling; or (2) that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his or his service-connected disabilities, with one disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or, for more than one disability, at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and a combined disability rating of 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a TDIU effective May 19, 2019. 

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's date of claim for his TDIU application is August 6, 2012, as discussed above. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). With the date of receipt of claim fixed, the Board must next determine when it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation. 

The Veteran is currently service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder rated as 30 percent from August 6, 2012, and as 70 percent from May 21, 2019; right hand essential tremor rated as 20 percent disabling from August 6, 2012; tinnitus rated as 10 percent from February 12, 2015; and bilateral hearing loss rating as noncompensable from February 12, 2015. Therefore, the Veteran did not meet the schedular criteria for a TDIU until May 19, 2019. 

Where a veteran does not meet the percentage evaluation requirements under 4.16(a), he still may be deemed totally disabled on an extraschedular basis under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b) when the evidence nonetheless indicates that the veteran is unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities. Under such circumstance the matter is referred to the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service ("Director") for consideration. Id.; see also Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337 (1996); Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218 (1995). Extraschedular TDIU consideration requires contemplation of the following factors: severity of the veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). Although the Board does not have the authority to award an extraschedular TDIU prior to referral to the Director, the Board has jurisdiction to review and award extraschedular ratings in claims that have been denied by the Director. See Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 447 (2015). When denying an extraschedular TDIU referral to the Director under § 4.16(b), the Board must make two determinations in its decision: (1) that a referral for extraschedular TDIU is not warranted under the "reasonable possibility" standard, and (2) that TDIU benefits are not warranted because the veteran is not unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019); see also Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

Turning to the evidence of record, on his March 2020 TDIU application, the Veteran reported that he was unemployable due to all of his service-connected disabilities. The Veteran reported that he last worked full time December 31, 2000, in community relations. The Veteran noted that he had a master's degree. 

A December 2012 examination shows that the examiner concluded that a mental condition had been formally diagnosed but symptoms are not severe enough to either interfere with occupational and social functioning or requiring continuous medication. 

A July 2015 VA examination shows that in regard to his hearing loss the Veteran reported that he misses conversation and requires repetitions. He noted that he has to face the speaker in a conversation, and he utilizes speech reading. He also noted difficulty hearing in the presence of competing noise. He noted difficulty hearing female voices. In regard to his tinnitus, the Veteran reported that the tinnitus is distracting and affects concentration. He also noted that the tinnitus keeps him awake.

A July 2018 VA examination shows that in regard to his hearing loss the Veteran reported that "Hearing loss caused me to miss a lot in my life. I've often felt excluded from conversations, or I am the brunt of laughter when I've given a totally wrong answer, etc. Family understands and compensates. However, that's not what you experience in the outside world." In regard to his tinnitus the Veteran reported that "tinnitus is just plain annoying. You simply can't escape it without a radio or TV, or the furnace blower running 24/7. Sleeping has been hard sometimes too."

A May 2022 VA examination shows that a VA examiner concluded that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. The examiner also noted that the Veteran was a retired industrial engineer and that the Veteran had a bachelor's and master's degree. The examiner stated it is more likely than not that the Veteran s service-connected disability of Unspecified Anxiety Disorder has increased in severity and is preventing Veteran from being able to have regular work.

The Board finds that prior to May 21, 2019, the evidence weighs against a finding that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unemployable or unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation.  

While the evidence of record shows that the Veteran has limitations due to his service-connected disabilities, the evidence prior to May 21, 2019, does not show that his service-connected disabilities prevent him from securing and following a substantially gainful occupation. Instead, the evidence prior to May 21, 2019, does not suggest that he is unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities. As such, referral for extraschedular consideration is not warranted. A TDIU is therefore denied.
