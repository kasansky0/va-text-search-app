ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension, is denied.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC), based on the need for aid and attendance, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On October 16, 2014, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected hypertension.

2. Subsequently, in an October 2018 DRO rating decision, service connection was granted for chronic renal disease combined with hypertension, and assigned a 60 percent rating effective from October 16, 2014. The Veteran did not appeal the October 2018 DRO rating decision.

3. On December 3, 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, and in January 2019 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation, seeking an increased rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension.

4. New and material evidence, which was in the form of a February 2019 VA examination and private treatment records submitted in January 2019, was received within one year of the October 2018 DRO rating decision.

5. The evidence does not show that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's chronic renal disease with hypertension met the criteria for an 80 percent increased rating prior to December 3, 2018.

6. The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran was in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person as a result of his service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.400, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7530, 19.2.

2. The criteria for SMC by reason of the need for regular aid and attendance of another person have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.351, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from September 1958 to March 1982. 

In a January 2021 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) awarded an increased rating of 80 percent from December 3, 2018, for chronic renal disease with hypertension, and denied entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance. In November 2021, the Appellant appealed the January 2021 rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. Under direct review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of the January 2021 rating decision.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in March 2020. The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse, who has successfully substituted as Appellant on the claims for an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension and entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance, which were pending at the time of the Veteran's death.

Additionally, the Board notes that in the November 2021 VA Form 10182, the Appellant also appealed the issue of "check award and start date," identifying the January 2021 rating decision, as well as the issue of Hepatitis B, identifying the January 2021 rating decision and an August 2013 rating decision. The Board finds that regarding the issue of check award and start date, the calculation of the Appellant's award as well as any offsets, including an explanation of how the AOJ determined the awarded amount, is not an appealable issue and has not been addressed by the AOJ. Therefore, the Board finds that this matter is not presently before the Board for adjudication, and the Appellant should contact the AOJ if she wishes to pursue this matter. Further, the Board finds that the issue of Hepatitis B was not adjudicated in the January 2021 rating decision on appeal and is therefore not presently before the Board. 

EARLIER EFFECTIVE DATE

Generally, the effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

Additionally, an effective date for increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if the application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). "[A]n increase in a veteran's service-connected disability must have occurred during the one-year period prior to the date of the Veteran's claim in order to receive the benefit of an earlier effective date." Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010). If the increase in disability is shown to have occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997). In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," all of the evidence must be looked to, including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions, and an effective date must be assigned based on that evidence. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35-36.

When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later reopened claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies. In such cases the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(q)(2), 3.400(r); Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Additionally, regarding legacy cases, submission of new and material evidence within one year of a rating decision delays finality of the rating decision until such time as readjudication of the claim with consideration of that evidence occurs and that decision becomes final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Although the Board typically considers only those factors contained wholly in the rating criteria, it is appropriate to consider factors outside the specific rating criteria when appropriate in order to best determine the level of occupational and social impairment. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

Where there is a question as to which of two separate evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria required for that particular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased during the appeal period, "staged" ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999), Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE

Ratings regarding chronic renal disease are assigned under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, and are to be rated as renal dysfunction under DC 7530. The Board notes that effective November 14, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating dysfunctions of the genitourinary system under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. As this revision was made subsequent to the Veteran's death, only the rating criteria prior to the revision, are applicable in the present case. 

A rating of 60 percent is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a when the evidence demonstrates renal dysfunction causing: constant albuminuria with some edema; or, definite decrease in kidney function; or, hypertension at least 40 percent disabling under diagnostic code 7101.

A rating of 80 percent is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a when the evidence demonstrates renal dysfunction causing: persistent edema and albuminuria with BUN 40 to 80mg%; or, creatinine 4 to 8mg%; or, generalized poor health characterized by lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion.

A rating of 100 percent is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a when the evidence demonstrates renal dysfunction causing: Requiring regular dialysis, or precluding more than sedentary activity from one of the following: persistent edema and albuminuria; or, BUN more than 80mg%; or, creatinine more than 8mg%; or, markedly decreased function of kidney or other organ systems, especially cardiovascular.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension.

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds that an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension is not warranted.

Initially, the Board notes that in the January 2021 decision on appeal, the AOJ sua sponte found that there had been clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a non-final April 2019 rating decision that continued the Veteran's 60 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension because the February 2019 VA examination clearly demonstrated the criteria to warrant an 80 percent rating. Thus, the April 2019 rating decision was revised to assign an 80 percent rating, and the AOJ separately determined that the increased rating was warranted from December 3, 2018, the date that VA received a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation. As the finding of CUE was made sua sponte and involved a non-final rating decision, and the Appellant specifically indicated in the November 2021 VA Form 10182 that she was disagreeing with the effective date assigned for the increased rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension, the Board finds that the proper issue on appeal is entitlement to an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension.  See generally Young v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 51 (2019) (citing Gomez v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 39, 43 n.1 (2015) (observing that it would be "illogical" for a claimant to "forfeit the right to direct review of a [VA] decision in exchange for review under the much higher scrutiny of a CUE motion"). Thus, as the April 2019 rating decision did not become final, the Appellant need not show the elevated standard of CUE to achieve an earlier effective date if such is warranted, and the Board may review the assigned effective date de novo.

Additionally, the Board acknowledges the recent findings in Westervelt v. Collins, No. 23-0024, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims (Vet. App. Apr. 8, 2025), that the Board was required to address CUE raised sua sponte in a Decision Review Officer (DRO) rating decision, but the Board concludes that such findings are distinguishable from the present case. First, in Westervelt, the Court stated that the CUE issue and the issue on appeal were highly related as both addressed the Veteran's eventually combined ratings for posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Id. Second, the Court stated that the Statement of the Case (SOC) on appeal, clearly discussed and relied on the CUE findings in its own findings regarding the issue on appeal. Id. Lastly, Westervelt, is a legacy case in which the Veteran appealed to Board by submitting a VA Form 9 allowing him to select that he was appealing all issues listed in the SOC. Id. The Board finds that the assigment of an effective date in the present case is not highly related to the CUE found in the April 2019 rating decision, particularly as the RO separately addressed the assignment of an effective date and only made CUE findings narrowly regarding the increased rating rather than the effective date. Moreover, as noted above, in the November 2021 VA Form 10182, the Appellant stated that she was disagreed only with the assigned effective date and did not raise the issue of an increased rating or the issue of CUE, nor has she or the Veteran raised the issue of CUE in any submitted pleadings. Thus, in the present case the Appellant need not show the elevated standard of CUE to achieve an earlier effective date if such is warranted, and the Board may review the assigned effective date de novo.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (38 U.S.C. § 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) created a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019, and the modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019, effective date of the modernized review system. The AMA may also apply to claims where the claimant has elected review of a legacy claim under the modernized review system in VA's test program, the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. A legacy claim is a claim for which VA provided notice of an initial decision prior to the February 19, 2019, effective date of the AMA modernized review system. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2.

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500. In particular, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing an applicable administrative review option following issuance of a decision by an AOJ, the Board, or the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h). When a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options within one year of the issuance of the decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

In the present case, on October 16, 2014, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected hypertension. In an August 2015 rating decision, a rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension was denied. In May 2016, he submitted a Notice of Disagreement in response to the August 2015 rating decision, and in January 2018, the Veteran submitted another NOD selecting the DRO Review Process. In an October 2018 DRO rating decision, the AOJ stated that in response to the May 2016 Notice of Disagreement, service connection for chronic renal disease combined with hypertension was granted, and assigned a 60 percent rating effective from October 16, 2014. The Veteran did not appeal the October 2018 DRO rating decision. 

On December 3, 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0966 Intent to File a Claim for Compensation, which was acknowledged in December 2018 VA correspondence. Subsequently, in January 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation, seeking an increased rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension. In an April 2019 rating decision, the Veteran's 60 percent rating was continued. In July 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking an increased rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension. In a September 2019 rating decision, the rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension was increased to 100 percent effective June 28, 2019. In December 2019, the Veteran again submitted a claim for an increased rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension. In the January 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was found in the April 2019 rating decision that confirmed a 60 percent rating because the February 2019 VA examination showed that an 80 percent rating was warranted. It was determined that an 80 percent rating was warranted based on generalized poor health characterized by weakness. Separately, the AOJ also found that the effective date of this grant is December 3, 2018, the date that the Intent to File a Claim form was received by VA. In the November 2021 VA Form 10182, the Appellant identified the January 2021 rating decision and stated that an effective date of 2014 was warranted for chronic renal disease with hypertension. The Appellant did not disagree with the assigned ratings or raise any argument regarding CUE.

The Board finds that the October 2018 DRO rating decision is a response to the Appellant's initial claim from October 2014, before the AMA took effect, and thus was a denial under the legacy system. The notification letter for the October 2018 DRO rating decision stated that if the Veteran wished to appeal the decision, he was to submit a VA Form 21-0958 Notice of Disagreement, which is consistent with the legacy system. The Veteran did not submit a VA Form 21-0958 within one year of the October 2018 denial. Although the Veteran submitted the December 2018 Intent to File Form within one year of the October 2018 DRO rating decision, because the October 2018 denial was issued under the legacy system and could only be appealed with a VA Form 21-0958, continuous pursuit did not apply.  However, a review of the evidence demonstrates that within one year of the October 2018 DRO rating decision, new and material evidence was received in the form of the February 2019 VA examination regarding chronic renal disease with hypertension, which included the findings that warranted the subsequently granted 80 percent rating, and private treatment records submitted in January 2019. Thus, the October 2018 DRO rating decision remained pending until the matter was re-adjudicated in the April 2019 rating decision, which was subsequently continuously pursued until the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b); Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Therefore, the period presently on appeal stems from the October 2014 claim.  

As noted above, an effective date for increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if the application is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The February 2019 VA examination demonstrated findings that warranted the subsequently granted 80 percent rating. Specifically, the examiner determined that the Veteran's renal dysfunction caused generalized poor health due. Additionally, the private treatment records submitted in January 2019 and dated January 18, 2019, demonstrate that the Veteran had been experiencing generalized weakness and decreased activity for the past 24 hours. A review of the claims file does not demonstrate that prior to the January 2019 private treatment records or February 2019 VA examination, the criteria to warrant an 80 percent rating under DC 7530 were met as the evidence does not show that the Veteran experienced renal dysfunction causing persistent edema and albuminuria with BUN 40 to 80 mg%; or, creatinine 4 to 8 mg%; or, generalized poor health characterized by lethargy, weakness, anorexia, weight loss, or limitation of exertion. Therefore, the Board finds that as it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran experienced an increase in disability prior to the February 2019 VA examination or January 2019 private treatment records, an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, is therefore not warranted. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to an effective date prior to December 3, 2018, for the grant of an 80 percent rating for chronic renal disease with hypertension. Therefore, the appeal is denied.

SMC BASED ON AID & ATTENDANCE

In addition to any benefits already received, a Veteran may also be entitled to SMC benefits where there is an established need for regular aid and attendance. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(b)(3). Requiring aid and attendance means that a person is helplessness or so nearly helpless as to require the regular aid and attendance of another person.

A Veteran will be considered to be in need of regular aid and attendance if by reason of his service-connected disabilities he (1) is blind or so nearly blind as to have corrected visual acuity of 5/200 or less in both eyes, or concentric contraction of the visual field to 5 degrees or less; (2) is a patient in a nursing home because of mental or physical incapacity; or (3) establishes a factual need for aid and attendance under 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.351(b), (c).

The criteria to be considered in establishing a factual need for aid and attendance include:

"	The inability of a claimant to dress or undress herself, or to keep herself ordinarily clean and presentable; 

"	Frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); 

"	Inability of claimant to feed herself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; 

"	Inability to attend to the wants of nature; or, 

"	Incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his daily environment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

Being bedridden is a proper basis for the determination. "Bedridden" is that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that a claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352(a).

It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. Moreover, it is only necessary that the evidence establish that the claimant is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that a claimant is so helpless, as to be in need of regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. Id. 

2. Entitlement to SMC, based on the need for aid and attendance. 

The Board has reviewed the evidence and finds that entitlement to SMC, based on aid and attendance, is not warranted.

The Board notes that prior to his death, the Veteran was awarded service connection for chronic renal disease with hypertension, a bullous condition of the bilateral feet, testicular atrophy with erectile dysfunction, and scar residuals of a burn on the right arm. 

In a VA Form 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance submitted in August 2018, the Veteran was noted as having multiple diagnoses related to his need for assistance including anterior dislocation of right humerus, chronic hypertension with ulcer and inflammation of the right lower extremity, pain in the bilateral knees, gout, muscle weakness, and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety. It was determined that the Veteran required assistance feeding himself, preparing meals, and tending to bathing and hygiene needs.

In a VA Form 21-2680 submitted in February 2019, the Veteran was noted as having multiple diagnoses related to his need for assistance including encephalopathy, dehydration, weakness, acute kidney failure, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, delirium, venous insufficiency non-pressure ulcer, anemia, unspecified cataract chronic kidney glaucoma, inflammatory liver disease, lymphedema, poly-osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, chronic pain, and schizophrenia. It was determined that the Veteran required assistance feeding himself, preparing meals, and tending to bathing and hygiene needs. It was also noted that the Veteran had no cognitive awareness. 

In a VA Form 21-2680 submitted in July 2019, the Veteran was noted as having multiple diagnoses related to his need for assistance including dementia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, venous insufficiency, anemia, a wound, glaucomatous optic atrophy, and sleep apnea. It was determined that the Veteran required assistance feeding himself, preparing meals, and tending to bathing and hygiene needs. It was also noted that the Veteran requires assistance with all activities of daily living due to dementia. 

Lastly, in a VA Form 21-2680 submitted in December 2019, the Veteran was noted as having multiple diagnoses related to his need for assistance including dementia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and an infected left knee due to infected hardware. It was determined that the Veteran required assistance feeding himself, preparing meals, and tending to bathing and hygiene needs. It was specifically noted that the Veteran is unable to prepare his own meals or tend to bathing and hygiene needs due to dementia. 

The Board finds that entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance is not warranted. Although the Board acknowledges that the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran required the regular aid and attendance of another person, this special level of disability is based on his non-service-connected disabilities, most notably his non-service-connected dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Entitlement to SMC is only warranted when a special level of disability is caused by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, and the evaluators repeatedly noted that the Veteran's need for the regular aid and attendance of another person was due to his dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In the present case the basis for the Veteran's special level of disability is not based on a service-connected disability, and the Board finds that entitlement to SMC is therefore not warranted.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim of that entitlement to SMC, based on aid and attendance. Therefore, the appeal in this regard is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
