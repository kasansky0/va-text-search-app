REMANDED

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

Service connection for left ear hearing loss (LHL) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1980 to September 2000. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

The Veteran's October 2022 claims for service connection for OSA and LHL were originally denied in a February 2023 rating decision. In response to the Veteran's February 2023 request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), a June 2023 rating decision returned the claim to the AOJ to correct a duty to assist error. The September 2023 rating decision on appeal here continued the denials of service connection for OSA and LHL.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Although the Veteran retained the ability to change his docket election as of the time of this remand, the Board finds that timely remand, rather than continued delay, benefits the Veteran and will consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Under the AMA, the Board shall remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

1. Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA, asserting that his military occupational specialty (MOS) as an infantryman exposed him to sleep deprivation and insomnia, which caused OSA. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran's daughter submitted a statement indicating the Veteran has snored loudly since she was a child, and she has witnessed him stop breathing in his sleep. See November 2022 Correspondence. 

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran is diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. See June 2023 Rating Decision; September 2024 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Remand is necessary to obtain an adequate VA examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4), 20.802 (a). The Veteran was afforded a February 2023 VA examination and medical opinion and an August 2024 VA medical opinion. The VA examination and opinions are inadequate. Inadequate medical examinations include examinations that contain only data and conclusions, do not provide an etiological opinion, are not based upon a review of medical records, or provide unsupported conclusions. Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). When VA undertakes to examine a Veteran, VA is obligated to ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21. Vet. App. 303 (2007).

The February 2023 VA examination and medical opinion is inadequate. An opinion based on the absence of treatment records without consideration of a Veteran's competent lay statements is inadequate. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 48-49 (2007). Lay evidence does not lack credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The February 2023 examiner concluded OSA is less likely than not the result of the Veteran's sleep issues during service, because the Veteran was not diagnosed with OSA until after service, indicating that the Veteran's reported sleep issues during service "...are a wide variety of considerations with sleep apnea just being one,". See February 2023 VA Examination. The February 2023 examiner did not elicit statements from the Veteran detailing his sleep issues during service and instead relied on the absence of an OSA diagnosis during or immediately after service. Therefore, the February 2023 VA examination and opinion is inadequate. See Dalton, 21 Vet. App. at 48-49; Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

The August 2024 VA examiner provided an inadequate rationale for their opinion that the Veteran's OSA is less likely than not related to an in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). An adequate rationale must discuss the specifics of the Veteran's in-service TERAs to conduct a synergistic, combined effect analysis of the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(2)(B). The examiner did not elicit statements describing the Veteran's in-service duties or experiences as an infantryman that led to TERAs. See August 2024 VA Examination. The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's MOS likely exposed him to chemicals, gun powder, dust, explosions, and the residuals, and that occupational exposure to organic solvents, air pollution, or second-hand smoke might cause OSA, but concluded the Veteran's OSA is less likely related in in-service TERAs and more likely related to the Veteran's risk factors of being male and overweight. Id. Since the Veteran has a history of gaining weight during and after service and has a history of in-service TERAs, an adequate rationale must discuss the specifics of both histories and explain how the examiner determined whether OSA is more likely related to the Veteran's obesity or in-service TERAs. For these reasons, the August 2024 VA medical opinion is inadequate. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(2)(B); see also Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008); Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124 (2007).

Additionally, the February 2023 and August 2024 VA medical opinions did not consider secondary service connection as a theory of entitlement, with obesity as an intermediate step. The Board is required to consider all theories of entitlement that are either raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011). 

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc). 

Obesity cannot be service connected on a direct basis, but it can serve as an intermediate step between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a). A theory of obesity as an intermediate step is raised when there is some evidence in the record which draws an association or suggests a relationship between the Veteran's obesity and service-connected disabilities. See Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241, 248 (2021).

The record raises secondary service connection as a theory of entitlement, with obesity as an intermediate step. The Veteran experiences numerous service-connected disabilities that cause pain and reduce mobility, including right knee patellofemoral syndrome, degenerative arthritis of the spine, left eye stroke, hypertension, bilateral cold injuries of the feet, and bilateral radiculopathy of the lower extremities. See March 2025 Codesheet. Service treatment records (STRs) reflect that the Veteran weighed 136 pounds at enlistment and weighed 185 pounds at separation. See STRs received January 2006; DPRIS Response received July 2023. VA treatment records show the Veteran continued to gain weight after separating from service. See CAPRI received January 2020; CAPRI received October 2022; Medical Treatment Record received February 2023. The February 2023 VA examiner stated the Veteran's current diagnosis of OSA cannot be attributed to the Veteran's sleep problems during service, and the August 2024 VA examiner indicated the Veteran's OSA risk factors of male sex and obesity outweigh the in-service TERAs. See February 2023 VA Examination; August 2024 VA Examination. Thus, the record shows the Veteran has service-connected disabilities that cause pain and limited mobility, the Veteran gained weight during and after service, and the Veteran's obesity is a risk factor for OSA. Therefore, VA must obtain a medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused the Veteran to gain weight and whether the Veteran's OSA is related to this weight gain. 

Given the AOJ's pre-decisional duty to assist errors, remand is necessary to afford the AOJ an opportunity to provide the Veteran with an adequate medical examination and opinion addressing entitlement to service connection for OSA.

2. Service connection for left ear hearing loss (LHL) is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for LHL, asserting that he developed LHL during active duty service as a result of noise exposure, because his MOS exposed him to "...loud noises heard as infantryman including m16, m60 machine gun, 50 caliber machine gun, anti tank weapons, and hand grenades." See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran is diagnosed with LHL, and a qualifying event occurred during service because the Veteran was exposed to excessive noise as an infantryman. See June 2023 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). 

Remand is necessary to obtain an adequate VA examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The Veteran was afforded a December 2022 VA examination and opinion and an August 2024 VA opinion for LHL. The VA examination and opinions are inadequate. When VA undertakes to examine a Veteran, VA is obligated to ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21. Vet. App. 303 (2007).

The December 2022 VA examination and opinion is inadequate. An opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). The December 2022 VA examiner indicated the Veteran's LHL is less likely than not the result of military noise exposure, finding that STRs did not show a permanent positive threshold shift during service. See December 2022 VA Examination. However, a comparison of the September 1980 and March 2000 audiograms shows a positive threshold shift of 5 decibels at the 4000 Hz frequency in the left ear, and a comparison of the September 1980 and August 1999 audiograms reflects positive threshold shifts of 10 decibels for the 4000 and 6000 Hz frequencies in the left ear. See STRs received January 2006. Thus, the opinion's rationale is inconsistent with the Veteran's STRs showing a positive threshold shift occurred during service. The examiner did not acknowledge the positive threshold shifts in the left ear or explain why the threshold shifts do not demonstrate that some degree of hearing loss occurred during service. Therefore, the December 2022 VA examination and opinion is inadequate. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). 

The August 2024 VA opinion is inadequate, because the rationale does not provide an etiological opinion for the Veteran's LHL. See Nieves- Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008); Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124 (2007). The August 2024 VA opinion found LHL is less likely than not related to an in-service TERA. See August 2024 VA Examination. The rationale explained that the Veteran's LHL is associated with noise exposure, not an in-service TERA. Id. The opinion did not address whether the noise exposure responsible for the Veteran's LHL occurred during service or after the Veteran separated from service. Id. The rationale did not acknowledge the June 2023 rating decision's favorable finding that the Veteran's MOS as an infantryman for 19 years and 8 months exposed the Veteran to excessive noise. See DD214. Thus, the August 2024 VA opinion is inadequate. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008); Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124 (2007).

For the above reasons, remand is necessary to afford the AOJ an opportunity to provide the Veteran with an adequate medical examination and opinion addressing entitlement to service connection for LHL. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding treatment records related to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or left ear hearing loss (LHL). 

2. After associating outstanding treatment records related to OSA with the claims file, obtain an addendum medical opinion to ascertain the nature and etiology of OSA. 

The examiner must review the entire claims file and a copy of this Remand, then respond to the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was incurred in or is otherwise related to his active service? Why or why not?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was caused by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities? Why or why not?

(c.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected disabilities? Why or why not? 

(d.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA was caused or aggravated by the Veteran's weight gain?  Why or why not? If this opinion is positive, the examiner shall respond to: 

i.	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused the Veteran's weight gain? Why or why not? 

ii.	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities aggravated the Veteran's weight gain? Why or why not?

(e.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that there is a relationship between the Veteran's OSA and his TERAs? Why or why not?

The examiner must consider the total potential exposure through the Veteran's applicable military deployments, and the synergistic, combined effect of all his TERA.

A complete rationale for any opinion expressed shall be provided. If the examiner determines that one aspect of the Veteran's history - obesity, exposure to chemicals, exposure to gun powder, exposure to dust, or exposure to explosions - is more likely to be related to the Veteran's OSA than another, the rationale must explain how the examiner made that determination.

If the examiner determines another examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, the Veteran will be provided such examination.

3. After associating outstanding treatment records related to LHL with the claims file, obtain an addendum medical opinion to ascertain the nature and etiology of LHL. 

The examiner must review the entire claims file and a copy of this Remand, then respond to the following: 

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was related to exposure to excessive noise during service? Why or why not? 

The examiner must address the positive threshold shifts in the 4000 and 6000 Hz frequencies of the left ear shown by the Veteran's in-service audiograms. If the examiner determines that Veteran's LHL is not related to the noise exposure the Veteran experienced as an infantryman, then the examiner should provide an explanation discussing the etiology of the Veteran's LHL.

If the examiner determines another examination is necessary to provide the requested opinion, the Veteran will be provided such examination.

4. Provide a rationale to support all opinions. In providing the requested opinions, consider the Veteran's lay statements describing in-service and post-service symptoms.

If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this must be noted.
