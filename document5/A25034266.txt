ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's death certificate shows that he was pronounced dead in March 2020, and the immediate causes of death were anoxic encephalopathy due to or as a consequence of bupropion intoxication.

2. At the time of his death, the Veteran was not in receipt of service connection for any disability.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition (DSM-V) and that any specific in-service stressor was alleged.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for cause of death are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154(b), 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304(f), 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from February 2001 to February 2005.  He was the recipient of the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon.  The Veteran died in March 2020.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision by Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), under the modernized review system.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400.  VA received a timely July 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the October 2023 rating decision, selecting the Direct Review Docket.

Of procedural note, in the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that new and relevant evidence was obtained sufficient to readjudicate the appellant's claim for entitlement to service connection for cause of death.  The AOJ's finding that evidence submitted is new and relevant is a favorable finding and binding on the Board.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As such, new and relevant evidence has been received and the Appellant's claim can be readjudicated.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

As the Appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, only the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal may be considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  Evidence received after the AOJ decision will not be considered unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The appellant has not filed such a request.  If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, it will not be considered.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that could not be considered, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death.

The Appellant contends that the Veteran's cause of death was related to service.  Specifically, the Appellant contends the Veteran's death due to prescription medication overdose was caused by his undiagnosed PTSD, which she asserts was incurred in or due to his service.

Applicable Law

A veteran's surviving spouse is eligible for DIC benefits when a qualifying veteran dies from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.5(a).  In order to establish service connection for the cause of the veteran's death, the evidence must show that the service-connected disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (a).  It is the primary cause of death if it was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related to the death; it is a contributory cause if it contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b), (c).  Additionally, it is not sufficient to show that a service-connected disability causally shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (c).  

Compensation shall not be paid if death was the result of a veteran's own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.  38 U.S.C. §§ 105, 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(c).  In order for death by suicide to constitute willful misconduct, the act of self-destruction must be intentional.  A person of unsound mind is incapable of forming an intent (mens rea, or guilty mind, which is an essential element of crime or willful misconduct).  It is a constant requirement for favorable action that the precipitating mental unsoundness be service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.302(a) (2015); Elkins v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 391, 397-98 (1995).

Whether a person, at the time of suicide, was so unsound mentally that he or she did not realize the consequence of such an act, or was unable to resist such impulse is a question to be determined in each individual case, based on all available lay and medical evidence pertaining to his or her mental condition at the time of suicide.  The act of suicide or a bona fide attempt is considered to be evidence of mental unsoundness.  Therefore, where no reasonably adequate motive for suicide is shown by the evidence, the act will be considered to have resulted from mental unsoundness.  A reasonably adequate motive for suicide may be established by affirmative evidence showing circumstances which could lead a rational person to self-destruction.  38 C.F.R. § 3.302.

At the time of his death, the Veteran was not service-connected for a disability.  As such, the Board will address the laws that otherwise govern service connection for a disability.

Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

There are particular requirements for establishing entitlement to service connection for PTSD in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) that are similar, but nonetheless separate, from those for establishing entitlement to service connection generally.  Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  Entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a), conforming to the DSM-V; (2) credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and the in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

The evidence required to support the occurrence of an in-service stressor varies depending on whether the veteran was engaged in combat with the enemy. If the evidence establishes that a veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the claimed stressor is related to that combat, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary and provided that the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such veteran's service, lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to that veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of that veteran's service, a veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).

Analysis

As a preliminary matter, VA death benefits may be paid to a surviving spouse who was married to a veteran for one year or more prior to the veteran's death.  38 U.S.C. § 1102, 1304. 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  The term "surviving spouse" is defined as a person who: (1) was the lawful spouse of a veteran at the time of the  veteran's death; (2) lived with the veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of the veteran's death, except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the veteran without fault of the spouse; and (3) has not remarried.  38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b)(1); Gregory v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 108 (1993); VA O.G.C. Prec. Op. No. 3-2014.  The record indicates the Veteran, and the Appellant did not cohabitate since approximately July 2019, with the Veteran leaving the state to take employment, and continued to not cohabitate upon his return later in 2019 up until his death in March 2020.  See Lay/Witness Statement, August 30, 2023.  However, the separation is found to be due to the misconduct or procured by the Veteran without fault of the spouse.  The separation that occurred in July 2019 was procured by the Veteran by moving out of state without properly consulting with the Appellant. Id.  The continued separation after his return was due to the Veteran's misconduct considering his threatening actions towards his spouse upon his return.  Id.  In conclusion, the Appellant and Veteran are found to have been married at the time of his death and the Appellant has standing to apply for VA death benefits.

Upon review of the evidence, entitlement to service connection for cause of death is not warranted.  The second element required for service connection for PTSD is the need for credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred.  While it is clear from the record that the Veteran was a combat veteran who received the Combat Action Ribbon, no specific allegations of a stressor or of any particular incident that may have caused his anxiety and depression were alleged.  As such, any opinion rendered on whether the appellant's PTSD was due to a stressor would amount to pure speculation.  See Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2009).  The record contains a private examination which diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and opined his PTSD caused his death by suicide.  See Private Medical Opinion, K.G., Ph.D., January 21, 2022.  However, the examination is inadequate.  Entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), conforming to the DSM-V.  The private examiner did not indicate that her diagnosis was in accordance with the DSM-V.  Additionally, a PTSD diagnosis must be diagnosed by a VA clinician.  Finally, considering the lack of a specific stressor alleged, the private clinician engages in speculation as to any connection between the appellant's mental health disabilities and his service.  See Hood, supra.  No other evidence in the record indicates a diagnosis of PTSD or offers a specific allegation of a stressor or incident causing its onset.

As the evidence is insufficient to satisfy the requirements for service connection for PTSD, no other cause of death has been suggested by the record, and the Veteran was not service-connected for any disability, entitlement to service connection for cause of death is not warranted.
