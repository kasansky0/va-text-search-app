ORDER

Entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for specially adapted housing (SAH) is denied.

Entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for a special home adaptation (SHA) grant is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The appellant's service-connected disabilities do not include or result in loss or loss of use of the lower extremities, blindness in both eyes, loss or loss of use of one lower extremity with residual organic disease or injury affecting balance or propulsion, loss or loss of use of one lower extremity with loss or loss of use of one upper extremity affecting balance and propulsion, loss or loss of use of both upper extremities to preclude use of arms at or above the elbow, or full thickness or subdermal burns.

2. The appellant's service-connected disabilities do not result in blindness in both eyes with 5/200 visual acuity or less, involve the anatomical loss of use of both hands, certain deep partial and full thickness or subdermal burns, or residuals of an inhalation injury.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for SAH are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 2101, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.809.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for a SHA grant are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 2101, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.809(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Army from January 1963 to January 1966.  

This appeal has been advanced on the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

These matters come before the Board on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied entitlement to SAH and a SHA grant. In June 2024, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing the March 2024 rating decision to the Board, and requesting a Hearing with a Veterans Law Judge.  In July 2024, the appellant was notified of a Board virtual tele-hearing scheduled for October 3, 2024. See BVA Hearing Scheduled Letter, July 17, 2024. In and October 2024 correspondence, the appellant's representative stated the "claimant wishes to withdraw the request for a BVA hearing." See VA Form 20-10208, October 1, 2024. The Board therefore deems the hearing request withdrawn pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e).

Evidentiary Windows

The Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal, evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative at the Board hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing; and evidence submitted within 90 days following the Board hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a), 302(a).  If the hearing request is withdrawn pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.704(e), the Board's decision will be based on a review of evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's decision on the issue(s) on appeal, and evidence submitted within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and the date the hearing request is withdrawn, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal request.  If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

Entitlement to certificates of eligibility for SAH and SHA are denied.

The appellant contends that he is entitled to a certificate of eligibility for SAH and SHA. See Veterans Application in Acquiring Specially Adapted Housing or Special Home Adaption Grant under Title 38 U.S.C. 2101(a) or (b) (VA Form 26-4555), October 20, 2023; Supplemental Claim Application (VA Form 20-0995), March 12, 2024.

SAH is available to veterans who have a service-connected disability rated as permanent and total due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or one of the following: (1) The loss or loss of use of both lower extremities, such as to preclude locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; (2) Blindness in both eyes, having central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a standard correcting lens; (3) The loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with residuals of organic disease or injury which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; (4) The loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity which so affect the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; (5) The loss or loss of use of both upper extremities such as to preclude use of the arms at or above the elbow; or (6) Full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contractures with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk. 38 U.S.C. § 2101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(a), (b), (d). For the purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), an eye with a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(b)(2)

Preclusion of locomotion means the necessity for regular and constant use of a wheelchair, braces, crutches, or canes as a normal mode of locomotion although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(c),

SAH may also be available to a veteran who served on or after September 11, 2001, who has a permanent disability that was incurred during such service, and which results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair. See 38 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)(C).

If entitlement to SAH is not established, a veteran can qualify for a grant for necessary SHAs if the veteran has a service-connected disability that results in blindness in both eyes with 20/200 visual acuity or less in the better eye with the use of a standard correcting lens or a limitation in fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees; such a disability need not be permanent and total in nature. Additionally, a SHA grant is available for a veteran that has a permanent and total disability which: (1) includes the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands; (2) is due to deep partial thickness burns that have resulted in contracture(s) with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk; (3) is due to full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contracture(s) of one or more extremities or the truck; or, (4) is due to residuals of an inhalation injury (including, but not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). 38 C.F.R. § 3.809a(b).

Generally, an eligible veteran will be provided one-time only assistance with a SHA grant or SAH. However, issuance of a SHA grant before a veteran becomes eligible for SAH under 38 C.F.R. § 3.809 does not preclude a later grant for SAH. 38 C.F.R. § 3.809a(a).

In this instance, the appellant is currently service-connected for PTSD rated as 70 percent disabling, kidney disease rated as 60 percent disabling, diabetes mellitus type II rated as 20 percent disabling, diabetic retinopathy rated as 20 percent disabling, Peyronie's disease rated as 20 percent disabling, lumbar spine disability rated as 20 percent disabling, right lower extremity sciatica rated as 20 percent disabling, right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy rated as 10 percent disabling, and left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy rated as 10 percent disabling. None of these disabilities qualify for SAH or SHA. Additionally, no disability is rated as permanent and total due to or including any of the physical disabilities enumerated above to warrant SAH under 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(a), (b), (d).

With regard to consideration under 38 U.S.C. § 2101(a)(2)(C), which provides entitlement to SAH for veterans who served on or after September 11, 2001 and who have a permanent disability that was incurred during such service, and which results in loss or loss of use of one or more lower extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair; here, the appellant served from January 1963 to January 1966, and thus is not entitled to SAH under these criteria.

Although the appellant is service-connected for a lumbar spine disability and right lower extremity sciatica, these conditions have not been shown to result in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aids of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.

Finally, turning to the issue of entitlement to SHA, although the appellant is service-connected for diabetic retinopathy and bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the appellant's service-connected diabetic retinopathy results in blindness in both eyes with 20/200 visual acuity or less in the better eye with the use of a standard correcting lens or a limitation in fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees; or has a permanent and total disability which includes the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands; is due to deep partial thickness burns that have resulted in contracture(s) with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk; is due to full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contracture(s) of one or more extremities or the trunk; or is due to residuals of an inhalation injury. Therefore, entitlement to a SHA grant is not warranted.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether entitlement to SAH or SHA is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for SAH and/or SHA. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application). As such, the claims are denied.
