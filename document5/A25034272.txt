REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1968 to May 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In a March 2023 decision, the Board denied the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to a TDIU. The Veteran appealed the March 2023 Board decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). In an October 2023 Order, the CAVC vacated the March 2023 Board decision after granting a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR). Per the October 2023 Order, the CAVC then remanded the issue of entitlement to a TDIU back to the Board for readjudication. In December 2023, the Board issued a decision that addressed the reasons for remand in the JMR and then denied the claim of entitlement to a TDIU. The Veteran appealed the December 2023 Board decision to the CAVC. In a December 2024 Order, the CAVC vacated the December 2023 Board decision after granting a JMR. Per the JMR, the parties agreed that the Board relied on Appellant's report in his October 2021 VA Form 21-8940 that he earned $46,800 of income over the 12 months and the Board noted that the amount was "about 3.6 times the poverty threshold in 2021," and was "more than marginal." "However [the parties agreed that] the Board failed to reconcile this evidence with Appellant's other statements in his VA Form 21-8940 that he last worked on December 31, 2014, and had no current income." Thus, the parties agreed that it was "unclear whether Appellant's reported income is consistent with work activity during the relevant period." Consequently, the JMR called for the Board to "adequately address the inconsistencies in the October  2021 VA Form  21-8940, including whether it is necessary to seek clarification from Appellant."

Procedural history relevant to readjudicating this matter follows. In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to a TDIU most recently addressed in a December 2021 rating decision. In June 2022, the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 RO decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

As noted above, in a December 2024 Order, the CAVC vacated the December 2023 Board decision after granting a JMR. Per the JMR, the parties agreed that the Board relied on Appellant's own report, in his October 2021 VA Form 21-8940, that he earned $46,800 of income over the 12 months. However, the Veteran's statement as to his earnings in the last 12 months are inconsistent the Veteran's other statements in the same VA Form 21-8940, namely that he also stated he last worked on December 31, 2014, and had no current income. As a result, the JMR directed the Board to "adequately address the inconsistencies in the October  2021 VA Form 21-8940, including whether  it is necessary to seek clarification from  Appellant. "

After review of the record and the October 2021 VA Form 21-8940, the Board finds that it is unclear whether the Veteran's reported income of $46,800 over the past 12 months is consistent with work activity during the period. As such, the Board finds it necessary to remand the claim for TDIU for clarification of the contents of the October 2021 VA Form 21-8940; this a pre-decisional duty to assist, as it occurred prior to the June 2022 RO decision on appeal. 

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:
