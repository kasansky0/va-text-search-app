ORDER

The request for an extension of time to file an appeal from the July 21, 2023, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) administrative decision that denied reimbursement for medical services provided on January 14, 2022 is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Appellant did not file a timely Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, that denied reimbursement for medical services provided on January 14, 2022, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The July 21, 2023, Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, that denied reimbursement for medical services provided on January 14, 2022, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from January 1992 through January 1997. The Appellant filed a July 21, 2023, Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, and selecting the Evidence docket.

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed Notice of Disagreement (NOD, Board Appeal request) on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of a Board Appeal request shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C).  

An extension of the period for filing Board Appeal request may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c).  

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019). 

Timeliness of the July 21, 2023, Board Appeal request

On July 21, 2023, the Appellant filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, that denied reimbursement for medical services provided on January 14, 2022. The Appellant asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because they first billed Tricare East as a member request and then found it should have been billed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. See July 2023 VA Form 10182. 

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022. 

The VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, denied reimbursement for medical services provided to the Veteran on January 14, 2022, because the time limit for filing a claim for reimbursement period pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1725 had expired. The administrative decision, or Explanation of Payment (EOP), stated that appeals must be received within one year of the date of the EOP and referred the Appellant to a website with information on where to send the appeal. A Customer Service hotline phone number was also provided. The EOP notification was sent to the Appellant's address and was not returned to sender. 

The Appellant's July 21, 2023, Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022. 

As noted above, in the July 2023 VA Form 10182, the Appellant asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because the claim for reimbursement was first submitted to Tricare East by mistake. It was later submitted to VA, but it was past the time to file by then. The Board acknowledges the Appellant's argument that the claim was first to the wrong entity first, and that this initial incorrect submission caused the subsequent filing of the claim with VA to be untimely. However, these assertions do not explain why the Board Appeal request was not timely filed within one year of the June 10, 2022, VHA administrative decision, nor why it could not have been filed earlier than it was. 

Accordingly, the July 21, 2023, Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the VHA administrative decision issued on June 10, 2022, that denied reimbursement for medical services provided on January 14, 2022, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
