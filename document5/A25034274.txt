ORDER

A total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Service connection has been established for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood rated 70 percent disabling; left knee strain, effusion, partial meniscectomy residuals, degenerative joint disease, and limitation of extension rated 30 percent disabling; left knee strain, effusion, partial meniscectomy residuals, degenerative joint disease, and instability rated 10 percent disabling; tinnitus rated 10 percent disabling; and a painful left knee medial scar rated 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran has a combined 90 percent service connected rating.

2. In his April 2023 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he had last worked on a full-time basis in February 2021 as a postmaster.

3. The service-connected disabilities are of such severity to preclude the Veteran from securing and following substantially gainful employment.

4. Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is established.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

2. The criteria for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are met.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 1986 to April 1994.  He had additional duty with the Army Reserve.

In September 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied a TDIU.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

TDIU

The Veteran asserts that a TDIU is warranted as the service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to secure and follow any form of substantially gainful employment.

Total ratings for compensation purposes may be assigned where the combined schedular rating for the service-connected disabilities is less than 100 percent when it is found that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to make the veteran unemployable without regard to either advancing age or the presence of any nonservice connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341.

Total ratings for compensation purposes are assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service connected disabilities.  If there are two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability must bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  The existence or degree of nonservice connected disabilities or previous unemployability status will be disregarded where the percentages for the service-connected disability or disabilities are met and in the judgment of the rating agency such service-connected disabilities render the veteran unemployable.  Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Service connection has been established for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood rated 70 percent disabling; left knee strain, effusion, partial meniscectomy residuals, degenerative joint disease, and limitation of extension rated 30 percent disabling; left knee strain, effusion, partial meniscectomy residuals, degenerative joint disease, and instability rated 10 percent disabling; tinnitus rated 10 percent disabling; and a painful left knee medial scar rated 10 percent disabling.  The Veteran has a combined 90 percent service connected rating.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for consideration of the assignment of a TDIU.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In his April 2023 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he last worked on a full-time basis in February 2021 as a postmaster.

An April 2023 evaluation from M. Bucci, PA-C, concludes that "due to [the Veteran's] current level of disablement related to depressive disorder due to a medical condition with depressive features and anxious distress, postoperative residuals of partial meniscectomy and degenerative joint disease of the left knee, left knee medical scar, tinnitus, and left knee scar, as well as the physical, psychological, and cognitive disabilities which are chronic and progressive in nature, [the Veteran] is not capable of performing substantially gainful employment presently, nor in the future in his usual vocation; nor is the Veteran capable of full time work within other vocations." 

The report of a July 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) psychiatric examination states that the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The examiner indicated that "the Veteran's mental health issues do not appear to significantly impair his functioning in a work environment."  The examiner commented that "[the Veteran] reports extremely mild mental health symptoms, and he reports leaving his work at the post office due to physical pain rather than mental health concerns."

The report of a July 2023 VA knee examination states that the Veteran was diagnosed with left knee strain; meniscal tear; instability; degenerative arthritis, other than posttraumatic; and effusion.  The examiner commented that "the functional impact of the claimed condition on social and occupation tasks is reduced."

The record is in at least equipoise as to whether the service-connected disabilities render the Veteran unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment during the relevant period.  The Veteran met the schedular criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) for consideration of a TDIU.  The Veteran reported that he last worked on a full-time basis in February 2021 as a postmaster.  Mr. Bucci determined that the service-connected disabilities rendered the Veteran not capable of performing substantially gainful employment.   Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Board has considered whether special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is warranted.  Entitlement to a TDIU based on the combined impact of the service-connected disabilities has been established.  The Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent or a TDIU due to a single disability and an additional service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability.  Therefore, an award of special monthly compensation at the housebound rate is not for assignment.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Basic Eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance Benefits

Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits exists where a Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and has a permanent and total service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.  The Board has granted a TDIU.  Basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is therefore established.
