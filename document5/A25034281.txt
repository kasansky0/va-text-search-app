ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his right knee disability is etiologically related to an in-service injury.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for right knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1976 to October 1977. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2023. In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the hearing docket.

The Veteran was afforded a Board hearing in December 2024. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for residuals of total knee replacement, right knee, including as secondary to service-connected left knee strain with meniscal tear and limitation of extension.

The Veteran contends that his current right knee condition is secondary to his left knee condition. See December 2024 Board hearing transcript. 

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his orthopedist has told him numerous times that part of the reason his right knee was "turned out" is because he was "babying it because of the left knee pain." Additionally, the Veteran testified that he favored his right knee because it was hard for him to walk on his left knee. Thereafter, he had a total knee replacement. 

Service treatment records show the Veteran was seen for a right knee injury in February 1976. He was unable to walk. The physical examination revealed a right antalgic gait with flexion contracture, effusion, crepitus, and tenderness. The examiner noted an impression of right knee effusion. 

The Veteran's post-service treatment records show he sought treatment for right knee pain in November 2016. X-rays were completed on the right knee in May 2019 and January 2022. The May 2019 x-ray showed mild osteoarthritis. The January 2022 x-ray of the right knee with weightbearing view showed no fracture or dislocation. The Veteran underwent a total knee arthroplasty in January 2022. 

In August 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for the right knee. The examiner opined it was less likely than not that the claimed condition is due to service as there is scant data supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of right knee effusion and military service. The examiner explained that the Veteran had an acute right knee effusion in 1976, while in service, and there was no chronicity of a right knee problem until 34 years later in 2010.

In an August 2022 Knee and Lower Leg Conditions Questionnaire, the examiner described the Veteran's right knee contributing factors as less movement than normal and decreased range of motion. 

In a November 2022 requested VA medical opinion, the examiner rationalized that the Veteran's record review does not substantiate any specific or unique right knee injury which the Veteran suffered as a result of his service-connected left knee impairments or worsening of the Veteran's right knee impairment secondary to his left knee service-connected impairments. 

In December 2024, the Veteran obtained a private medical opinion stating that his right knee condition is more likely than not related to an injury, disease, or event occurring during the Veteran's military service. The treating physician maintained that the Veteran's right knee replacement has continued chronic pain and decreased his ability to ambulate, which has led to decreased function and a need for an electric chair. 

There is unfavorable medical opinion evidence against the claim and favorable medical opinion evidence in favor of the claim. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his right knee disability is etiologically related to an in-service injury. Accordingly, service connection for right knee disability is warranted.
