REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1972 to September 1973.

This appeal stems from an August 2022 higher-level review decision.  In the August 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU based on a single disability for the purpose of establish entitlement to SMC on a schedular housebound basis under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) is granted.

The Veteran argues that-as part of the issue of the PTSD rating on appeal-he is entitled to a TDIU based on his service-connected PTSD alone, which would entitle him to SMC on a schedular housebound basis.

If the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, the Veteran is entitled to SMC at the housebound rate. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). A TDIU rating based on a single service-connected disability can satisfy the "disability rated as total" criterion for this award. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). When the claimant has been awarded a TDIU, VA must assess whether any combination of those disabilities would establish eligibility for compensation under section 1114(s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 243 (2011).

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. 

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table). 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and nonexertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination that is specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., the veteran's work history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities are PTSD with a 70% rating, obstructive sleep apnea with a 50% rating, cirrhosis of the liver with a 40% rating, a right-hand painful scar with a 10% rating, and three non-compensable disabilities. See February 2025 Codesheet. He also receives a TDIU. Therefore, if the Board finds that his PTSD alone warrants a TDIU, the Veteran will be eligible for SMC under section 1114(s).

A March 2021 VA employability opinion states that the Veteran's PTSD causes no job-related difficulties. In a separate March 2021 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ), the same examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A May 2021 VA medical opinion states that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, including work. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD does not cause total occupational impairment.

A May 2022 private vocational consultant opined that the Veteran's PTSD precludes his ability to secure and follow substantially gainful employment. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's intrusive thoughts, nightmares, mild memory loss, hypervigilance, and disturbances of motivation and mood would likely preclude his ability to meet employer expectations of adequate pace and productivity. The Veteran's low frustration tolerance and irritability would preclude appropriate behavior in the work environment.

The Board finds that the May 2022 private vocational opinion is highly persuasive. The examiner's rationale is comprehensive, understandable, and supported by the record. On the other hand, the March 2021 opinion is less persuasive. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD would cause occupational impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, but she also opined that the PTSD would cause no occupational difficulties. The Board finds that the examiner did not provide sufficient rationale to support these apparently divergent conclusions. The Board further finds that, although the May 2021 examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD does not cause "total" occupational impairment, the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU do not require total occupational impairment. Further, the May 2021 examiner's opinion does not conflict with the opinion that the Veteran cannot secure and maintain substantially gainful employment. Therefore, the Board will resolve reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that he is entitled to a TDIU solely due to his service-connected PTSD for the purpose of entitlement to SMC under section 1114(s).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's attorney asserts that he is entitled to a March 2018 effective date for the award of entitlement to a TDIU based on a single disability for the purpose of establishing entitlement to SMC. However, because the AOJ did not grant this entitlement, it has never assigned an effective date. The Board finds that the effective date for this grant is a downstream element that the AOJ must address in the first instance. See Urban v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 143, 145 (2004); Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 396, 399 (1999) (describing the assignment of an effective date for the award of a TDIU as a downstream issue). 

2. Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 70 percent for PTSD is denied.

The Veteran appeals the 70 percent disability rating for his service-connected PTSD, which is effective from May 2021. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994) ("Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern."). The AOJ rated the Veteran's PTSD under Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411. The 70 percent rating criteria are:

Occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. The 100 percent rating criteria are:

Total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self of others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or name.

Id. The rating criteria contemplate the effects of medication. Id. ("symptoms controlled by continuous medication"); see McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 272 (2016). A claimant "may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). "Although the veteran's symptomatology is the primary consideration, the regulation also requires an ultimate factual conclusion as to the veteran's level of impairment." Id. at 117-118; see Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 18 (2017) (Section 4.130 requires the "symptoms [to] have caused the level of occupational and social impairment associated with a particular disability evaluation"). 

"When there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned." 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

An April 2021 VA psychiatric follow-up says that the Veteran reported that he was "ok," that his mood had been up and down, and that he had a low of stressors. He stated that he did not have much of a social life and did not get along well with his wife. He reported forgetfulness and tiredness. The examiner noted no evidence of paranoia or delusions.

The May 2021 examination report states that the Veteran has been married for 22 years, and he and his wife have been caring for their grandson for 12 years. He and his wife argue daily. The Veteran stated that he does not like leaving his home, does not have friends, and feels uneasy socializing. When he worked, he had difficulty getting along with other employees and supervisors. He reported that he feels nervous often and does not like confined spaces. He is irritable, has a bad temper, and is forgetful. The examiner opined that the Veteran has recurrent memories and dreams, dissociative reactions, intense distress at exposure to cues related to his PTSD stressor, and marked physiological reactions to cues related to his PTSD stressor. The Veteran experiences avoidance negative beliefs, negative emotions, diminished interests, feelings of attachments, and a persistent inability to experience positive emotions. He has irritable behavior and angry outbursts, hypervigilance, reckless or self-destructive behavior, exaggerated startle response, problems with concentration, and sleep disturbance. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms are depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, flattened affect, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence. The examiner observed that the Veteran was appropriately dressed and groomed, suspicious, anxious, and agitated. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

The April 2022 private vocational opinion states that the Veteran's PTSD would preclude him from securing and obtaining substantially gainful employment.

A June 2022 examination report states that the Veteran continued to be married and was raising his grandson. He and his wife had "ups and downs," and he had one physical altercation with his grandson. However, he was determined not to give up on his grandson. He lives next door to his brothers and often visits his sister in the hospital. He often talks to another sister, and he occasionally visits his nephew. He does not attend any community activities. The examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms were depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once per week, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of long- and short-term memory, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, impaired impulse control, and neglect of personal appearance and hygiene. The Veteran reported that sometimes he does not shower for two or three days, although he displayed adequate hygiene during the examination. The Veteran's thought processes were linear and goal directed. The examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. The examiner also noted that the Veteran had recently been treated for worsening mood, anxiety attacks, and suicidal thoughts.

The Board finds that the evidence does not support a total rating for PTSD. First, the Board finds that the May 2021 and June 2022 examiners' opinions that the Veteran's PTSD causes occupational and social impairment in most areas, but not total occupational and social impairment, to be highly persuasive. Both examiners personally evaluated the Veteran, so they were able to observe his affect and mood, they discussed his relevant symptoms, and they provided opinions regarding his symptoms in terms that are consistent with the rating schedule. 

Second, the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's has symptoms listed in or that are similar in severity to those that are listed in the 100 percent rating criteria, such as hallucinations, the inability to perform activities of daily living, gross impairment in thought processes or communications, a persistent danger of hurting self or others, a disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411. The Board also observes that the symptoms in the rating schedule are not exhaustive. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 440-441 (2002). However, the Board finds that none of the Veteran's symptoms are similar in severity to those contemplated by the total disability rating criteria, even if they are not specifically listed in DC 9411's rating criteria. In that regard, the Board recognizes that there is evidence that the Veteran has reckless or self-destructive behavior and irritable and angry outbursts expressed by physical aggression toward people or objects. The Board finds that, when the evidence is read as a whole, these symptoms are more like impaired impulse control with periods of violence than to grossly inappropriate behaviour or being a persistent danger of hurting himself or others. The Board also finds that the Veteran's grooming deficits amount to a neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, which his 70 percent rating contemplates.

Third, the Board observes that the April 2022 private vocational examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD precludes him from securing and following substantially gainful employment. This is a lower standard than total occupational impairment, and the Board finds that this opinion is not sufficient find that the Veteran's PTSD warrants a 100 percent rating. See Roberson, 251 F.3d at 1385.

Fourth, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's PTSD does not cause total social impairment. Although the Veteran has difficulty in his relationships with his wife and grandson, he nevertheless can maintain them. The evidence also demonstrates that he maintains relationships with two sisters and a nephew. Therefore, although the Veteran has deficiencies in his ability to maintain relationships, he does not have total social impairment.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a 100 percent rating for PTSD, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeal is denied.

3. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for ED is denied.

The Veteran appeals the non-compensable rating for his ED. 

The Secretary amended the rating criteria for ED while this appeal was pending. See 86 Fed. Reg. 54081 (September 30, 2021) (final rule effective November 14, 2021). If a law or regulation changes during a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, although the Secretary cannot apply the new version prior to its effective date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the new version's effective date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Kuzma, 341 F. 3d at 1327. 

The current rating criteria provide a non-compensable rating for ED, both with and without penile deformity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, DC 7522 (2022). 

Prior to November 14, 2021, ED was an unlisted condition that the Secretary rated by analogy. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. The AOJ rated the Veteran's ED under hyphenated DC 7599-7522. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.27, 4.115b, DC 7522 (2021) (penile deformity). Under the old criteria, a 20 percent rating was warranted for a penis deformity with loss of erectile power. Id. A non-compensable rating is warranted when the Veteran's ED does not satisfy the requirements for a compensable rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

A December 2018 examination report states that the Veteran has ED that he treats with Viagra. The Veteran declined a physical examination. The examiner opined that the Veteran's ED has no functional impact on his ability to work.

A February 2021 medical opinion states that the Veteran's ED causes no restrictions to job activities.

An April 2021 examination report states that the Veteran has ED that he treats with Viagra. He stated that the medication was helping. The physical examination was normal.

A May 2022 examination report states that the Veteran continued to have ED. The Veteran declined a physical examination.

There is no compensable rating under the new rating criteria. Therefore, the Board will focus its analysis on the old rating criteria.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran has ED that he treats with medication. Per the April 2021 examination report, his penis is normal and not deformed. His ED does not cause any functional impairment to earning capacity. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability does not satisfy the criteria for a 20 percent rating under the former DC 7522. See DC 7599-7522. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.27, 4.115b, DC 7522 (2021).

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran takes medication for his ED. However, there is no evidence that the medication ameliorates a penis deformity. Indeed, the April 2021 medical report states that the medication helps with penetration and ejaculation, not deformity. Therefore, the Board finds that even after discounting the ameliorative effects of the Veteran's medication, he is not entitled to a higher disability rating.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a higher rating for ED, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

3. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for the evaluation of a painful right-hand scar is denied.

The Veteran appeals the 10 percent rating for his painful right-hand scar, which the AOJ rated under DC 7804. This DC provides a 10 percent rating for one or two scars that are unstable or painful, a 20 percent rating for three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804. "An unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is a frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar." Id. at Note (1). "If one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars." Id. at Note (2).

A December 2018 examination report states that the Veteran has one scar on this right hand that he describes as achy or painful. The scar was not unstable. 

A February 2021 medical opinion states that the Veteran's right-hand scar does not cause any restrictions to job activities.

An April 2021 medical examination report states that the Veteran has a well healed scar on his right hand between the second and third fingers. The examiner found that the scar is not painful or unstable. The examiner commented that, although the scar was not painful, it was numb.

In an August 2021 statement, the Veteran stated that his right-hand scar pain is 9 or 10 out of 10 without medicine, and it is a 7 or 8 out of 10 with medicine. He stated that sometimes medicine does not work.

A September 2021 examination report states that the Veteran has one painful scar on his right hand. The examiner found that the scar is not unstable.

A May 2022 examination report states that the Veteran's right-hand scar is not painful or unstable.

After carefully reviewing the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran has one scar on his right hand that is painful. Although the Veteran does get some pain relief from medicine, the Board has discounted those effects and considers his scar pain to be 9 or 10 out of 10. The Veteran does not have three painful scars, which the 20 percent rating criteria require. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804. There is also no evidence that the scar is unstable, so a higher rating for pain and instability is not warranted. Id. at Note (2). Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a rating greater than 10 percent for a painful right-hand scar, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

4. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for a right-hand scar is denied.

The Veteran appeals the noncompensable rating for his right-hand scar, which the AOJ rated under DC 7802. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802. Under this DC, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there is a scar or multiple scars with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. There are no higher ratings. If the scar does not satisfy the requirement for a compensable rating, a non-compensable rating is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

A December 2018 examination report states that the Veteran's right-hand scar is 4.5 by 0.1 cm. 

A February 2021 medical opinion states that the Veteran's right-hand scar does not cause any restrictions to job activities.

An April 2021 examination report states that the Veteran's right-hand scar is 4 by 0.2 cm. The total approximate area is 0.8 cm2. There was no underlying tissue damage.

A September 2021 examination report states that the Veteran's right-hand scar is 3.5 by 0.1 cm. The scar was tender to palpation, but there was no underlying tissue damage.

The May 2022 examiner found that the Veteran's right-hand scar is 4.5 by 0.1 cm.

The evidence demonstrates that the examiners have measured the Veteran's scar to be 3.5 to 4.5 cm by 0.1 to 0.2 cm. This means that the scar is, at the very largest, 4.5 by 0.2 cm, or 0.9 cm2. This area is less than 929 cm2 and does not satisfy the criteria for a compensable rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7802. There is no underlying tissue soft damage. Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim for a compensable rating for a right-hand scar, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-782. Therefore, the appeal is denied. 

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 29, 2018, for the grant of service connection for cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C is denied.

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 29, 2018, for the grant of a TDIU is denied.

7. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 29, 2018, for the grant of eligibility for DEA is denied.

The Veteran appeals the effective date for the grants of service connection for cirrhosis of the liver and hepatitis C, TIDU, and eligibility for DEA. In an August 12, 2022, letter, the Veteran's attorney argued that VA received the Veteran's intent to file on March 29, 2018. See August 2022 Letter.

In general, the effective date for the award of service-connected compensation is the "date of receipt of the claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i); see 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). For awards of increased compensation, the effective date is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability occurred if the claim is filed within one year of that date. Id. § 3.400(o)(2). Otherwise, the effective date is the date that the Secretary received the claim.  Id.

For purposes of entitlement to DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, basic eligibility exists if, among other things, a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021. Therefore, the effective date for DEA eligibility is derivative of the effective date for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD because that is the date on which he is considered permanently and totally disabled due to his service-connected disabilities.

The Veteran submitted his intent to file on March 29, 2018. The Board has carefully reviewed the record, and the Board can discern no document that can be construed as a claim of entitlement to service connection for cirrhosis of the liver prior to that date. The AOJ granted entitlement to a March 29, 2018, effective date for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU based on the effective date for the award of service connection for cirrhosis of the liver. See August 2022 Rating Decision. The effective date for a TDIU cannot be earlier than the effective date for the award of service connection for the disability or disabilities upon which it is based. See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 248 (2019). Further, the Board notes that the Veteran's attorney specifically argued that March 19, 2018, was the proper effective date for the award of a TDIU. See August 2022 Letter. Lastly, because the effective date for DEA eligibility is derivative of the Veteran's TDIU rating, the Veteran is also not entitled to an earlier effective date for DEA eligibility. Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims for an effective date prior to March 29, 2018, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for cirrhosis of the liver, TDIU, and eligibility for DEA benefits, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeals are denied.
