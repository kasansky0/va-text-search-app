REMANDED

Service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 2010 to September 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.  

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a right knee disability in March 2022, but a July 2022 rating decision denied the claim. See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2022 Rating Decision. A January 2023 supplemental claim appealed the July 2022 rating decision, and a January 2023 rating decision stated that new and relevant evidence had not been received, but the AOJ implicitly found new and relevant evidence had been received by readjudicating the claim fully on the merits. See January 2023 VA Form 20-0995; January 2023 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by the implicit finding that sufficient evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims on the merits and need not address whether new and relevant evidence has been received in connection to the January 2023 supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c). In June 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review (HLR) of the January 2023 rating decision. See June 2023 VA Form 20-0996. A July 2023 rating decision did not identify an error on HLR and continued the denial of service connection for a right knee disability. See July 2023 Rating Decision. 

An August 2023 supplemental claim appealed the July 2023 rating decision, but a September 18, 2023 rating decision found that new and relevant evidence had not been received. See August 2023 VA Form 20-0995; September 18, 2023 Rating Decision. On September 23, 2023, the Veteran requested HLR of the September 18, 2023 rating decision, but a September 26, 2023 rating decision did not identify an error on HLR and continued the denial of service connection for a right knee disability. See September 23, 2023 VA Form 20-0996; September 26, 2023 Rating Decision. The September 26, 2023 rating decision found new and relevant evidence had been received, so the Board need not address whether new and relevant evidence has been received in connection to the August 2023 supplemental claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 18, 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Under the AMA, the Board shall remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the claimant under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Service connection for right knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right knee disability, asserting his right knee pain and stiffness began in service. See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; January 2023 VA Form 20-0995; June 2023 VA Form 20-0996; August 2023 VA Form 20-0995; September 2023 VA Form 20-0996; September 2024 VA Form 10182. 

Remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The AOJ did not attempt to obtain the Veteran's treatment records. The AOJ must obtain records in the custody of a federal department and must make reasonable efforts to obtain records not in the custody of a federal department. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(1), (2). The Veteran reported that he has received treatment from medical providers for right knee pain and stiffness, including physical therapy, cryogenic therapy, and chiropractic visits. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138. The Veteran's January 2023 lay statements do not indicate whether the Veteran received medical treatment for his right knee disability from VA or from a private medical provider, but the claims file does not reflect any attempts to send the Veteran correspondence requesting that information. Thus, the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by not attempting to obtain the Veteran's relevant treatment records. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159 (c)(1), (2).

The AOJ did not provide the Veteran with a medical examination and opinion. VA must provide a medical examination or opinion when there is: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence establishing an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the current disability may be related to service; and (4) insufficient medical evidence to decide the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination or medical opinion for his asserted right knee disability, but the low threshold for requiring a VA medical examination or opinion had been triggered at the time of the rating decision on appeal. Id. 

There is competent evidence establishing that the Veteran currently experiences a right knee disability. Pain resulting in functional impairment of earning capacity, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, can constitute a disability. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Veteran stated that he began experiencing right knee pain and stiffness during service and has continued to experience right knee pain and stiffness ever since he separated form service. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138; see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994) (holding that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection). 

There is also competent evidence establishing an injury in service and an indication that the Veteran's right knee disability may be related to service. The Veteran contends his knee pain onset during service in 2011, as a result of extended ruck marches, parachute operations, aircraft repelling, swimming exercises, martial arts programs, obstacle courses, and annual fitness testing. See January 2023 VA Form 21-4138; see also Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469. Since the record does not contain a medical opinion addressing whether the Veteran's current right knee disability is related to the Veteran's asserted in-service injury, there is insufficient evidence to decide the claim.

Therefore, the low threshold for requiring a VA medical examination or opinion had been triggered at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). Remand is therefore necessary to remedy this pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain a VA examination and medical opinion determining the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right knee disability.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the Veteran to determine if there are any relevant, outstanding private treatment records, including any private treatment records from S.A., and attempt to obtain a copy of those records from each private treatment provider and/or facility identified by the Veteran.

2. After associating any additional treatment records relevant to the Veteran's claims for entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability, schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's left knee disability. Following a review of the claims file: 

(a.) The examiner must identify whether the Veteran has a diagnosis to account for his right knee disability. If a diagnosis cannot be provided but the Veteran's right knee disability causes functional impairment, then the examiner should consider them a "disability" for the purpose of providing the requested opinions below.

(b.) Is the Veteran's right knee disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service? Why or why not?
