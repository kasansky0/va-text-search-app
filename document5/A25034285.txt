REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee osteoarthritis is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee strain is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 1977 to March 1978.

The Veteran's left knee claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2020 higher level review decision, following a May 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). As to the right knee, the matter comes before the Board from a September 2020 rating decision by the AOJ.

In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, for the left knee disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  As to the right knee disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 rating decision, and also evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of left knee osteoarthritis, right knee strain, and TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Evaluation of left knee osteoarthritis

The Veteran seeks an increased rating for his left knee osteoarthritis asserting that he experiences instability and frequent falls due to his left knee disability. September 2021 appellate brief; June 2021 Notice of Disagreement. According to the Veteran, his lay statements regarding the instability are sufficient to support a rating of 30 percent for left knee instability. September 2021 appellate brief.

The Veteran's osteoarthritis, left knee, is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, as diagnostic code (DC) 5010-5260. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 (2021). In that regard, DC 5010, for osteoarthritis of the knee, directs that ratings should be assigned based on limitation of motion for the specific joint or joints involved. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5010. 

Under DC 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, diagnostic code 5260. A 10 percent rating may also be assigned for the knee joint if there is painful motion without compensable limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5010; see also Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-06 (1995).

Ratings may be assigned separately for knee instability or subluxation under Diagnostic Code 5257. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Such other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for the disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 113 (2017). 

The Veteran was rated for noncompensable, but painful, limitation of motion of the left knee, effective March 18, 2013. See July 2020 higher level review decision; May 2020 rating decision. The July 2020 higher level review decision specifically noted that the March 2019 examiner found no evidence of instability. 

The Veteran does not argue that his left knee disability has compensable limitation of motion under DC 5260. Rather, he contends that he is entitled to a separate rating for instability. September 2021 appellate brief. In a September 2021 lay statement submitted in support of his appeal, the Veteran stated that his left knee disability causes severe pain, frequent falls, and difficulty in walking longer distances.  According to the Veteran, four or five times a month, his knee will suddenly not support weight and will give out without warning. Although the Veteran stated that he usually manages to grab something to prevent himself from fully falling, he also said that he falls to the ground once or twice a month and then is unable to get back up because of the pain in his knee if there is no one around to assist him. 

Additionally, in the September 2021 statement, the Veteran stated that he uses a cane to prevent falls if must walk a lot, that he uses store-provided buggies to get around large stores, and that he must hold tight to railings when climbing or descending stairs. The Veteran explained that he rests his knee and rubs the knee when the pain flares up, as well as taking over the counter medications but that they did not help much. According to the Veteran, he did not seek treatment because he was unable to drive himself, and it was therefore difficult for him to get to appointments.

The Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms, such as joint pain and buckling. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). As the Veteran argues in his September 2021 brief, objective medical evidence of pain or joint instability is not required, and objective medical evidence is not categorically more probative than lay evidence. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 349 (2018). In this matter, however, the 2021 lay evidence is unsupported by other evidence in the record, including other lay evidence.

Notably, a January 2020 lay statement regarding the Veteran's knee disabilities was silent regarding instability. Rather, in the statement, the Veteran reported that it was difficult for him to work at his job as a milk stocker because his job involved lifting milk crates, bending, and squatting in cold environments which caused him a large amount of pain. He stated that he was let go from his job because his employers saw him frequently hobbling and limping due to the pain in his knees and because he missed many days of work due to the pain.

Additionally, although the Veteran reported left knee instability in the March 2019 VA examination, the Veteran did not report symptoms such as those set out in his September 2021 lay statement or attribute the use of assistive technology to the left knee instability. Specifically, the Veteran reported simply left knee instability and then stated that his right knee disability sometimes required him to use a cane, walker, or even crutches, because he could not put any pressure on the knee. 

A May 2018 VA treatment record filed in January 2019, however, reflects that the Veteran reported left knee instability to his care providers in May 2018 and stated that the knee would give out if he moved too quickly. The Veteran stated at the time that the instability had caused him to fall once two months previously.

Because the Veteran's lay statement is inconsistent with other evidence in the record, including the Veteran's January 2020 lay statement and his statements in the March 2019 VA examination, the evidence is insufficient to grant the claim for an increased rating for left knee osteoarthritis, in the form of a separate rating for left knee instability. 

However, the March 2019 VA examination is also inadequate for adjudication of the evaluation of left knee osteoarthritis. The March 2019 VA examiner failed to report the history of left knee instability reflected in VA treatment records in stating there was no history of instability and failed to address the Veteran's report of current instability in the March 2019 VA examination. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2006). VA's failure to obtain an examination adequate to permit adjudication of the Veteran's claim constituted a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). A remand is necessary, therefore, to provide the Veteran with a VA medical opinion to cure the defects prior to adjudicating the claim on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

2. Evaluation of right knee strain

The Veteran also challenged the 10 percent disability rating for right knee strain. June 2021 Notice of Disagreement. The Veteran's right knee is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5260. As with the left knee, the AOJ determined that the Veteran's limitation of motion for the right knee is noncompensable, but he experiences painful motion, warranting a 10 percent disability rating under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.59. See July 2020 rating decision; Burton, 25 Vet. App. 1; Deluca, 8 Vet. App. at 205-06.

Because the Veteran's right knee disability is related to his left knee disability as stated in the September 2020 rating decision, and because the March 2019 VA examination also reflects potential right knee instability, the Veteran's right knee disability is inextricably intertwined with the claim for an increased rating for the left knee. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991). The right knee disability evaluation, therefore, will also be remanded.

3. Entitlement to TDIU

In July 2011, the Veteran sought TDIU based on medical disability, citing his gout and his knee disabilities. In the January 2020 lay statement, the Veteran described how his disabilities had made working difficult for him and his termination from employment because of those disabilities. In September 2021, the Veteran filed both a second formal application for TDIU and a lay statement ascribing his inability to obtain and maintain employment to his bilateral knee disabilities. Because the Veteran attributes an inability to work to his service-connected right and left knee disabilities, the claim for a TDIU is inextricably intertwined with the claims for increased ratings for each of the knee disabilities. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991); 38 C.F.R. 3.310. The issue of TDIU will be remanded as well.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of his service-connected left and right knee disabilities. The examiner must read this decision and order of remand.

2. The examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria, to include instability of either or both of the left or right knee.

3. In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's descriptions of the disability and its development, including the onset of instability in the left or right knee. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported symptoms represented the onset or aggravation of his current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or otherwise implausible?
