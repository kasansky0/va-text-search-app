ORDER

The reduction of the rating for evaluation right shoulder strain with impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendonitis and glenohumeral joint arthritis (dominant) (hereinafter right shoulder condition) from 40 percent disabling to 20 percent disabling, effective November 1, 2024, was not proper; the 40 percent rating is restored effective November 1, 2024. 

FINDING OF FACT

1.  In an August 2024 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) reduced the Veteran's 40 percent rating for his service-connected right shoulder condition to 20 percent, effective November 1, 2024.

2.  The reduction of the Veteran's right shoulder condition was not carried out in accordance with applicable procedures.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The reduction of the rating for a right shoulder condition from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective November 1, 2024, was not proper.  38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5010-5201.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from October 1992 to July 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which reduced the Veteran's evaluation of right shoulder strain with impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendonitis and glenohumeral joint arthritis (dominant), from 40 percent disabling to 20 percent effective November 1, 2024.

The Veteran timely appealed the August 2024 rating decision to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 and requesting the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review Lane for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the August 2024 rating decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307.  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the August 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

The reduction of the rating for evaluation right shoulder strain with impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendonitis and glenohumeral joint arthritis (dominant) (hereinafter right shoulder condition) from 40 percent disabling to 20 percent disabling, effective November 1, 2024, was not proper; the 40 percent rating is restored effective November 1, 2024. 

The Veteran has challenged the propriety of the reduction of his right shoulder condition, from 40 percent to 20 percent disabling, effective November 1, 2024.  See October 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ proposed reducing the Veteran's right shoulder condition from 40 percent disabling to 20 percent disabling.

In an August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ decreased the Veteran's right shoulder condition from 40 percent disabling to 20 percent disabling effective November 1, 2024. 

VA regulations allow for the reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability when warranted by the evidence, but only after VA follows certain procedural guidelines.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the Veteran does not contend any noncompliance with the procedural requirements for rating reductions, and none is shown by the record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  Therefore, the Board will focus only upon whether the facts warrant a rating reduction.

Rating agencies will handle cases affected by change of medical findings or diagnosis so as to produce the greatest degree of stability of disability ratings consistent with the laws and VA regulations governing disability compensation and pension.  VA benefits recipients, however, may be afforded greater protections under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) and (b), which set forth the requirements for reduction of ratings in effect for five years or more.  The requirements prescribe that only evidence of sustained material improvement under the ordinary conditions of life, as shown by full and complete examinations, can justify a reduction.  These provisions also prohibit a reduction on the basis of a single examination.  See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 417-18 (1995).

However, with respect to other disabilities that are likely to improve (i.e., those with ratings in effect for less than five years), reexaminations disclosing improvement in disabilities will warrant a rating reduction.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).  Specifically, in such cases it is necessary to ascertain, based upon a review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in disability and whether examination reports reflecting change are based upon thorough examinations.  In addition, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  See Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 420-21 (citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10 and 4.13); 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).  Additionally, in determining whether a reduction was proper, the Board must focus upon evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of rating whether the condition had actually improved.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-282 (1992).  It should be emphasized, however, that such after-the-fact evidence may not be used to justify an improper reduction.

When the AOJ promulgated the proposed rating reduction in August 2024, effective November 1, 2024, the 40 percent rating for a right shoulder condition had been continuously in effect since January 4, 2023, a period of less than five years.  As such, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) and (b), regarding evidentiary requirements for a disability rating in effect for a period of five years or more, are not applicable.

As noted, 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2 and 4.10, taken together, however, mandate that in any rating reduction, irrespective of the time that the disability rating has been in effect, it must not only be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, "but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work."  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000) (citing Brown (Kevin) v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993)); cf. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

The Veteran's right shoulder condition is rated under diagnostic code (DC) 5010-5201.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned.  The additional code is shown after a hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

Limitation of motion of the arm is evaluated under DC 5201.  Ratings assigned pursuant to this code may differ depending on whether the extremity at issue is considered the major (dominant) extremity or the minor (non-dominant) extremity.  The Veteran in this case is right-handed, therefore his right arm is his dominant extremity.  See January 2023 C&P Exam.  

The rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020).  These amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities."  Id.

If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  In this case, the Veteran's claim will only be considered under the new rating criteria, which were in effect during the entire review period. 

As of February 7, 2021, under the amended criteria, DC 5201 indicated that limitation of motion of the shoulder should be rated as follows: Flexion and/or abduction limited to 25 degrees from side warrants a 40 percent rating in the major extremity and a 30 percent rating in the minor extremity; Midway between side and shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 45 degrees) warrants a 30 percent rating in the major extremity and a 20 percent rating in the minor extremity; At shoulder level (flexion and/or abduction limited to 90 degrees) warrants a 20 percent rating in the major extremity and a 20 percent rating in the minor extremity.

For reference, standard ranges of shoulder motion are forward elevation (flexion) and abduction each from 0 to 180 degrees (with shoulder level at 90 degrees); and external and internal rotation each to 90 degrees.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate I.

The Veteran was first service connected for a right shoulder condition in August 2014 under Diagnostic Code 5201-5019 at 10 percent disabling.  See August 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet.

The Veteran's right shoulder rating was rated 40 percent disabling from January 4, 2023, under DC 5010-5201 following a January 2023 VA examination.  The examiner found that the Veteran was diagnosed with right shoulder strain in 2014, right shoulder impingement in January 2023, right shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis in January 2023, and right glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis in September 2022.  Flare ups were reported by the Veteran four to five times a week for 45 to 60 minutes each time.  Pain was aggravated by lifting/carrying/pushing/pulling with any overhead movement/tasks.  Range of motion was most limited during flare ups, with flexion endpoint to 20 degrees, abduction endpoint to 20 degrees, internal rotation endpoint to 5 degrees, and external rotation endpoint to 5 degrees.  Functional impact was noted as difficulty lifting/carrying/pushing/pulling heavy objects and with any overhead movement/tasks at work.  See January 2023 C&P Exam. 

The Veteran was given a subsequent VA examination for his right shoulder in September 2023.  The examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with right shoulder strain with impingement syndrome, rotator cuff tendonitis and glenohumeral joint arthritis (dominant) in 2014.  No flare ups of the shoulder were reported during the examination, despite severely limiting flare ups of the right shoulder being reported earlier in the year during the January 2023 VA examination.  No range of motion limitations were noted during the September 2023 VA examination despite very restricted range of motions limitations during the January 2023 VA examination.  Functional loss was noted as right shoulder pain and stiffness which limited the Veteran's ability to perform overhead lifting, which was similar to the functional limitations noted in the January 2023 VA examination, with no improvements shown.  See September 2023 C&P Exam.

The Veteran's medical records do not correspond with the findings of the September 2023 VA examiner.  A September 2022 private x-ray of the Veterans right shoulder showed pain without trauma and mild to moderate glenohumeral degeneration.  An April 2023 private medical note showed right shoulder impingement, stable with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and loss of weight as the Veteran was not lifting due to his shoulder.  There was no indication that the Veteran's right shoulder flare ups, which severely limited range of motion in the January 2023 VA examination, had improved or dissipated.  See January 2023 C&P Exam, January 2024 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

The Veteran's medical records show that he had ongoing right shoulder issues.  In fact, there was no indication from the Veteran's medical records that his right shoulder condition was improving, and any indication of improvement would be speculative at best.  See January 2023 C&P Exam, September 2023 C&P Exam, January 2024 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.  Accordingly, and as a result of the September 2023 VA examiner failing to explain why the Veteran no longer experienced right shoulder flare ups, the September 2023 VA examination is afforded low probative weight.  Id. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the August 2024 rating decision that reduced the Veteran's right shoulder condition from a 40 percent rating to a 20 percent rating was improper and is void ab initio (void from the beginning).  The 40 percent rating is restored, effective November 1, 2024.
