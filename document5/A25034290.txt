Accordingly, the decision?is?subject to the AMA. The Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board in an October 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105.

On February 28, 2025, VA received the Veteran's request in writing to withdraw his pending service connection claims for sinusitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia without lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatitis before the Board. The Veteran indicated he wished to withdraw his claims pending before the Board to pursue the matters on Higher-Level Review before the AOJ. The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review on February 17, 2025. Thus, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
