DOCKET NO. 240826-467303
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of the August 26, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraines, the Veteran had a May 8, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement pending at the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) regarding the same issue.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1987 to July 1991.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the August 26, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In a May 8, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran requested review of his claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines, hearing loss, and sleep disturbances.  Subsequently, the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182 on August 26, 2024, for the same issue of migraines, while the May 8, 2024, NOD was still pending.

Under the AMA, once a claimant has filed a higher-level review, an appeal to the Board, or a supplemental claim, the claimant may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file a request for another review option with respect to the same claim, or same issue contained within the claim, until the higher-level review, appeal to the Board, or supplemental claim is adjudicated or withdrawn.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  No such withdrawal or adjudication has taken place.  

Accordingly, due to the prohibition against concurrent election, the appeal for entitlement to service connection for migraines was improperly docketed under Docket Number 240826-467303.  The issue of service connection for migraines was the only issue appealed; therefore, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

?

Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
