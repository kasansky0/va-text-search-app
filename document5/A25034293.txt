REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2010 to October 2010.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis and maxillary sinusitis, most recently addressed in December 2019 and March 2020 rating decisions. In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

To the extent any time remains for a docket switch pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the Board finds that the Veteran will not be prejudiced by the Board immediately issuing the decision herein, which constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought.

1. Entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for maxillary sinusitis is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for allergic rhinitis and maxillary sinusitis. See August 2024 VA Form 10182.

The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made findings of new and relevant evidence, an allergic rhinitis diagnosis, and a maxillary sinusitis diagnosis. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

According to a January 2018 statement attached to a notice of disagreement (NOD), in service, the Veteran suffered from violent sneezes and itchy, inflamed eyes, which got worse. 

In October 2019, the Veteran uploaded buddy statements that discussed his in-service allergies and nasal issues, particularly after field training/operations. 

In October 2019, the Veteran uploaded September 2019 private opinions (uploaded as "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility"). In the rhinitis opinion, the private examiner said that the Veteran was exposed to dust, fumes, and smoke during service. The Veteran had severe sneezing, dry cough, itchy eyes and throat, watery eyes, nasal congestion with blockage, and postnasal drip. 

The private examiner said that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is related to service because of the occurrence of symptoms after exposure to airborne irritants. The airborne irritants cause degranulation of the mast cells releasing histamine in the respiratory and nasal mucosa resulting in inflammation, increased secretions, and edema leading to nasal blockage and postnasal drip. 

?

In the sinusitis opinion, the private examiner said that the Veteran started having rhinitis symptoms in service and later on, he started having a fever, facial pain, and yellowish sinus discharge. He has had five-to-six sinus infections per year, characterized by fever, sinus pain, headaches, and a yellowish sinus drainage.

The private examiner said that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's maxillary sinusitis is related to service because of the exposures to airborne irritants in service. The mucosal edema and obstruction of the ostia meatal complex are the risk factors for sinusitis. The alteration in the sinus ostia patency, ciliary function and the quality of the secretions lead to the stagnation of the secretions within the sinus causing decreased pH, decreased oxygen within the sinus, resulting in favorable environment for bacterial growth.

The Board finds the private examiner's opinion to be adequate in that the examiner relied upon the examiner's own expertise, knowledge, and training. Further, the examiner considered the lay evidence and the medical history of the Veteran.

In a February 2020 statement, the Veteran described additional relevant in-service symptoms and specific instances where he experienced them.

In February 2024, a VA examiner provided a positive nexus opinion based on lay statements. 

An April 2024 VA addendum opinion provided a negative nexus, which the Board finds inadequate because it relies on the absence of evidence of in-service treatment. 

?

After resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, given the adequate September 2019 private opinions, the Board finds that direct service connection for allergic rhinitis and maxillary sinusitis is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
