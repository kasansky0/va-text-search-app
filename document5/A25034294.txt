DOCKET NO. 210624-168219
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 4, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received correspondence from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, requesting a withdrawal of his appeal for entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran through his authorized representative have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1995 to August 1998.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A hearing was held in October 2024. At the hearing, the Veteran's representative indicated that they were not planning to pursue the hypertension appeal, and the representative was requested to provide a written statement to this effect after the hearing. On February 4, 2025, the Board received a correspondence confirming the withdrawal request from the Veteran's representative.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the veteran or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
