ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior January 24, 2024 for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  On October 12, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0996, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC, in which the Veteran marked that he intended to file a claim for compensation.  

2.  More than one year later on January 24, 2024, the Veteran filed a formal claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea; there is no evidence of an intent to file after October 12, 2023, the expiration of the one-year filing period associated with the October 12, 2022 intent to file or a formal claim prior to January 24, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior January 24, 2024 for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 3  C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from June 1977 to July 1980.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision.  As this rating decision constitutes an initial decision, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1.  Entitlement to an effective date prior January 24, 2024 for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

For purposes of determining the effective date of an award, the date of application shall be considered the date of the filing of the initial application for a benefit if the claim is continuously pursued by filing any of the following, either alone or in succession:  (A) A request for higher-level review under 38 U.S.C. § 5104B on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (B) a supplemental claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (C) a notice of disagreement on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues a decision; (D) a supplemental claim under section 5108 of this title  38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the Board of Veterans' Appeals issues a decision; and (E) a supplemental claim under 38 U.S.C. § 5108 on or before the date that is one year after the date on which the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims issues a decision.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2).

A claim that is adjudicated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as either allowed or disallowed is considered finally adjudicated when, for legacy claims not subject to the modernized review system, whichever of the following occurs first: (i) the expiration of the period in which to file a Notice of Disagreement, pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 19.52(a) or 38 C.F.R. § 20.502(a), as applicable; or (ii) disposition on appellate review.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(1).  For claims under the modernized review system, a claim is considered finally adjudicated upon the expiration of the period in which to file a review option available under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 or disposition on judicial review where no such review option is available.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(2).

A reopened claim is an application for a benefit received prior to the effective date of the modernized review system on February 19, 2019, after final disallowance of an earlier claim that is subject to readjudication on the merits based on receipt of new and material evidence related to the finally adjudicated claim, or any claim based on additional evidence or a request for a personal hearing submitted more than 90 days following notification to the appellant of the certification of an appeal and transfer of applicable records to the Board which was not considered by the Board in its decision and was referred to the agency of original jurisdiction for consideration as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b)(1).  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160(e), 19.2(a).  As of February 19, 2019, claimants may no longer file to reopen a claim, but may file a supplemental claim as prescribed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 to apply for a previously disallowed benefit.  Id.  Except as otherwise provided, for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issued a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued a decision, the effective date shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(3).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not of full age or capacity, who indicates a desire to file for benefits under the laws administered by VA, by a communication or action, to include an electronic mail that is transmitted through VA's electronic portal or otherwise, that does not meet the standards of a complete claim is considered a request for an application form for benefits under § 3.150(a).  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Upon receipt of such a communication or action, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary.  Id.

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  An intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of three ways, including a saved electronic application.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1).  When an application otherwise meeting the requirements of this paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool within a VA web-based electronic claims application system prior to filing of a complete claim, VA will consider that application to be an intent to file a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(i).  The Board notes that the preface to the amended version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 states that the provisions of this section are applicable to all claims governed by part 3, with the exception that paragraph (b) of this section, regarding Intent to File, does not apply to supplemental claims.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated the portion of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the Intent to File framework because it contravened the unambiguous meaning of its governing statutory provisions.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A complete claim is required for all types of claims.  If a complete claim is submitted within one year of receipt of such incomplete application form prescribed by VA, VA will consider it as filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application form prescribed by VA that did not meet the standards of a complete claim.  Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file a claim for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim.  In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within one year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  In the event that VA receives both an intent to file a claim and an incomplete application form before the complete claim is filed, the complete claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of whichever was filed first provided it is perfected within the necessary timeframe, but in no event will the complete claim be considered filed more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the complete claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c)-(d).

VA will not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension).  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).  If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior intent to file will have no effect.  Id.  If, however, VA receives an intent to file followed by a complete claim and later another intent to file for the same benefit is submitted within 1 year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent intent to file.  Id.

A complete claim is defined as a submission of an application form prescribed by VA, whether paper or electronic, that meets the following requirements:  (1) provides the name of the claimant; the relationship to the veteran, if applicable; and sufficient service information for VA to verify the claimed service, if applicable; (2) is signed by the claimant or a person legally authorized to sign for the claimant; (3) identifies the benefit sought; (4) provides a description of any symptom(s) or medical condition(s) on which the benefit is based to the extent the form prescribed by VA so requires; and (5) for nonservice-connected disability or death pension and parents' dependency and indemnity compensation claims, provides a statement of income to the extent the form prescribed by VA so requires.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a).

Under the former regulations prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Medical records cannot constitute an initial claim for service connection; rather there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for the benefit.  Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501 (2006); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998).

A pending claim is a claim which has not been finally adjudicated.  38 C.F.R. § 3.160(c).  The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it.  Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999).  Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper.  Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

For pending legacy claims not under the modernized review system, new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period, or prior to the appellate decision if a timely appeal has been filed, will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim which was pending at the beginning of the appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Where a claim is granted based on new and material evidence received within an appeal period or prior to an appellate decision, the effective date shall be as though the former decision had not been rendered.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q).

In regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation.  However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).  It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011).  For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested.  Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Analysis

The record shows that the February 2024 rating decision on appeal granted entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea effective from January 24, 2024 as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI).  The Veteran has indicated that he is entitled to an earlier effective date of July 31, 2023 for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea based on an intent to file a claim that he submitted on that date.

The Board must determine the date of claim and the date entitlement arose.

As relevant to this case, to determine the date of claim, on October 12, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-0996, Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC, in which the Veteran marked that he intended to file a claim for compensation.  A review of the record does not show any informal or formal claim for sleep apnea prior to the October 12, 2022 intent to file.  In an October 12, 2022 letter sent to the Veteran, the AOJ acknowledged its receipt of the Veteran's intent to file on October 12, 2022.  The letter explained that if the Veteran's completed application was received within one year from the date of the intent to file and they decided he was entitled to VA benefits, the AOJ may be able to compensate the Veteran from the date they received his intent to file.  If the completed application was not received within one year from the date that the intent to file was received and they decided that he was entitled to VA benefits, the AOJ could only compensate the Veteran from the date they received the completed application.

Within the one-year period following the October 12, 2022 intent to file, without filing a complete claim, the Veteran submitted a second intent to file on July 31, 2023 with a VA Form 21-0966 in which the Veteran once more noted that he intended to file a claim for compensation.  However, VA does not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).  If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior intent to file will have no effect.  Id.  Therefore, the second intent to file received by VA on July 31, 2023 had no effect as to this claim. It does not serve as a place holder for any subsequent claims for compensation because it was filed within one year of the October 2022 intent to file, and before any formal claim for compensation benefits was submitted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).  Thus, it is a nullity as to determining the date of claim in this case, and the only valid intent to file is the October 2022 submission.

More than one year after the October 12, 2022 intent to file was received, the Veteran submitted a January 24, 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, in which he claimed entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.  There is no evidence of a claim within one year of the October 12, 2022 intent to file, or an intent to file after October 12, 2023, and before January 24, 2024, which would be following the expiration of the one-year filing period associated with the October 12, 2022 intent to file. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that although the Veteran submitted an intent to file on July 31, 2023 within the one-year period prior to the January 24, 2024 VA form 21-526EZ, this intent to file cannot be used to extend the filing timeline associated with the October 12, 2022 intent to file, and thus it had no effect on the assigned date of claim.  Thus, the date of claim is January 24, 2024.

As to when entitlement arose, even if it arose prior to January 24, 2024, the effective date would have to be the later of the two dates, which would be the current date of the January 24, 2024 claim.  An effective date earlier than January 24, 2024, for the grant of service connection for sleep apnea is denied.
