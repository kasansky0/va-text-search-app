REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1958 to June 1961. 

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an August 15, 2024, rating decision denying his service connection claims.  On October 8, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 15, 2024, decision and continued and confirmed the denial the claims. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on February 19, 2025. A hearing transcript is associated with the claims file. At the Board hearing, the Veteran did not submit any evidence and expressly waived on the record his 90 day evidence window following the hearing. See Hearing Transcript at 2 (December 2024). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 15, 2024, agency of AOJ decision on appeal; the 90 days window for submitting evidence after the hearing was waived and no evidence was submitted during that timeframe. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran contends his current low back and bilateral knee disabilities are secondary to his service-connected bilateral pes planus. See VA Form 21-526EZ (September 2023); VA 21-4138 (January 2024) (asserting "pes planus has historically been known to cause issues in the knees and back"); Third Party Correspondence (October 2024) (asserting "dysfunction in one part of the body can affect others"); Hearing Transcript at 3. 

During his Board hearing the Veteran was asked whether he was solely asserting a theory of secondary service connection for his claimed disabilities to which he responded "correct", however, he also testified that his low back disability had an onset during service as result of "standing on concert floors for prolonged periods." See Hearing Transcript at 7 compared to at 13. Additionally, he had previously asserted onset of his disabilities during service noting that "upon separation from service, I was already started exhibiting symptoms of my claimed conditions in form of pain in lower as well as both of my knees...these issues have persisted since my service." See VA 21-4138 (August 2024). The Veteran further asserted his disabilities are related to the "unique stresses of [his] military service." See Third Party Correspondence (October 2024). Given the nature of the Veteran's statements throughout pendency of appeal, including during his Board Hearing, the Board will not limit the appeal to theory of secondary service connection. See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552-56 (2008).  

Service treatment records (STR) show in August 1959, the Veteran presented with complaints of "sore back and legs" which was identified as non-specific back and foot ache; a thoracic spine x-ray was normal; and he as advice to treat with heat for four days. See STR-Medical (July 2008). Two days later, the Veteran complained of "back pain aggravated by prolonged standing & lifting" and he was rechecked for back pain and remove from mess duty for two weeks.   See STR-Medical (July 2008). Subsequent STRs do not show complaints or treatment for back or knee related problems. Indeed, a June 1961 report of medical examination (RME) at separation shows normal evaluation of his spine and bilateral lower extremities. See STR-Medical (July 2008). There is no available associated report of medical history (RMH) at separation. See STR-Medical (July 2008).

VA treatment records show the Veteran established VA care in September 2010, and at that time, reported a history of episodic back stiffness; and diagnostic reports revealed evidence of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine in August 2011. See CAPRI (March 2018). In July 2012, he reports having knee problems and recently being treated privately for right knee pain, and July 2013 VA x-rays revealed evidence of degenerative changes in the right knee but a normal left knee. See CAPRI (March 2018). More recent 2023 VA x-rays reveal evidence of severe osteoarthritis of the right knee and mild osteoarthritis of the left knee. See CAPRI (August 2024). Additionally, the Veteran reported history of low back pain for past 30 years and bilateral knee pain for past 15 to 20 years. See VA 21-4138 (September 2023). 

The issues of entitlement to service connection are remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the August 15, 2024, rating decision, subject to the HLR decision on appeal. 

First, VA has a duty to assist claimants includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency and making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency, to include records from private medical care providers. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1), (2). Here, prior to the rating decision on appeal, VA treatment records contained entries for scanned documents but a copy of those records are not associated with the claims file system. Specifically, VA treatment records contain entry for scanned document concerning "Non-VA reports" from Radiology St. Joseph's Area Health, dated July 25, 2012, and from Park Rapids Ortho, dated April 17, 2013, which are relevant to his right knee. See CARPI (March 2018). VA treatment records also contained entries for scanned document concerning "Non-VA" medical records for Chiropractic care concerning low back pain on multiple occasions between July 20, 2020 to September 16, 2020, September 15, 2021 to October 25, 2021, April 5, 2023, to June 15, 2023. See CAPRI (August 2024). Additionally, VA treatment records contained scanned documents for "Non-VA reports" from St. Joseph's Area Health, dated June 23, 2006, and it is unclear whether these are relevant to the claims from the available records. See CARPI (March 2018). The AOJ had a duty to associate a copy of federally held records not typically housed with the CAPRI records and associate them with the claims file. Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786, 793 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Second, VA has a duty to assist claimants include obtaining reasonably identified relevant outstanding non-VA (private) treatment records. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records). Here, prior to the decision on appeal, VA treatment records show the Veteran reported treatment from Rapid City Orthopedic for his right knee in July 2012 and August 2012. See CARPI (March 2018). VA treatment records also show he reported receiving regular private care from Innovis Park Rapids Group and has history of episodic low back stiffness prior to starting VA care in September 2010. These identified private records are relevant to issues on appeal, but the record does not reveal that VA attempted to obtain the referenced records, to include asking the Veteran to submit an authorization for release of the private treatment records.  

Third, VA's duty to assist claimants in the development of their claims includes obtaining an examination and/or opinion when necessary to decide the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). Further, once an examination or opinion is obtained, VA must ensure that it is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (when VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate).

Here, prior to the decision on appeal, the AOJ obtained medical opinions dated in December 2023 and April 2024 addressing theory of secondary service connection. Specifically, both VA-obtained opinions concluded that it is "less likely that the Veteran's back and knee conditions are due to his pes planus as pes planus does not cause or contribute to back or knee conditions." See C&P Exam (December 2023); C&P Exam (April 2024). The same rationale was provided:

Veteran has history of back and knee conditions as well as flat feet. However, flatfeet do not cause a back or knee conditions as dysfunction is a kinetic chain that starts above and progresses below, not the other way around. It is common medical knowledge that the back and the quads, glutes, and hamstrings bear the burden of body weight and function. When there is dysfunction in these muscle groups it may cause issues in smaller none weight bearing joints below such as the ankles and feet. Furthermore, the wear on his knees shown on xray are uneven and were his feet to have caused his knee condition it would be expected to be similar on both sides and it is not. Furthermore the arthritic changes seen in his back and knee xrays are expected as this is a condition that is a natural progression of disease due to age, family genetics, weight, etc. We would expect that he would have this level of arthritis at this age in both his back and his knees which is not due to his pes planus. Therefore it is less likely that the Veteran's back and knee conditions are due to his pes planus as pes planus does not cause or contribute to back or knee conditions.

See C&P Exam (December 2023); C&P Exam (April 2024).

Additionally, in February 2024 knee and back VA examination reports concluded that the Veteran's "arthritis more likely due to natural progress of disease due to age" without any further explanation.  See C&P Exam (February 2024). 

First, the Board find these VA- opinions are inadequate for addressing secondary service connection for the low back and knees as no opinion considers or discusses the relevant medical treatise article submitted by the Veteran. See Mariano v. Principi, 17, Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003) (a VA medical examiner's conclusions were of "questionable probative value" when the VA examiner failed to consider certain relevant information); Mattern v. West, 12 Vet. App. 222, 228 (1999) (medical treatise evidence can provide important support when combined with an opinion of a medical professional). Prior to the rating decision on appeal, although the VA-obtained opinions relies on "common medical knowledge," it does not consider, discuss, or analyze the pertinent medical treatise article submitted by the Veteran in August 2024 concerning how flat foot can alter the lower limb alignment and cause knee and back pain. See Web / HTML Documents (August 2024) ("Flat foot and spinal degeneration: evidence from nationwide population-based cohort study"). This medical treatise article is relevant in the context of determining whether the Veteran's low back and bilateral knee arthritis would have developed but for his service-connected bilateral pes planus, and a remand is necessary to obtain an addendum opinion that considers this potentially favorable medical treatise evidence.

Also, the February 2024 VA opinions attributing the Veteran's bilateral knee arthritis to age is inadequate as it provides no explanation that reconciles the difference in severity of arthritis affecting each knee, which casts doubt on the opinion's foundation and conclusion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (it must be clear that the examiner was "informed of sufficient facts upon which to base an opinion relevant to the problem at hand.")

Second, no opinion addresses the aggravation prong of secondary service connection-that is whether the Veteran's low back and bilateral knee disabilities would be less severe but for his service-connected bilateral pes planus. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013) (emphasizing that a specific inquiry directly addressing aggravation, separate from whether a service-connected disability caused the disability, is necessary when an examiner addresses secondary service connection).

Additionally, the AOJ did not obtain an opinion addressing the Veteran's theory of direct service connection for his low back disability. A liberal reading of the Veteran's pleading along with review of the record raised that issue prior to the AOJ issuing the decision on appeal. See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552-553 (2008). Here, the record contains the Veteran's reports of onset of low pain during service which has persisted since then. See VA 21-4138 (August 2024). Additionally, August 1959 STRs reflect the Veteran complaints of "non-specific back and foot ache" and reports of back pain aggravated by prolonged standing and lifting despite normal findings a lower thoracic spine x-ray. See STR - Medical (July 2008). Given his STR document treatment for back complaints during service, VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion addressing direct service connection was triggered. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist error on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted private medical opinions (hereafter, opinion) from Dr. Y. T., a podiatrist, dated in February 2024 and July 2024, linking his current low back and/or bilateral knee disabilities to his service-connected bilateral pes planus. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2024); Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (August 2024). The Board finds the opinion inadequate for adjudicative purposes the essential rationale for the opinion is not discernable. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012). At most, the opinion provides the Board with medical findings and conclusions but the opinion does not reveal a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007). For example, the opinion notes the Veteran "symptoms and conditions are related to biomechanical imbalance of the feet during stance and gait" but lacks an explanation connecting the symptoms of imbalance to the diagnoses; instead the opinion only discusses treatment options to correct the biomechanical imbalance. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion that contains only data and conclusions without any supporting analysis connecting the two is accorded no weight).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and separately associate with the claims file, the treatment records noted to be scanned documents for outside medical record concerning: 

(a.) St. Joseph's Area Health, dated June 23, 2006 (electronically filed August 17, 2012);

(b.) Radiology St. Joseph's Area Health, dated July 25, 2012 (electronically filed November 2, 2012);

(c.) Park Rapids Ortho, dated April 17, 2013 (electronically filed June 22, 2013);

(d.) Choice First - Ortho, June 29, 2016 (electronically filed July 7, 2016); 

(e.) Chiropractic Care, various dates between July 20, 2020 to September 16, 2020, September 15, 2021 to October 25, 2021, and April 5, 2023, to June 15, 2023. 

2. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for his right knee treatment at Rapid City Orthopedic in July 2012 and August 2012 and for primary care treatment from Innovis Park Rapids prior to 2010. Make two requests for the authorized records from the identified facilities, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

3. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to address the etiology of the Veteran's low back disability. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal. The clinician must opine on:

Optional: The clinician may consider the Veteran's history as to onset and progression; and any documented history in formulating an opinion.

Direct Service Connection 

(a.)  Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's low back disability is related to his August 1959 in-service treatment for back pain and his reports of back pain exacerbated by prolonged standing and lifting. Explain.

Consider STR showing (1) treatment for non-specific back ache in August 1959 and normal lumb spine x-ray; (2) June 1961 RME at separation show normal spine evaluation; and (3) post-service medical records noting complaints of episodic back stiffness and diagnostic findings of degenerative arthritis.   

Secondary Service Connection 

(b.) Whether the Veteran's low back disability is at least as likely as not caused by or the result of service-connected bilateral pes planus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" causation.

(c.) Alternatively, whether the Veteran's low back disability is at least as likely as not aggravated service-connected his bilateral pes planus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" aggravation-in other words, would the Veteran's low back disability be less severe "but for" his pes planus. 

Aggravation exists when nonservice-connected disability becomes functionally worsened due to an inability to treat the condition because of a service-connected disability.

Consider: (1) the medical articles submitted by the Veteran concerning flat feet altering musculoskeletal alignment in lower limbs leading to back and knee pain (Web / HTML Documents (August 2024)); and (2) August 2024 private opinion indicating flat fleet result in biomechanical imbalance of the feet during stance and gait and development of low back and knee pain. 

4. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to address the etiology of the Veteran's low back disability. The phrase "at least as likely as not" means the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal. The clinician must opine on:

Optional: The clinician may consider the Veteran's history as to onset and progression; and any documented history in formulating an opinion.

(a.) Whether the Veteran's left and/or right knee disability is at least as likely as not caused by or the result of service-connected bilateral pes planus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" causation.

(b.) Alternatively, whether the Veteran's left and/or right knee disability is at least as likely as not aggravated service-connected his bilateral pes planus. Explain. 

NOTE: The examiner is advised all that is needed is a "but for" aggravation-in other words, would the Veteran's left and/or right knee disability be less severe "but for" his pes planus. 

Aggravation exists when nonservice-connected disability becomes functionally worsened due to an inability to treat the condition because of a service-connected disability.
