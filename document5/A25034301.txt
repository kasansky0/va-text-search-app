DOCKET NO. 240524-443813
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has continually pursued claims for hearing-related symptoms since a relevant intent to file a claim was received on May 17, 2022, and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus had at least arisen from that date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1972 to August 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 higher-level review decision following an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.  This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window.  Therefore, the Board has not considered that evidence in its present decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a).  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran asserts that an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, for service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

Generally, the effective date for a service connection claim is either the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  However, an intent to file a claim can be submitted to VA on a prescribed form, and if VA receives the complete prescribed application form within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the claim filed as of the date that the intent to file was received.  See Jernigan v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 220 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  The date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought.  This is determined on a factual basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication indicating an intent to apply for benefits may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form would be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If the form was received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it would be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

On May 17, 2022, VA received an intent to file a claim.  See May 2022 Notification Letter.  The next day, VA received a claim for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.  See May 2022 Fully Developed Claim.  The hearing loss claim was denied in an August 2022 rating decision.  Later, in August 2022, another intent to file a claim was received.  In October 2022, VA received a supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for hearing loss and a claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  See October 2022 Supplemental Claim Application; October 2022 Fully Developed Claim.  The hearing loss claim was denied in a November 2022 rating decision.  In December 2022, the Veteran requested higher-level review of the hearing loss claim.  The tinnitus claim was denied in a February 2023 rating decision.  Later, in February 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review of the tinnitus claim.  A subsequent rating decision in February 2023 found pre-decisional duty to assist errors for the hearing loss and tinnitus claims.  The hearing loss claim was denied in an April 2023 rating decision.  The tinnitus claim was granted in an October 2023 rating decision.  Following the October 2023 rating decision, the Veteran continued to pursue the hearing loss claim until it was ultimately granted.    

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, for service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

Specifically, May 17, 2022, was the date that the original intent to file a claim was received.  Within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA received a claim for entitlement to service connection related to hearing symptoms.  Since then, the Veteran had continuously pursued claims for hearing-related symptoms until entitlement to service connection for tinnitus was finally granted.  As a result, May 17, 2022, would be the proper effective date for service connection for tinnitus if the Veteran was entitled to service connection for tinnitus as of that date (i.e., the Veteran had tinnitus as of that date).

An August 2022 VA examination found that the onset of tinnitus was in the 1970s.  Therefore, from at least May 17, 2022, the Veteran had tinnitus.  As such, May 17, 2022, is the proper effective date for service connection for tinnitus.

The Board notes that there was no intent to file a claim received by VA prior to May 17, 2022, and that no formal claim for entitlement to service connection was received prior to May 17, 2022.  Additionally, no document received prior to May 17, 2022, indicated intent to pursue a relevant claim for entitlement to service connection.

Therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 17, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for tinnitus is granted.
