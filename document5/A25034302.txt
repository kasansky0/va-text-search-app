FINDING OF FACT

VA has been notified that the Veteran passed away in August 2024.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding entitlement to an effective date prior to June 15, 2023 for the grant of service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 50 percent for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1968 to September 1970.

This matter was previously denied by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in January 2024. The Veteran appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

During the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran died in August 2024.

In December 2024, the Court ordered that the January 2024 Board decision was vacated and that the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

The Board's?dismissal?does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's?death.?38 C.F.R. § 3.1010?(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000?(a), 3.1010(a). 

Here, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution. Accordingly, the appeal is?dismissed.
