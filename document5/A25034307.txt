ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran is unable to obtain or maintain a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 4.16, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran has active service from March 1970 to October 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the claim of entitlement to TDIU, it may not consider this evidence in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Although all the evidence of record has been thoroughly reviewed, only the most relevant and salient evidence is discussed below. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The analysis in this decision focuses on what the evidence shows or fails to show with respect to the matter decided herein. The Veteran should not assume that pieces of evidence not explicitly discussed herein have been overlooked. See Allday v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 517, 527 (1995).

1. Entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability

The Veteran is claiming he is unable to obtain or maintain a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities. See October 2023 VA Form 21-8940.

Legal Criteria

Total disability ratings will be assigned "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation." 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a). An award of TDIU does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, an award of TDIU does require that the claimant show an inability to secure and follow substantially gainful employment as a result of a service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

TDIU may be assigned when the schedular rating is less than total and a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of his or her service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

For the purposes of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in combination, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) Disabilities of one or both upper extremities, one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 339 (2018) (combining disabilities as "one disability" to meet the rating threshold of § 4.16(a) requires the use of the combined rating table).

If a veteran does not meet the schedular criteria for TDIU but the evidence shows he or she is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities, the Board may not consider the claim for TDIU in the first instance but will refer it to the Director of Compensation Service. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). As described in Ray v. Wilkie, the correct standard for referral is whether there is "sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable by reason of his or her service-connected disabilities." Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

Entitlement to a TDIU is a legal determination, not a medical one. Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Medical examiners may provide evidence regarding functional and occupational impairment, but the Board must decide whether a veteran may "secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" based on all evidence of record. See Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 243 (2019).

Unlike the regular disability Rating Schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstance." Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to a veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; see also Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The sole fact that a Veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment. The ultimate question is whether a Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

Background Facts and Analysis

The Board notes that the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for TDIU by having at least a single disability ratable at 60 percent or more or two or more disabilities with at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. See October 2022 rating decision.

The Veteran has reported that he has not been working during the pendency of this appeal. See October 2022 VA Form 21-8940; see also May 2023 VA Form 21-8940; see also May 2023 VA Form 21-4192.

A July 2022 VA psych examination noted that the Veteran's service-connected anxiety disorder caused occupational and social impairment with occupational decreased in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks. This is caused by symptoms of disturbances in motivation and mood, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances including work or a work-like setting, depressed mood, anxiety, and sleep impairment.

A July 2022 VA reproductive organ examination noted the Veteran's service-connected residuals of prostate cancer impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks by not allowing to perform any heavy lifting and have ready access to the restroom due to urinary frequency and changing of absorbent material due to urinary leakage.

A November 2022 VA urinary tract examination noted the Veteran's prostate cancer residuals impacted his ability to work due to urinary leakage that requires occasional changing of pads and clothing.

A March 2023 VA psych examination noted the Veteran's anxiety disorder caused occupational impairment due to difficulty attending to or being easily distracted from the task at hand, significant difficulty remembering instructions and details of work assignments, significant difficulty functioning around other people, difficulty functioning as a team member, feeling uncomfortable around others, and sleep disruption leading to fatigue and difficulty with concentration and focus.

A March 2023 VA audio examination indicated the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus distracted ability to hear speech through the tinnitus. The Veteran's service-connected hearing loss was noted to cause difficulty with the Veteran's ability to hear co-workers, communicate on the phone, and hear in noisy backgrounds even with hearing aids.

A July 2023 VA audio examination noted the Veteran's hearing loss causes him to miss a lot of things people say and misunderstand conversations. The Veteran's tinnitus was reported as "annoying and distracting."

A November 2023 VA urinary tract examination noted the Veteran's prostate cancer residuals required frequent bathroom breaks and changing of absorbent pads. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records showed similar levels of impairments and complaints as those noted in his VA examinations.

Following a thorough review of the record, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities in combination preclude him from obtaining or maintaining a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, training, and experience. Therefore, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to TDIU is granted.
