ORDER

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on aid and attendance is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for an eating disorder is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hematochezia (claimed as rectal bleeding) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Due to service-connected disabilities, the Veteran is so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person.

2. The claim for special monthly compensation based on housebound is moot as the Veteran is in receipt of SMC based on aid attendance, which is a greater benefit.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that an eating disorder began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability preexisted service and was not aggravated during active service. 

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that hematochezia began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for SMC based on the need for aid and attendance pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (b), 3.352(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2007 to January 2012.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in June 2023 (bilateral hearing loss, hematochezia), March 2024 (eating disorder), and April 2024 (SMC) and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, for each issue, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance

SMC based on the need for aid and attendance of another is payable when the veteran, due to service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet or one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, or is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (b).

The Veteran has not lost use of both feet or one hand and one foot and she is not blind in both eyes. As such, whether SMC is warranted is determined by whether she is permanently bedridden or so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance.

As directed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a), the following criteria are to be considered for determining whether a claimant is in need of the regular aid and attendance of another person: (1) the inability of the claimant to dress himself or herself or to keep himself or herself ordinarily clean and presentable; (2) frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance which, by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without aid (not to include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); (3) the inability of the claimant to feed himself or herself through the loss of coordination of the upper extremities or through extreme weakness; (4) the inability to attend to the wants of nature; or, (5) a physical or mental incapacity that requires care and assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from the hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment.

"Bedridden," which is a proper basis for the determination, is defined as that condition which, through its essential character, actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350 (b)(4), 3.352(a).

It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need. Determinations that the veteran is so helpless, as to be in need of regular aid and attendance, will not be based solely upon an opinion that the claimant's condition is such as would require him or her to be in bed. They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a); Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996) (it is logical to infer there is a threshold requirement that "at least one of the enumerated factors be present").

Furthermore, the performance of the necessary aid and attendance service by a relative of the beneficiary or other member of his or her household will not prevent the granting of the additional allowance. 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (c).

At the Veteran's December 2022 VA examination for her service-connected bipolar disorder, she reported that she was dependent on her husband for things because she gets overwhelmed. She stated that she was no longer able to tolerate driving, shopping, or family outings, and that she spent almost all of her time at home in bed. 

In March 2024, she submitted VA Form 21-2680 Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance that had been completed by her private medical provider. The examination states that the Veteran was unable to prepare her own meals or manage her medications and that she needed assistance with bathing/showering, tending to hygiene needs, dressing, and housekeeping. 

Taken together, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran requires assistance with cooking, bathing, tending to hygiene needs, and medication management on a regular basis due to her service-connected bipolar disorder. 

For these reasons, the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render her in need of the aid and attendance of another person. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). Thus, SMC for aid and attendance is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on housebound

The Board notes that SMC based on aid and attendance is a greater benefit than SMC at the housebound rate. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l), 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 U.S.C. § 1502 (b). Therefore, the issue of entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate is moot.

3. Entitlement to service connection for an eating disorder

To establish service connection a Veteran must generally show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Review of VA treatment records shows a diagnosis of unspecified eating disorder, although there are not records of ongoing treatment for such a disorder. At the Veteran's most recent VA examination for her bipolar disorder, the examiner noted this diagnosis in the records and explained that the Veteran's symptoms of nausea-vomiting and occasional lack of appetite are more properly considered expressions of her depression and anxiety symptoms. 

Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of an eating disorder that is separate from her service-connected bipolar disorder. In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss disability

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of the examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1111. Mere history of pre-service existence of a disease does not constitute a notation of such condition. For example, if, at the entrance examination, a veteran reports a history of a medical condition, but the corresponding clinical evaluation does not indicate any abnormality, the condition is not considered to have been noted. See Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238 (1994). However, where a preexisting medical condition is noted on the clinical evaluation section of the entrance examination, then the question becomes whether service connection is warranted based on in-service aggravation of the pre-existing condition. 

A lack of aggravation may be shown by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089; Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. at 235; 38 U.S.C. § 1153. This burden of proof must be met by "affirmative evidence" demonstrating that there was no aggravation. The burden is not met by finding "that the record contains insufficient evidence of aggravation." Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. at 236-37.

The presumption of aggravation only requires evidence of an actual worsening of a preexisting condition during service; it does not require direct evidence of nexus, that is, that the worsening was actually caused by service. Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47-48 (2010). Therefore, a veteran must initially establish only that a preexisting condition worsened during service, and at that point the veteran has the benefit of the presumption of aggravation. If a permanent increase is shown, the presumption of aggravation may be rebutted only by clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 (a), (b).

However, if a preexisting disability is noted upon entry into service, the Veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that particular disability, but the Veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disability. In that case, § 1153 applies and the burden falls on the Veteran to establish aggravation. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d at 1096; Jensen v. Brown, 19 F.3d 1413, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1994). A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated during service when there is an increase in disability during service, unless there is a specific finding (clear and unmistakable evidence) that the increase in disability is due to the natural progression of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 (a). Clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 (b).

For a condition that was noted at entry, the pre-existing disease or injury will be presumed to have been aggravated by service only if the evidence shows that the underlying disability underwent an increase in severity; the occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability. See Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 (a).

"Clear and unmistakable evidence" is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable." Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003); Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009) (noting that clear and undebatable means that the evidence cannot be misinterpreted or misunderstood).

Hearing loss constitutes a disability for VA purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Upon entry to active service, the Veteran received an audiological examination. 

Pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 20	25	30	30	35

LEFT	15	25	30	35	50

These results showed hearing loss for VA purposes in both ears. The presumption of soundness therefore does not apply.

Another audiogram was conducted at separation in November 2011. Pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

 	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 20	25	30	35	40

LEFT	15	25	30	45	55

This again shows a bilateral hearing loss disability.

The Veteran received a VA examination in June 2014. The examiner noted the in-service audiograms and stated that there was no significant threshold shift between the two examinations. The opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's preexisting bilateral hearing loss disability did not increase in severity during her active service. The presumption of aggravation therefore does not attach, and service connection is not warranted. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for hematochezia (claimed as rectal bleeding)

The Veteran seeks service connection for hematochezia.  

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a diagnosis of hematochezia, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that it began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

Service treatment records do not contain complaints or treatment for this condition. Nor has the Veteran alleged specific instances or occurrences during service. 

Medical records indicate that the Veteran's hematochezia is due to her hemorrhoids, which are not service-connected. 

The evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
