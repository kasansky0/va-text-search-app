ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the initial diagnosis of obstructive sleep, which continues to the present, was rendered in November 2016, prior to his discharge from active duty.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran honorably served in the United States Army from March 1995 through January 2017, to include in the Southwest Theater of Operations during the Persian Gulf War.  He also had prior service of an unverified nature from September 1992 to March 1994 in the Virginia Army National Guard.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). The law creates a new framework for veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review, and this decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

In October 2016, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, (Initial Claim Application) seeking service connection for sleep apnea.  In February 2017, the RO issued a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and it became final. In December 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, (Supplemental Claim Application), for sleep apnea. In January 2021, the RO determined that new and relevant evidence had been received to reconsider the claim, however issued a rating decision denying service connection for sleep apnea. Subsequently, the Veteran filed his VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), electing the Evidence Submission docket. See August 2021 Notice of Disagreement.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea 

Service connection will be granted if it is shown that a veteran has a disability resulting from an injury or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Generally, to establish direct service connection, a veteran must show: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). All elements must be satisfied before service connection may be achieved. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Analysis

The Veteran contends he has a current disability of obstructive sleep apnea that had its onset during active duty. 

The first element of service connection requires a current disability of sleep apnea. Here, there is ambiguity as to whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of sleep apnea. After filing his claim for service connection for sleep apnea in October 2016 and prior to his separation from service in February 2017, the Veteran underwent a sleep study in November 2016, and the report of such reflects the following: 

1. No significant sleep disordered breathing observed with under mild OSA noted. An AHI 5 or greater along with more than 30 respiratory events are needed per Medicare guidelines for an OSA diagnosis. 2. Snoring, minimal. 3. Reduced sleep efficiency and extended awake times during study. 4. Reduced REM sleep noted. 5. Increased spontaneous arousal index, moderate.

In part, the plan/recommendation stated, "Patient's insignificant OSA diagnosis needs clinical correlation with patient's sleep related symptoms." Id. The progress note from the follow-up appointment reflected the following information. The sleep study provided an "AHI score of 1.24 per hour. With a total of 5 respiratory events, 3 obstructive and 2 central, reduced sleep efficiency and extended awake times during study. Minimal snoring. Reduced REM sleep noted. Increased spontaneous arousal index." See November 18, 2016 progress note. The treatment note reflected complaints of daytime fatigue throughout the day, nighttime leg kicking or unusual movements, snoring, insomnia, and unrefreshing sleep. Id. The examination noted a narrowed hypopharynx. He was assessed with having hypersomnia, insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorder (jet lag type), and snoring.  Id. The noted sleep history showed no snoring, no choking/gasping for air while sleeping, not disturbing spouse. Id. Listed medication included Ambien. Id. 

The Board observes that the November 2016 sleep study provides that the Veteran as an "insignificant OSA diagnosis," noting "no significant sleep disorder breathing noted with under mild OSA noted" in its impressions. The Board notes that the November 2016 sleep study indicated that Medicare guidelines require an AHI score of 5 or higher for a diagnosis of OSA, and the AHI score here was 1.24. However, as written, this does not indicate whether or not the healthcare provider determined that those guidelines were applicable to the Veteran's circumstances. 

Further, it cannot be ignored that the November 2016 sleep study explicitly notes "under mild OSA" and described the Veteran as having an "insignificant OSA diagnosis." Underscoring the ambiguity, the associated follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the sleep study provided the assessments of hypersomnia, insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorder (jet lag type), and snoring and fails to reconcile the noted OSA diagnosis in the November 8, 2016, sleep study interpretation. See November 18, 2016, progress note. 

In June 2020, the Veteran presented at a VA healthcare facility to establish care and sought a repeat sleep study regarding his reported history of obstructive sleep apnea. See June 2020 VA treatment record.  Here, the Veteran's sleep apnea is notated as "?OSA." Id. Evidence of record does not indicate whether the ordered sleep study was conducted during the period on appeal, as there is a gap in the records between early July 2020 and January 2021. Another June 2020 VA treatment record lists obstructive sleep apnea as an active problem.

 In January 2021, the Veteran underwent a second VA examination regarding his sleep apnea claim. The Veteran reported snoring, gasping and waking up with a choking sensation since being in service. See January 2021 Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The Veteran reported daytime fatigue and denied using a CPAP machine. Id. Relying on the November 2016 sleep study, the VA examiner indicated that there was no evidence of sleep disordered breathing. Id. Noting the AHI score of 1.24, the VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran had a current diagnosis of sleep apnea, explaining that there was no objective or clinical evidence of "a sleep apnea condition."  The Board observes that in during a mental disorder examination, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with insomnia which met the DSM-5 criteria for insomnia disorder, and chronic sleep impairment was subsumed as a symptom of the Veteran's subsequently service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). See January 2017 VA Mental Disorders DBQ.  

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in both January 2017 and January 2021; however, neither VA examiner provided adequate medical opinions for adjudicative purposes and cannot be assigned probative weight regarding the diagnosis of a current disability. Specifically, the January 2017 VA medical opinion provided insufficient analysis, concluding that the November 2016 sleep study's AHI findings did not meet the criteria for sleep apnea without any indication as to whether and AHI finding is the sole criteria for establishing a diagnosis of sleep apnea. Additionally, it is unclear whether the VA examiner had the benefit of the  sleep study and associated progress notes at the time of the January 2017 examination. 

The Board observes that the November 2016 sleep study was not associated with the Veteran's claims file until March 2017, two months after the VA examiner rendered the unfavorable medical opinion. Notably, the January 2017 VA sleep apnea DBQ states "As per Vet, he had a sleep study but it did not show sleep apnea." While the Veteran is competent to provide lay statements regarding his symptoms of sleep apnea, he is not competent provide evidence of more complex medical questions, whether his sleep study results indicated a diagnosis of sleep apnea. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007). Based on the evidence of record at the time of the 2017 VA medical opinion, it cannot be determined whether the VA examiner had the benefit of the November 2016 sleep study and instead relied on the Veteran's statements regarding what the substance of the sleep study.

Further, in both the January 2017 and January 2021 VA examinations, the VA examiners indicated that there were no other findings, signs or symptoms attributable to sleep apnea, despite the findings of the November 2016 sleep study and progress notes that included diagnoses of hypersomnia and snoring and noted narrowed hypopharynx, nor addressing the Veteran's reports of difficulty staying asleep, daytime fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep. At the January 2021 VA examination, the Veteran described symptoms of snoring, gasping and waking up with a choking sensation since being in service, however the VA examiner determined there was no current diagnosis as there was no clinical or objective evidence. 

Therefore, because the VA examiners failed to consider the Veteran's competent lay statements regarding sleep apnea symptoms and failed to reconcile the findings of the November 2016 diagnoses and documented symptomatology, the January 2017 and January 2021 VA medical opinions cannot be assigned probative weight. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that an examiner's opinion failed to consider whether lay statements presented sufficient evidence of the etiology of the Veteran's disability such that his claim could be proven without contemporaneous medical evidence); See also Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that an opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). 

The Board observes that the Veteran provided an independent medical opinion with the submission of his December 2020 supplemental claim application that determined the sleep study provided a diagnosis of sleep apnea and provided a favorable nexus opinion. See December 2020 independent medical opinion. However, while it appears that the Veteran had a physically examination, there is no indication that the examiner reviewed any medical records as it relates to the Veteran's sleep apnea. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating that "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion."). Regarding the medical nexus, the examiner opined that the onset of the condition "which persists to present during active-duty military service should qualify same for service connection." Unfortunately, this language is too speculative and cannot be afforded probative weight. Polovick v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 48, 54 (2009). 

The November 2016 sleep study and related progress notes are ambiguous as to a diagnosis of sleep apnea, as are subsequent VA treatment records, with a noted absence of records from July 2020 to January 2021. See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011) (stating that "[w]hen assessing a claim, the Board may not consider the absence of evidence as substantive negative evidence."). The VA medical opinions nor the independent medical opinion are not adequate for adjudicative purposes. Accordingly, affording the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that the ambiguity surrounding the Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea must be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The Veteran's diagnosis of sleep apnea was rendered during the pendency of the Veteran's claim that was filed in October 2016, shortly before the Veteran separated from service, and his symptoms of sleep apnea persisted through the appeal period. Further, the record reflects that the symptoms associated with the Veteran's sleep apnea have persisted during the appeal period, as indicated by the Veteran's complaints of current symptoms such has snoring, waking up choking and gasping for air, during his January 2021 VA examination. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability of sleep apnea, satisfying the first element for entitlement to service connection. 

Moving to the second element of service connection, the Board finds that the Veteran's diagnosed sleep apnea was incurred during service. The evidentiary record does not reflect complaints or treatment of symptoms associated with sleep apnea prior to the Veteran's entry into his military service. As discussed supra, the Veteran served in the Army from March 1995 to January 2017. See DD-214. As the Board has determined that the Veteran was diagnosed with sleep apnea in November 2016, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the second element for entitlement to service connection has been satisfied. 

Because the current disability of sleep apnea was diagnosed contemporaneously with the appeal period prior to separation from service, coupled with the documentation of persistent symptoms since its onset support the finding of a medical nexus between the Veteran's current disability of sleep apnea and incurrence during military service. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013). As such, the third element to establish service connection has been satisfied. 

While the record is devoid of adequate medical nexus opinions addressing the crux of the Veteran's appealed issue, the Board concludes that remand is unnecessary based on the evidence of record and would only result in avoidable delay without additional benefit flowing to the Veteran. Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540 (1991). Specifically, such medical opinions regarding the etiology of the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea are unnecessary since the disability, which remains current, initially manifested during active duty.  This fact, alone, suffices the medical nexus element.

Based on the foregoing and affording the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.
