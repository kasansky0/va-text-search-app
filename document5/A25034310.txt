REMANDED

Payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services provided on September 14, 2020, at a private hospital. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2010 to March 2014. 

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim apparently in October 2020 although the denial is not currently part of the record. In the November 2020, the Veteran appealed to the Board via a VA Form 10182 and elected the Evidence Submission docket. 

The Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to associate the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) claims file pertaining to the claim for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses incurred on September 14, 2020, with the electronic record.

Significantly, review of the available electronic record reveals the November 2020 VA Form 10182 as well as relevant medical records for the date of service submitted by the Veteran; however, all other relevant evidence has not been associated with the record. Specifically, the record does not contain the initial claim to VHA, VHA's denial letter, nor any other VHA records. 

The Board finds that remand to obtain and associate with the electronic record, the complete VHA claims file, including any VHA file evidence, to include VA treatment records, relevant private treatment and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran are necessary to determine whether entitlement to payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses incurred on September 14, 2020, is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Reconstruct the VHA claims file and associate it with the electronic record, to include obtaining any outstanding VHA file evidence such as the VA treatment records, relevant private treatment records and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran. 

In particular, the October 2020 AOJ decision cited in the Veteran's November 2020 notice of disagreement should be associated with the claims file.

2. The AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability if the records are unable to be obtained.
