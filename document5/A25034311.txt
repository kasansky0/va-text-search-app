ORDER

Entitlement to an extension of the delimiting date beyond August 21, 2022, for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Appellant, the Veteran's spouse, became eligible for DEA benefits on August 21, 2012, the date of marriage.

2. The record does not reflect the Appellant had a physical or mental disability that prevented her from using her DEA benefits under Chapter 35 prior to August 21, 2022; nor did she submit a timely request for an extension of her delimiting date and good cause has not been shown for extending the time limit for filing such a request.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to extension of delimiting date beyond August 21, 2022, for DEA benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 3512; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.1033, 21.3021, 21.3046, 21.3047.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1990 to March 1994.  The Appellant is the Veteran's spouse. 

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal was issued in March 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to extension of delimiting date beyond August 21, 2022, for DEA benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits can be established in several ways, including being the spouse of a veteran who has a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1)(D)(i); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a)(3)(i).  Here, the Appellant disagreed the AOJ decision to deny DEA educational benefits after 10 years of marriage implying that the delimiting date for such benefits should be extended.

The beginning date of eligibility for the spouse of a veteran with a permanent and total disability evaluation effective after November 30, 1968, is the effective date of the veteran's total and permanent rating, the date of notification of the total and permanent rating, or any date between the aforementioned dates, whichever is more advantageous to the spouse.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3512(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3046(a).

Educational assistance expires 10 years after one of the following occurs: (1) The date on which the Secretary first finds the spouse from whom eligibility is derived has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature; (2) the date of death of the spouse from whom eligibility is derived who dies while a total disability evaluated as permanent in nature was in existence; or (3) the date on which the Secretary determines that the spouse from whom eligibility is derived died of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3512(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a).

However, the 10-year delimiting period may be extended if the eligible spouse: (1) applies for the extension within the appropriate time limit; (2) was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the eligible spouse; (3) provides VA with any requested evidence tending to show that he/she was prevented from initiating or completing the program because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the eligible spouse; and (4) is otherwise eligible for payment of educational assistance for the training pursuant to Chapter 35.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3512(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3047(a)(i)-(iv).

In this case, a February 2002 rating decision determined the Veteran had a total service connected disability that became permanent in nature effective February 15, 2002.  As such, the February 2002 rating decision awarded the Veteran DEA education benefits effective February 15, 2002.  The Appellant and the Veteran were married on August 21, 2012.  See August 2012 marriage certificate.  As a result, the Appellant became eligible for DEA benefits on August 21, 2012, based on her marriage to the Veteran. 

In December 2019, the AOJ issued a certificate of eligibility notifying the Appellant that she was entitled to DEA educational benefits.  See December 2019 notification letter.  The AOJ informed the Appellant that she may only use the benefits before August 21, 2022, ten years from the date of her marriage to the Veteran.  Id.  She was informed that any remaining benefits could not be used for training on or after that date.  Id.

In March 2023, the Appellant applied for DEA educational benefits indicating she wanted to pursue a bachelor's degree in social work.  In the March 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the Appellant DEA education benefits noting that benefits could not be paid for any period after August 21, 2022.  

The Board agrees with the AOJ that the Appellant is not eligible for DEA benefits after August 21, 2022.  As noted, the Appellant did not apply for DEA benefits until March 2023.  Because the Appellant did not become eligible for DEA benefits until August 21, 2012, and did not file a claim for DEA benefits until March 2023, the Appellant's eligibility period is limited to 10 years from her beginning date.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3512(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a); 21.3046(c)(1)(i).  Additionally, the Appellant was informed that the ending date of DEA eligibility was August 21, 2022.  

Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that demonstrates the Appellant requested an extension or that she was prevented from initiating or completing a program of education because of her own physical or mental disability.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3046(c)(1)(i), 21.3047.  The record does not otherwise demonstrate, nor does the Appellant argue, that any other reasons for extension of the ending date are applicable in this case.  See 38 C.F.R. § 21.3046(c)(3) and (d).

The Board is sympathetic to the Appellant's contention.  However, the Board is bound by the applicable law and regulations and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994).

As outlined above, the evidence does not demonstrate the Appellant is entitled to an extension of the delimiting date for DEA educational benefits as she does not meet any exceptions to the 10-year delimiting period stemming from her marriage to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 3512; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.1033, 21.3021, 21.3046, 21.3047.  As such, the appeal must be denied.
