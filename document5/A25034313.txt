From May 12, 2021 to June 10, 2021, a 30 percent rating, but no higher for bilateral pes planus is granted.

From June 11, 2021, a rating in excess of 30 percent for bilateral pes planus is denied.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating (TDIU) based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. VA received an Intent to File a claim for compensation from the Veteran on June 10, 2021.

2. Prior to VA's receipt of his June 7, 2022, VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for entitlement to service connection for an PTSD, VA received the Veteran's December 2, 2021 VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim Application, as to other claims.  

3. Prior to May 12, 2021, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was not manifested by marked deformities, pain on manipulation, accentuated pain on use, swelling, or characteristic callosities.

4. From May 12, 2021, it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was manifested by bilateral foot swelling and bilateral characteristic calluses.

5. Over the entire appeal period, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was not manifested by marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces, marked inward displacement, or severe spasm of the tendo Achillis on manipulation.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date prior to June 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400; Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Prior to May 12, 2021, the criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of ten percent for bilateral pes planus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5276.

3. From May 12, 2021, the criteria for entitlement to an initial rating of 30 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral pes planus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5276.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1987 to September 2008.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 decision which addressed his pes planus claim.  In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2022 decision which addressed his PTSD claim.  In June 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2022 and September 2022 decisions.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 or April 2022 decisions.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 (pes planus) and September 2022 (PTSD) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 7, 2022 for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  

Generally, the effective date of an award of a service connection claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Generally, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a), 3.160.  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Effective on March 24, 2015, VA amended its rules as to what constitutes a claim for benefits; such now requires that claims be made on specific claim form prescribed by the Secretary.  This provision effectively removed informal claims from VA's processes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

A claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may indicate a claimant's desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Id.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form.  Id.  If VA receives a complete application form within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(i)-(iii) specifies that an intent to file be submitted (i) electronically, (ii) in writing on the paper intent to file form proscribed by VA and signed and dated, or (iii) orally communicated to VA personnel and recorded in writing.  Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file, and if multiple claims are filed within one year of an intent to file, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).

Before February 19, 2019, 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 explained the manner and methods in which a claim could be initiated and filed, to include an intent to file a claim.  After February 19, 2019, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 were amended; specifically, the provisions pertaining to an intent to file a claim were not applied to supplemental claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

However, since that time, the Federal Circuit held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent to file framework were invalid.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (hereinafter MVA).  Essentially, the Federal Circuit explained that it saw no basis to treat supplemental claims differently than other types of claims, for which the intent to file framework did apply, so its exclusion was arbitrary and capricious.  Id.

In the AMA system, an initial claim is a new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p)(1), 3.160(b).  A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p)(2); 3.2501.

The Veteran seeks an effective date for service connection, prior to June 7, 2022.  Review of the claims file shows, he filed an Intent to File notice on June 10, 2021.  On June 11, 2021, VA acknowledged receipt of this notice.  On December 2, 2021, he filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim seeking review of the issues of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus and the evaluation and effective date for service connection for bilateral pes planus.  Those claims had been most recently addressed in a June 2021 rating decision.  On June 7, 2022, the Veteran filed VA form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits seeking entitlement to service connection for PTSD.  

The Board finds, an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD is not warranted.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative's argument that the June 10, 2021 Intent to File preserved an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD.  In support, the representative asserts the December 2, 2021 Supplemental Claim, was timely filed as to December 9, 2020, February 1, 2021, and June 4, 2021 rating decisions which addressed the DM and pes planus claims.  Thus, he argues the June 10, 2021 Intent to file was "never used" to preserve any date of claim for the DM or pes planus issues which were the subject of the timely filed December 2, 2021 Supplemental Claim.  As a result, he contends the June 10, 2021 Intent to File was "still active" when the June 7, 2022 claim for service connection for PTSD was filed.  However, the Federal Circuit invalidated the portion of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent to file framework.  Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 excluding supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework is invalid for contravening the unambiguous meaning of their governing statutory provisions).  Therefore, because VA received the Veteran's VA 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, after his June 10, 2021 Intent to File and before his June 7, 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, the Intent to File attached to the December 2, 2021 Supplemental Claim and not to the subsequently filed VA Form 21-526EZ.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy, 7 F.4th at 1147.  Only one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file, and if multiple claims are filed within one year of an intent to file, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii).  Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

Entitlement to an increased initial rating for bilateral pes planus, currently rated as 10 percent disabling prior to June 11, 2021 and as 30 percent thereafter 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  When there is a question as to which of two ratings apply, VA will assign the higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Disabilities must be viewed in relation to their entire history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  VA is required to interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  VA is also required to evaluate functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness and the effects of the disabilities upon the claimant's ordinary activity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

The Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate determinations of competence, credibility, and weight.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Under 38 C.F.R. §4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276, for acquired flatfoot, a noncompensable rating is warranted for mild acquired flatfoot; symptoms relieved by built-up shoe or arch support.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate acquired flat foot; weight-bearing line over or medial to great toe, inward bowing of the tendo Achillis, pain on manipulation and use of the feet, bilateral or unilateral.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for severe unilateral acquired flat foot; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe bilateral acquired flat foot; objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indication of swelling on use, characteristic callosities.  A 30 percent rating is also warranted for pronounced unilateral acquired flatfoot; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo Achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.  A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for bilateral acquired flatfoot; marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo Achillis on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276.

The term "marked" is not defined in the regulation. When a regulation includes ambiguous or subjective terms, the Board must define such term.  See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018).  The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "marked" as "having a distinctive or emphasized character."  See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked (last visited April 4, 2025). 

In October 2020, the Veteran submitted a claim seeking service connection for right foot pes planus.  In January 2021, a VA foot conditions examination was provided.  The examiner evaluated the right foot.  At that time, the Veteran reported periodic throbbing right foot pain with numbness.  The examiner confirmed right foot pain with use.  There was no pain with manipulation, no swelling, no characteristic calluses, no extreme tenderness, no decreased longitudinal arch height, no marked deformity, no marked pronation, no weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, no inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, no marked inward displacement and no severe spasm of the Achilles tendon.  The examiner indicated the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks was limited by his pes planus because the condition made it difficult to walk and climb stairs.  

In March 2021, the Veteran filed a claim seeking entitlement to service connection for left foot pes planus.  On May 11, 2021, a second VA foot conditions examination was provided.  The examiner diagnosed bilateral pes planus.  He noted the Veteran's report of bilateral foot pain, left greater than right and onset over the previous "couple of years."  Right foot pain was intermittent, left foot pain was present "nearly every day."  Foot pain was associated with use of the feet and particularly with walking and climbing stairs.  There was decreased longitudinal arch height on both feet.  There was no pain with manipulation, no swelling, no characteristic calluses, no extreme tenderness, no marked deformity, no marked pronation, no weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, no inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, no marked inward displacement and no severe spasm of the Achilles tendon.  The examiner indicated the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks was limited by his pes planus because the condition rendered him unable to perform prolonged walking or standing.

In June 2021, a third VA foot conditions examination was provided.  The examiner diagnosed bilateral pes planus.  The examiner confirmed bilateral foot pain with use, bilateral foot swelling, bilateral characteristic calluses, and bilateral decreased longitudinal arch height.  There was no pain with manipulation, no extreme tenderness, no marked deformity, no marked pronation, no weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, no inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, no marked inward displacement and no severe spasm of the Achilles tendon.  

VA treatment records include a November 2020 rheumatology note documenting pes planus with a prior history of a broken right foot and the Veteran's use of custom orthotics.  A February 2022 podiatry note and x-ray evaluation confirm severe bilateral pes planus.  An April 2022 podiatry note documents the Veteran's report of foot pain over many years and the podiatrist's observation of decreased medial longitudinal arch with midfoot collapse and sagittal plane dominant pes planus.  

Here, the VA examinations and VA treatment records show, through May 11, 2021, the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was manifested by symptoms of pain on use of his feet and decreased longitudinal arch height.  There is no evidence of any additional symptoms which associated with a pes planus rating in excess of 10 percent.  Through May 11, 2021 a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276. 

The June 2021 VA examination confirmed the onset of additional symptoms of bilateral foot swelling and bilateral characteristic calluses.  Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds these additional symptoms were at least as likely as not present from May 12, 2021, the day following the second VA foot examination.  A 30 percent rating for bilateral pes planus is warranted from May 12, 2021.  Id.

Over the entire appeal period, there is no evidence of pronounced unilateral or bilateral acquired flatfoot with marked pronation, extreme tenderness of plantar surfaces, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo Achillis on manipulation.  A rating in excess of 30 percent for the pes planus disability is not warranted at any time.  Id.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TIDU) is remanded.  

Here, the evidence of record suggests the Veteran's bilateral pes planus disabilities impact his ability to perform occupational tasks.  Additional evidence, including an August 2022 VA PTSD examination indicates the Veteran is not employed.  Thus, entitlement to a TDIU is raised by the record as an element of the Veteran's increased rating appeal.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  Although an element of the present appeal, the AOJ must be provided the opportunity to develop and adjudicate the issue in the first instance to ensure the Veteran is afforded due process.  See Disabled Am. Veterans v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2003).   

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Develop and adjudicate the issue of entitlement to TDIU in accordance with Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009),
