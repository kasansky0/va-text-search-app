ORDER

From October 17, 2016, entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployment (TDIU) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, since October 17, 2016, the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU from October 17, 2016 to July 17, 2024 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16 (b).

2. The criteria for entitlement to a schedular TDIU have been met since July 18, 2024. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 ; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.1, 4.16, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from December 1964 to December 1966.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2024 decision.  In August 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2024 decision.  

In the September VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received his VA Form 10182, whichever date is later, unless the Veteran has requested to waive that right. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Although the Veteran has not requested to waive this right, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication as this decision constitutes a full grant of benefit sought.

Finally, this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c).

Entitlement to a TDIU from October 17, 2016.

The Veteran contends that his service-connected disabilities, specifically his service-connected migraine headaches, tinnitus, and deviated septum, prevent him from securing and following substantially gainful employment. See March 2023 VA Form 21-8940.

It is the established policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b).  The Board may not grant an extraschedular TDIU in the first instance.  The Director's decision is not evidence, but, rather, the de facto Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, and the Board must conduct de novo review of this decision.  Wages v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 233, 238-39 (2015) (holding that the Board conducts a de novo review of the Director's decision denying extraschedular consideration).  If the Board determines that an extraschedular TDIU is not warranted despite its earlier referral, it must provide an adequate statement of reasons and bases for its decision.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that substantially gainful employment, in the TDIU context, contains economic and noneconomic components; the economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person, while the noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. at 73. The CAVC also provided guidance as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment, noting that attention must be given to: the veteran's occupational history, education, skill and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform occupational activities; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform occupational activities.

A determination of whether a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability is a factual, rather than a medical, determination.  Therefore, VA is responsible for the ultimate decision of whether a veteran is capable of securing or following substantially gainful employment.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In adjudicating the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the Board may not consider any nonservice-connected disabilities or advancing age.  However, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be addressed.

Moreover, a request for TDIU " is not a separate claim for benefits, but rather involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability or disabilities, either as part of the initial adjudication of a claim... or as part of a claim for increased compensation." Rice v. Shinseki 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). The general rule with respect to the effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application thereof."  38 U.S.C. § § 5110 (a). 

In that vein, the Board recognizes a recent case wherein the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) found that, when a veteran seeks higher ratings for their service-connected disabilities by applying for a TDIU, the TDIU application (VA Form 21-8940) may serve as a supplemental claim in the AMA. See Chisholm v. Collins, __Vet. App.__, No. 22-7028 (March 13, 2025). 

The Veteran's March 2023 claim for a TDIU was filed during the one year subsequent to the October 2022 rating decision awarding him service-connection for migraine headaches. Thus, in light of both Rice and Chisolm, the Board finds the period on review for a TDIU is from October 17, 2016, the date of the service connection for migraine headaches. 

From October 17, 2016 to July 17, 2024, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities included migraine headaches at 50 percent, tinnitus at 10 percent, deviated nasal septum with non-allergic rhinitis at 10 percent, and right ear hearing loss at a noncompensable, or 0 percent, rating. His combined rating evaluation was 60 percent; thus, he did not meet the schedular requirements for a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). 

In February 2024, the Board remanded the claim for the AOJ to refer the appeal to the Director, Compensation Service for consideration of a TDIU on an extraschedular basis. In April 2024, as part of that process, the AOJ conducted an administrative review of the Veteran's claim. It concluded that, though the Veteran did not meet the schedular requirements for a TDIU at that time, the evidence showed that his service-connected migraines prevented him from securing and following substantially gainful employment; thus, the AOJ recommended a grant of a TDIU on an extraschedular basis. See April 2024 correspondence. In May 2024, the Director, Compensation Service disagreed, asserting that the "overall evidence fail[ed] to support an exceptional situation that prevents gainful employment." See May 2024 VA memo. 

In a recent March 2025 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for several scars, resulting in a combined evaluation of 70 percent, effective July 18, 2024. As such, the Veteran is found to have met the schedular requirements for a TDIU effective July 18, 2024. Absent clear and unmistakable evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. §3.104 (c).

Regarding the Veteran's employment history, educational and vocational attainment, the Veteran completed a high school education prior to serving in the U.S. Army; however, he did not obtain any additional education after that time. While in active service, the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was 11E, Armor Crewman. He was also awarded a Driver and Mechanic Badge. See DD Form 214.  Post-service medical records indicate that the Veteran worked for a grocery company for nearly 40 years prior to his retirement. See e.g., September 2022 VA examination. After his retirement, he enjoyed volunteering at his local chapter of Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and as a Veteran's Service Officer (VSO). See July 2015 VA treatment record. This is supported by the Veteran's March 2023 VA Form 21-8940 wherein he asserts he worked one hour a week as his county Veteran's Service Commissioner from August 2019 to February 2023; his annual income totaled $4800 for the prior year.

The medical evidence of record also reveals that the Veteran experienced chronic headaches for several years, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. See May 2016; October 2018; June 2019; August 2019 VA treatment records. An October 2018 VA treatment note indicates the Veteran reported a history of migraine headaches 2 or 3 times a week ever since his military day, with chronic intermittent severe vertigo with vomiting.  In October 2019 and March 2020, he reported episodes of tunnel vision in concert with his headaches. See October 2019; March 2020 VA treatment records.

Despite VA treatment records to the contrary, a January 2017 VA examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a diagnosable headache condition and that, consequently, headaches did not impact his ability to work. 

In August 2022, the Veteran reported that his headaches impaired his ability to use the toilet and decreased his mobility, quality of life, and enjoyment of activities. See August 2022 VA treatment record. 

A September 2022 VA examination reported the Veteran experienced throbbing pain on both sides of his head, lasting for 24 hours up to 3 days. The Veteran categorized the pain as being a "10" on a scale of 10, worsened by light and noise. He also stated he endured weekly flare-ups that occurred 1 to 3 or 4 times a month. During those times, he was unable to do basic activities such as walk, sit, bathe, and dress himself. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's "severe long episodes of headaches" impacted his ability to work and provide customer service, as was typical in his noted occupations. Thus, he concluded that the Veteran's headaches manifest as "very prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability." See September 2022 VA examination.  

In a November 2023 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he last worked for the grocery company in 2000. He reported that, as a supervisor, he could often relieve his migraines by going in the back cooler, turning off the lights, and sitting. However, he stated that he did not believe he could hold such a position now as his migraines have worsened. He experienced headaches 1 to 3 times per week and migraines 2 to 4 times a month, causing him stress and inducing light sensitivity. He stated his migraines could be debilitating and, consequently, he has to take several medications to manage the symptoms. Unfortunately, he stated, he was limited in using those medications at times due to his diagnosed kidney disease. He also described how he is no longer able to drive alone since, during onset of a headache, he has to pull over and cannot continue driving. Finally, the Veteran testified that his service-connected tinnitus wakes him up at times and prevents him falling back asleep, making him tired throughout the day. See November 2023 Board transcript.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the April 2024 AOJ administrative review that determined "the Veteran's service-connected disabilities [have precluded] him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment" since October 17, 2016, the date of he was granted service connection for migraine headaches. See April 2024 correspondence to be highly probative. 

Conversely, the Board finds that the Director of Compensation Service's May 2024 conclusion, that the Veteran's circumstances did not rise to an "exceptional basis" requiring extraschedular consideration, to be incomplete, as the Director did not provide sufficient rationale for her conclusion. Moreover, there is no requirement that a fact-pattern be found "exceptional" to meet extraschedular criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (b). As such, the Board does not find the Director's opinion adequate and, as it is not bound by the Director's findings, affords the opinion no probative value.

Rather, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran and resolving any reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities, primarily his service-connected migraine headaches, since October 17, 2016.  The Veteran's VA treatment records indicate treatment for his severe migraine headaches from a neurologist since at least 2016.  Moreover, the evidence confirms that the frequency, duration, and severity of his migraine headaches results in very frequent, completely prostrating and prolonged attacks at least 2 to 4 times a month, causing him stress and inducing light sensitivity.  In addition, he must lie in a dark room for up to a day and half when his severe migraine symptoms occur.  His treatment records, testimony, VA examinations, coupled with a 50 percent rating throughout the period on appeal, also indicate that his symptoms have remained essentially the same since service connection for his migraine headaches was granted.  Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU from October 17, 2016 is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021).
