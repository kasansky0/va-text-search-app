REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1974 to October 1977.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease with hypertension and congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, peripheral neuropathy, upper and lower extremities, bilateral hearing loss, and tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102(c)(2)(ii).

The Board acknowledges that the time period for requesting a docket change has not expired. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case for further development including obtaining records in the possession of the federal government and obtaining an adequate medical opinion. Neither the Veteran nor his representative has provided any indication of a desire to present further evidence and/or information. Rather, the Veteran's representative cited reasons why it deemed a VA examination to be inadequate. The Board finds no prejudicial harm to the Veteran in expediting a remand in this case. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for coronary artery disease with hypertension and congestive heart failure is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, upper and lower extremities is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a presumption of herbicide exposure due to service in Vietnam with the 81 Security Police Squadron. See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. In the May 2024 rating decision, the AOJ could not find evidence of the Veteran's service in Vietnam after a review of the evidence of record and determined that the Veteran did not participate in a toxic exposure risk activity. See May 2024 Rating Decision.

Under AMA, the Board is responsible for identifying duty to assist errors that were made by the AOJ, prior to the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c). Once identified, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Although the AOJ requested the Veteran's personnel file, it did not request the unit records for the Veteran's unit. These records may document the Veteran's alleged service in Vietnam. As such, the Board finds a remand is necessary to fulfill the regulatory duty to obtain relevant service department records. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.802(a), 3.159(c)(2).

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss. He contends that his current hearing loss disability was caused by in-service noise exposure to gunfire. See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim. The AOJ has conceded noise exposure based on the Veteran's MOS of Security Specialist as a Dog Handler. See May 2024 Rating Decision. After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds it necessary to remand to remedy a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran was afforded a VA medical examination in May 2024. See May 2024 C&P Examination. The VA examiner determined that there was no significant shift in hearing thresholds after reviewing the Veteran's service treatment records. From this determination, the VA examiner concluded that there was no evidence of permanent auditory damage on active duty from the conceded noise exposure. 

The Veteran's service treatment records contain two audiometric readings from February 1974 and July 1975. See November 2023 Service Treatment Records. In the February 1974 entrance audiogram, the Veteran's puretone thresholds at 6000 Hertz were 25 and 30 decibels in the right and left ear, respectively. In the July 1975 reference audiogram, the Veteran's puretone thresholds at 6000 Hertz were 45 and 55 decibels in the right and left ear, respectively. The May 2024 VA examination did not discuss this 20-decibel shift. 

As the May 2024 VA examination did not consider the 20-decibel shift at 6000 Hertz, the Board finds the examination to be inadequate and assigns it no probative value in determining the etiology of the Veteran's current hearing disability. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) ("An opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value."). As there is no adequate medical opinion concerning the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss a remand is required. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).

5. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.

The Board notes that the May 2024 VA examination concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not a symptom associated with the Veteran's hearing loss because tinnitus is known to be a symptom associated with hearing loss. See May 2024 C&P Examination. Thus, if service connection is granted for the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss, then service connection may also be warranted for tinnitus based on a secondary theory of entitlement. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Accordingly, the claims are inextricably intertwined. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991). Accordingly, adjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is deferred.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Request the Veteran's unit records from the 81 Security Police Squadron from February 1974 to February 1976, from all appropriate sources in order to confirm the Veteran's contention of service in DaNang, Vietnam. 

Make as many requests as necessary to obtain the records. If unable to obtain any of the requested records, please make a formal finding of unavailability and associate it with the claims file.

2.  Forward the Veteran's claims file to an appropriate examiner to determine the etiology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss. The claims file should be reviewed in conjunction with rendering the opinion. Upon review of the record, the examiner should answer the following questions:

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss arose in service or is etiologically related to the acoustic trauma the Veteran suffered during service?

(b)	Please define and explain the significance of a "significant threshold shift" and determine whether the evidence of record shows such a shift occurred during the Veteran's service, to include the range of 6000 Hz.

(Continued on the next page)

?

(c)	Please discuss the results of the February 1974 and July 1975 audiometric readings and, specifically, the significance of the 20-decibel shift in the right ear and 25-decibel shift in the left ear in the range of 6000 Hz in terms of evidence of acoustic trauma and demonstrating a causal link to the current hearing loss disability.

Any opinion expressed must be accompanied by a complete rationale. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion that fact must be stated and the reasons why an opinion cannot be provided explained. That is, the examiner must specifically explain why causation of any hearing loss is unknowable.
