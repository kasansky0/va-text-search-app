ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 29, 2014, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim seeking (in pertinent part) entitlement to service connection for headaches was received on August 10, 2011, and unemployability has been raised in conjunction with this claim.

2. From August 10, 2011, to October 29, 2014, it is not factually ascertainable that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities.

3. The weight of the probative evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for the assignment of a TDIU prior to the October 29, 2014, effective date.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than October 29, 2014, for the award of TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1973 to October 1975.

By way of background, in an August 2021 decision issued under the legacy appeals system, the Board (in pertinent part) granted service connection for headaches and remanded a claim for TDIU for additional development. A September 2021 rating decision implemented the Board's decision by granting service connection for headaches, rated 30 percent, effective August 10, 2011 (date of claim). A subsequent May 2022 rating decision continued to implement the Board's decision by awarding a 50 percent rating for the Veteran's headaches, effective September 16, 2021. The Veteran was notified of this May 2022 rating decision in July 2022.

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2022 rating decision (for which the Veteran had received notification in July 2022) contending that the 50 percent rating awarded therein should have been awarded effective August 10, 2011. 

In August 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) addressed the July 2022 Request for HLR by issuing a rating decision that granted a 50 percent rating for headaches, effective August 10, 2011, and also determined that a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher-level review for the issue of entitlement to TDIU. Specifically, it was noted that although a claim for TDIU was being separately addressed already, it had also been raised as part of the rating claim for the headaches. Accordingly, a claim for TDIU would be considered in conjunction with the request for a higher rating for headaches. See August 2022 VA Form 20-0999, Higher-Level Review Return.

While the higher-level review for the issue of entitlement to TDIU was pending under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the AOJ addressed the separate claim for TDIU that the Board had remanded under the legacy appeals system in August 2021. In this August 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to TDIU, effective October 29, 2014.  

As the Veteran had already been awarded entitlement to TDIU by the time the AOJ completed its development for the July 2022 Request for HLR (as it related to the TDIU issue), in the August 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ addressed the question of whether entitlement to TDIU prior to October 29, 2014, was warranted and denied entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU.

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Date for TDIU

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a), (b). 

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Regulations in effect prior to March 24, 2015, as is pertinent here, defined a "claim" as a "formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). An informal claim was any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits, and identifying the benefit sought from a claimant, his or her authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year after the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Thus, the essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are (1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as an application or claim for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits. See Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).

In this case, the Veteran has appealed the effective date awarded for TDIU. It is argued that the Veteran's TDIU claim is inferred from a headaches claim filed on August 10, 2011. The Veteran's attorney stated: 

Since that date, the Veteran has maintained a combined rating of at least 60% with individual ratings of 50% for headaches with tinnitus, 10% for tinnitus associated with bilateral hearing loss, and 0% for bilateral hearing loss. Because all of these service-connected disabilities share a common etiology of bilateral hearing loss, the Veteran's ratings have met the threshold percentage requirement to establish eligibility for a schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (2023). 

See October 2023 brief from the Veteran's attorney. He also stated that the Veteran had reported not working since June 2008 because of his service-connected headaches. Id.

In this case, the record reflects that VA received an informal claim in August 2011, wherein the Veteran (in pertinent part) requested to reopen a previously denied claim for service connection for headaches. See August 2011 VA Form 21-4138. Service connection for headaches was subsequently granted, effective August 10, 2011, and as discussed in the Introduction, unemployability has been raised in conjunction with the initial rating of this claim, see Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009). Specifically, October 2016 correspondence from the Veteran's private physician indicated that the Veteran was not employable due to his service-connected bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus and his claimed headaches and anxiety disorder. Review of the claims file reflects that the record contains no record of a formal or informal claim for TDIU received prior to August 10, 2011. Moreover, the claims file reflects that service connection is not in effect for any disability prior to August 10, 2011.

As also discussed above, the Veteran has been awarded entitlement to TDIU and assigned an effective date of October 29, 2014. See August 2022 rating decision. Having determined the TDIU claim has been pending since August 10, 2011, the Board must determine whether from that date to October 29, 2014, the evidence supports a finding that entitlement arose for the assignment of a TDIU such that an earlier effective date for his TDIU rating may be awarded.

For the period from August 10, 2011, to October 29, 2014, the Veteran was service-connected for the following disabilities: bilateral hearing loss, rated 0 percent disabling; tinnitus associated with bilateral hearing loss, rated 10 percent disabling; and headaches associated with tinnitus, rated 50 percent disabling. His combined disability rating was 60 percent from August 10, 2011, to October 29, 2014. Disabilities resulting from common etiology, as here, will be considered as one disability for the above purposes of one 60 percent disability. As these disabilities all essentially have a common etiology, their ratings combine to 60 percent, and the Veteran's service-connected disabilities met the schedular criteria for a TDIU during the entire period from August 10, 2011, to October 29, 2014. 

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded gainful employment for which his education and occupational experience would have otherwise qualified him at any point earlier than October 29, 2014.

The Veteran's application for a total disability rating reflects his reports that he graduated from high school and last worked as a painter on June 8, 2008, for a school district. The Veteran reported that he became too disabled to work as of June 8, 2008. Based on his reports, he worked 40 hours per week from 1978 to 2008, and he made $46,000 in 2006. He also reported he was "retired" and did not list the specific service-connected disabilities preventing him from working. See July 2022 TDIU Application. 

In August 2022, the school district that employed the Veteran reported he worked as a painter through April 23, 2012, at which point he retired. He earned $45,784.08 in the 12 months prior to his retirement. See August 2022 VA Form 21-4192. According to the Census Bureau, the 2011 poverty threshold for one person was $12,071 and the threshold for 2012 was $12,082. Therefore, the Veteran's income exceeded the poverty line for this period and his employment was not considered marginal pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The medical evidence includes a February 2012 VA Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), which notes the Veteran's complaints of difficulty hearing people call him from a distance. He also reported having to keep the television volume loud.

An April 2013 VA treatment record shows the Veteran was seen with a request for Percocet for the "bad headache" he had that day. The treatment provider noted the Veteran was being seen by a pain management provider and was on Lortab. When asked about this, the Veteran stated he was unable to see his pain management provider until next month. On examination, the Veteran had no focal deficits, to include visual changes. An October 2013 VA treatment record shows the Veteran denied headaches on examination.

In May 2017, the Board received a September 2016 residual functional capacity evaluation completed by Dr. AA. The report states the Veteran would not be able to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his headaches and their effects. He would miss work or need to leave work early three days or more days per month due to headaches. He would also fail to stay focused for at least seven hours of an eight-hour workday. A September 2016 Headaches DBQ completed by Dr. HS notes the Veteran's diagnosis of migraines. The Veteran reported his migraines had increased in frequency and severity, to include head pain, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. He reported prostrating attacks that occurred more frequently than once a month. Dr. HS opined the Veteran would not be able to maintain substantial gainful employment due to his headaches.

In May 2017, the Board also received an unsigned October 2016 medical opinion (the Veteran's attorney has stated this opinion is from RW, PsyD, LMCH, LPCC). After reviewing the claims file and interviewing the Veteran, this clinician opined the Veteran's tinnitus, hearing loss, and headaches were preventing him from maintaining substantially gainful employment. He stated that the Veteran's symptom complex, including psychiatric symptoms, related back to October 2014. He essentially opined the Veteran's hearing loss, tinnitus and headaches caused the Veteran's anxiety disorder, which in turn caused symptoms such as sleep problems, and social isolation.

Also of record are statements received from the Veteran and his sister in March 2021. Both the Veteran and his sister essentially stated that the Veteran was unable to work, at least in part, because of his psychiatric disability. (The Board notes, however, that the Veteran was not awarded service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder until October 29, 2014. See June 2020 Rating Decision.) The Veteran's sister stated the Veteran:

couldn't function right on the job so he would call in. His headaches and pain worsen his anxiety because he is a perfectionist, and he wasn't able to do the job perfect anymore. Not being able to maintain his perfect work performance impacted his motivation and depression. He needs everything in a certain order, done a certain way and in a certain place and he just can't handle not doing a job perfect, so he stopped working because not doing a perfect job was just making his anxiety worse day by day.

In spite of the Veteran's and his sister's reports, however, the Board finds that, prior to October 29, 2014, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities (headaches, hearing loss, and tinnitus) did not render him unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation and entitlement to a TDIU is not warranted.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim for an effective date prior to October 29, 2014, for a TDIU. As reflected above, the record does not show that the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his headaches, hearing loss, and tinnitus, alone, from August 10, 2011, to October 29, 2014. The Veteran states he stopped working in June 2008; however, employer records show he worked up until April 23, 2012, and such work has not been considered marginal employment. Moreover, although the record shows the Veteran stopped working at his painting job on April 23, 2012, the more probative evidence of record reflects that he was at least capable of performing the physical and mental acts required for a job.

Notably, the Veteran states that when he stopped working it was due to both his anxiety and headaches. He also stated that his headaches and orthopedic pain had made his anxiety worse and as his anxiety worsened, so too did the shaking in his hands. This made it difficult to do a perfect job at work and that stressed him out and caused him to be more anxious because he wanted to be perfect. See March 2021 Correspondence. The Board is sympathetic and does not wish to minimize the nature and extent of the Veteran's limitation due to his service-connected headaches; however, the weight of the evidence does not support a finding that his service-connected headaches alone (or in consideration with his hearing loss and tinnitus) was sufficient to produce unemployability prior to October 29, 2014.  Rather, the evidence shows he could not work also in part because of psychiatric and orthopedic issues and the Veteran was not service-connected for an unspecified anxiety disorder, right shoulder disability, and a cervical spine disability until October 29, 2014.  The Board highlights as an example that when the Veteran was treated for headaches in April 2013, he had no focal deficits or visual changes, and he also denied headaches in October 2013. This is contrasted with the symptomatology shown during a September 2016 Headaches DBQ wherein the Veteran reported an increase in his migraines symptoms as he now had head pain, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Such evidence supports a finding that prior to October 29, 2014, the Veteran's headaches disability, by itself (or in consideration with his hearing loss and tinnitus), was not sufficient to produce unemployability.

When applying the default rule for effective dates, the Board also finds that there can be no earlier effective date than the currently assigned effective date of October 29, 2014. As indicated, generally, the effective date to be assigned is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In this case, the Veteran's claim was received on August 10, 2011, and as explained above, the record reflects that he was capable of meeting the mental and physical demands of a substantial gainful employment prior to the October 29, 2014, effective date of his award of TDIU. It was not until 2016 that evidence of an inability to maintain substantially gainful employment is shown. Accordingly, the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU arose sometime after October 29, 2014, and an earlier effective date is not warranted in this case.
