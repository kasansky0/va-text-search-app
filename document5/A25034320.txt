ORDER

New and relevant evidence (NRE) has been received to readjudicate the claims of service connection for the left elbow, low back and right knee conditions.  

Entitlement to service connection for left elbow condition is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for low back condition is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition is granted. 

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left elbow, right knee, and lumbar spine condition in a February 2023 rating decision.

2. Evidence received after the February 2023 rating decision included independent medical nexus opinions for the left elbow, right knee and lumbar spine and these opinions tended to prove the claim for service connection for these three injuries. 

3. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran had left elbow pain in service which continued since separation from service.  

4. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran had low back pain in service which continued since separation from service.  

5. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs in favor of a finding that the Veteran had right knee pain in service which continued since separation from service.  

6. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran's DMII was incurred in service or causally connected to service. 

7. The persuasive weight of the evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran's hypertension was incurred in service or causally connected to service.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1976 until July 1979.  She was honorably discharged from service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) AOJ, which denied a supplemental claim for service connection for elbow, knee and back conditions asserting the evidence submitted was not NRE. A separate February 2024 rating decision denied service connection for DMII and hypertension. In June 2023, the Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review (HLR) with respect to the DMII and hypertension rating. During the HLR, a duty to assist error was discovered in that a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) memorandum had not been requested. To consider the TERA memorandum, that claim was assigned to the supplemental review lane for additional development. 

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) appealing the issues of service connection for knee, elbow and lumbar spine conditions, as well as for DMII and hypertension. The NOD requested the direct review docket with review by a Veterans Law Judge. Accordingly, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran's August 2024 NOD also listed conditions that were denied in 2004, 2013, 2016 and refiled in a July 2022 claim. These conditions may have been inadvertently added to the Veteran's NOD.  Also, for the avoidance of doubt, the Board notes that the July 2022 claim included DMII, hypertension and 12 other conditions denied in September 2022. The Veteran requested a HLR for DMII and HTN in June 2023. As the Veteran did not appeal these 12 other conditions within one year, such an appeal would be untimely as the decision for those 12 conditions was addressed in a September 2022 rating decision. Thus, the decision for those 12 conditions became final and are not currently before the Board.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

1. NRE was received which warrants readjudication of the claims for service connection for the left elbow, right knee and lumbar spine conditions. 

VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "New" evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue, including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  Id. 

In February 2023, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for left elbow, right knee and low back conditions. In September 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim and included a private and separate nexus opinion for each of these conditions and a statement in support of her claim for each condition, i.e., the knee, elbow and lumbar spine. The private medical nexus opinion also referenced and included medical article excerpts and citations to support the nexus opinions rendered. These nexus opinions were dated August and September 2023, and the three statements were received September 2023.  None of these documents were previously in the record. Therefore, these three nexus opinions and three statements were all new evidence.  

The nexus opinions are relevant in that they confirmed the link between the Veteran's three conditions and the respective inservice injury for each of those conditions. The statements submitted by the Veteran for each condition confirm that she experienced pain in service from each of these three injuries which continued after her separation from service until the present time. Thus, the information in these documents is relevant in that they prove the matters in issue.   

Accordingly, the Board finds new and relevant evidence was received.  Therefore, readjudication of the claim for the Veteran's elbow, knee and lumbar spine is warranted. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Certain chronic diseases may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period following separation from service (generally one year). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. For chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), nexus to service may be established by showing continuity of symptomatology since service. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Arthritis is considered a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a).  Spondylosis is defined as degenerative spinal changes due to osteoarthritis (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 32nd ed., 2012).  Therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) for "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuous" post-service symptoms apply. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

For a showing of a chronic disease in service, the mere use of the word "chronic" will not suffice; rather, there is a required combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Continuity of symptomatology after service is required where a condition noted during service is not, in fact, chronic, or where a diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned. Id. The presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuity of symptomatology" after service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) have been interpreted as an alternative to service connection only for the specific chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). See Walker v. Shinseki, 718 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that the "chronic" in service and "continuous" post-service symptom presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) only apply to "chronic" diseases at 3.309(a)).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (addressing lay evidence as potentially competent to support presence of disability even where not corroborated by contemporaneous medical evidence).

Depending on the evidence and the contentions of record in a particular case, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis and medical etiology of a condition. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002). Lay testimony is not competent to determine the extent or etiology of  matters which require medical testing and expertise to determine. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011).

The claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a).  The VA shall consider all information, including lay and medical evidence of record.  VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) 

The Board will consider if the criteria for service connection have been met:

2. Entitlement to service connection for left elbow condition is granted.

The February 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of medial epicondylitis. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the second element of service connection is satisfied.  

The second element of service connection is an inservice injury or illness. The Veteran submitted a September 2023 statement in support of her claim. The Veteran stated that she injured her left elbow as a result of physical training exercises and lifting requirements. She stated that she strained herself several times and was reluctant to go to sick call and risk being considered weak. The February 2024 VA elbow examiner noted that the Veteran stated she injured her left elbow in basic training when she fell 10 feet. The Veteran advised the examiner that she was not seen at a clinic during basic training but when she was stationed at Fort Monroe she was seen and again in 1979 at the Fayetteville, North Carolina, VA. She also remembered doing physical therapy at the Fayetteville VA. 

The examiner noted that there were not any service treatment records (STRs) that referenced a left elbow injury. The Board notes that there was a May 1977 and June 1977 STR referencing wart removal on the left forearm.  A week later, another June 1977 STR referenced a lesion on the left forearm. It is unclear if these are the same occurrences or different. In any event, there were no STRS specifically referencing a left elbow injury. Nonetheless, the Board has no reason to doubt the credibility of the Veteran with regard to an elbow injury during basic training. Thus, the Board finds the second element of service connection, an in-service injury, is satisfied. 

The third element of service connection is a nexus between the current elbow epicondylitis and the in-service injury. The Veteran stated in her September 2023 statement that the elbow pain she had on active duty continued since separation from active duty.  She noted that the elbow became worse if she lifted, pushed or reached overhead. 

The September 2023 private nexus opinion cited a medical article that stated that 40 percent of all sports injuries were related to the elbow, causing destruction of the joint and soft tissues. If elbow injuries were not properly addressed or treated, the patient often developed chronic pain, joint laxity, instability and cartilage injury. The private nexus examiner opined that the current diagnosis correlated with the active-duty mechanism of injury/event. The medical literature supported that the elbow is a unique joint of the upper extremity and due to the pronation and supination of the forearm and the joint and surrounding structures were prone to injury, leading to instability, chronic pain, and functional loss. The opinion stated that it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's current left elbow strain condition is due to or related to progression of the inservice elbow injury. 

Conversely, the September 2024 VA elbow examiner noted that a chronic or acute elbow condition could not be established as there were not any STRs nor medical treatment records proximate to discharge. The examiner concluded that based on the available data, the current left elbow condition is less likely than not related to active-duty service. While a lack of STRs for an elbow injury is relevant, it is not dispositive. Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the injury and or disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

The Board has no reason to doubt the credibility or competence of either examiner. One opinion relied on the Veteran's assertions as to when the injury occurred and that the left elbow pain began on active duty and has continued ever since separation from service. The VA opinion relied on the lack of evidence and did not consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding her injury.  Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability that are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153 (a).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. In this case, there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of the nexus between the in-service injury and the current left elbow condition. As the nexus is an issue material to the determination of this claim, the benefit of the doubt in resolving this issue shall be given to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Accordingly, the Board gives the Veteran the benefit of every reasonable doubt and finds that the third element of service connection has been satisfied. 

Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's left elbow condition is related to her active-duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The approximate balance of the evidence is in favor of the Veteran's claim of service connection for a left elbow condition.  As such, that doctrine is applicable in the instant appeal, and her claim must be granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine condition is granted.

The February 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of lumbar spine degenerative disc disease. The Board notes that the February 2024 VA thoracolumbar spine examiner also diagnosed spondylolisthesis. The rating decision also conceded the second element of service connection, a qualifying event, injury, or disease which had its onset in service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first and second elements of  service connection are satisfied.

The third element of service connection is a nexus between the lumbar spine degenerative disc disease and spondylolisthesis to the in-service injury. In the Veteran's November 2022 statement in support of her claim, the Veteran stated that she had back surgery in 2002 and was diagnosed with spinal stenosis. In the Veteran's September 2023 statement in support of her claim she stated that since separating from active duty she has had varying degrees of pain in her lower back. She described the pain as throbbing, aching, and burning with shooting pains and muscle spasms. 

The August 2023 private nexus opinion cited several medical articles to support the nexus opinion. One medical article noted that the spondylolysis often begins as repetitive motions microtrauma and disc slippage at a younger age with the progression from spondylolysis to spondylolisthesis over a period of 20 to 40 years. Another article cited in the opinion noted that torsional trauma is the most disruptive, such as rotation outside the normal range of motion from repeated twisting, which was common in military work. The nexus opinion noted that the current diagnosis spondylolistheses at L4 -L5 correlated with documented symptoms in service. The medical literature supported that pain arises from inflammation and the inflammatory response from overuse, repetitive motion, and microtrauma has been strongly implicated the pathogenesis of arthritis.

The nexus opinion concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current chronic lumbar spine condition to include spondylolisthesis at L4-L5 is due to, related to, a progression of and or continuation of back overuse which occurred during active-duty service.

The February 2024 VA thoracolumbar spine examination report noted there was not a chronic back condition during active duty and there was only one STR reflecting back pain which was in 1978. The December 1978 STR noted the Veteran had fallen down on a waxed floor and had right side lumbar region pain. The examiner did not address the Veteran's statement that she did not always seek medical treatment while on active duty for fear of looking weak. 

The examiner also did not address the Veteran's written statements in support of her claim which described the repetitive activities the Veteran participated in while on active duty. In her November 2022 statement to support her claim, the Veteran  asserted that her back pain also resulted from carrying heavy sandbags, field exercises, and hiking and that she sought medical care after service. In her September 2023 statement, the Veteran noted the activities in her November 2022 statement and further noted that she was required to participate in physical training which included running, long marches carrying heavy rucksacks over uneven terrain and heavy lifting. 

The February 2024 opinion did not address the private examiner's opinion which cited medical articles opining on the nexus between repetitive use, including the rigors of military service, and back injuries. 

The Board has no reason to doubt the credibility or competency of either examiner.  The February 2024 examiner noted there was no data proximate to service for back pain. The examiner opined that it was less likely as not that the current back condition related to active-duty service. The VA examiner opinion has no probative weight or evidentiary value because the opinion did not address the Veteran's written descriptions of her active-duty physical requirements or the long-term effect from those requirements, and did not address the private opinion which relied on medical literature to support the conclusions in the nexus opinion.

The Board gives significant probative value and evidentiary weight to the private examiner opinion because the private examiner addressed the Veteran's condition in the context of military life and cited to medical articles which noted the effects of repetitive overuse. Accordingly, the Board finds the third element of service connection has been satisfied. 

The Board notes that the claim may also be granted on a presumptive basis. As noted above, certain chronic diseases, like arthritis, may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period following separation from service (generally one year). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  As the Veteran stated that her back pain began in service and continued after service, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuity of symptomatology" after service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) are applicable in this case. 

As all three elements of service connection have been satisfied, the Board finds that the Veteran's lumbar spine condition is related to her active-duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The approximate balance of the evidence is in favor of the Veteran's claim of service connection for her lumbar spine condition.  As such, that doctrine is applicable in the instant appeal, and her claim must be granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra. 

4.  Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is granted.

The February 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of right knee osteoarthritis with shin splints. The rating decision also conceded the second element of service connection, a qualifying event, injury, or disease which had its onset in service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first and second elements of service connection are satisfied.

The third element of service connection is a nexus between the current knee condition and the inservice injury. The Veteran noted in her November 2022 statement in support of her knee claim that she has had issues with her right knee since separation from service to include pain with motion, swelling, a feeling of the knee giving out, and popping. The pain caused her to walk unevenly and shift her weight from side to side.  Certain activities increased the knee pain to include stair climbing, prolonged walking, prolonged sitting, and exercise. 

In the Veteran's September 2023 statement in support of her claim she explained the type of inservice activities which caused her knee pain and strain. During service the Veteran participated in physical training, running, and long marches carrying heavy rucksacks over uneven terrain in combat boots without proper support. She also reiterated the current limitations imposed by her knee condition. 

The December 2022 VA knee examination report noted that the Veteran's shin splints were noted in 1976 but that there were no other knee injuries in the STRs. The December 2022 nexus opinion stated that the Veteran's claim of right knee pain due to degenerative joint disease (DJD) is less likely than not caused by the diagnosed mild shin splints in service in October 1976 since shin splints do not lead to DJD. The fact that 45 years have passed and the fact that the DJD is bilateral confirms it is an aging wear and tear condition. Therefore, it is less likely than not that the current knee condition was caused by the in-service injury.

First, the December 2022 VA examiner did not consider that the 1976 STRs reflected a bilateral condition and specifically noted possible stress reactions bilaterally. The Veteran had three STRs in October 1976. The first October 1976 STR noted that for the third week the Veteran had constant right leg pain with running and marching and that her leg "gave out on her." A week later in October 1976, the STR noted tibial flare, posterior medial tibia crest tenderness; mild soreness right posterior hamstring soreness, strain right knee; possible tibial stress reactions bilaterally, shin splints. The inservice knee examination was within normal limits bilaterally with mild soreness posteriorly on right hamstring tendons. The impressions were mild hamstring strain, soreness right knee. The Veteran's STRs indicate that in service there was a bilateral issue which appeared to be more significant on the right side and also reflected a right knee issue.  

Second, the December 2022 VA examiner did not consider the Veteran's written statements describing her active-duty physical requirements and did not opine on the potential effects of those physical requirements.  Third, the examiner placed emphasis on the fact that there were not a lot of STRs reflecting knee and or shin splint pain. The Veteran previously noted that she was reluctant to seek medical care on active duty for fear of appearing weak. This concern is reflected in the fact that the first STR for "right leg pain," reflected she had the pain for three weeks before seeking treatment. For these three reasons, the December 2022 VA nexus opinion has no probative value and no evidentiary weight. 

The September 2023 private opinion cited a medical article which noted that the relative risk for developing knee osteoarthritis was fivefold higher in patients who suffered a knee injury or from repetitive motion microtrauma. The article further noted that the biomechanical changes lead to joint degeneration due to degradation of articular cartilage with subchondral lesions and osteophyte formation. Another article cited confirmed that repetitive overuse injuries are significant causes of knee osteoarthritis. The private nexus opinion stated it was at least as likely as not that Veteran's current right knee osteoarthritis with shin splints is due to or related to a progression of, and or continuation of her right knee overuse injury that occurred during active-duty military service. This nexus opinion has high probative value with significant evidentiary weight because it considered the Veteran's statements that she had pain on active duty which continued since separation from active duty, considered the repetitive and physical rigor of the Veteran's active-duty service, and cited to medical literature to support the nexus opinion. 

The February 2024 VA nexus opinion noted that the Veteran did not have any complaints during active duty for right knee pain, and the condition was likewise not noted on the Veteran's 1978 examination or 1979 separation examination. The examiner concluded that there was no acute or chronic knee condition during active duty nor proximate to discharge. The examiner was unable to establish a nexus between the right knee and service based on data available and opined that the current right knee condition was less likely than not related to active-duty service. This examiner did not consider the medical articles referenced in the private nexus opinion which offer a potential explanation for a nexus based on medical literature. Additionally, the opinion did not address Veteran's statements submitted to support her claim or the potential effect of the physical requirements she noted in her statements would have on her condition.  Accordingly, the February 2024 VA nexus opinion has no probative value and no evidentiary weight.    

While the Board has no reason to doubt the competency or credibility of the three examiners providing nexus opinions, the probative value and evidentiary weight of each varies greatly as noted above. Based on the private nexus opinion, the Board finds the third element of service connection, the nexus requirement is satisfied. 

The Board notes that the claim may also be granted on a presumptive basis. As noted above, certain chronic diseases, like arthritis, may be service connected on a presumptive basis if manifested to a compensable degree within a specified period following separation from service (generally one year). 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  As the Veteran stated that her knee pain began in service and continued after service, the presumptive service connection provisions based on "chronic" in-service symptoms and "continuity of symptomatology" after service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) are applicable in this case. 

As all three elements of service connection have been satisfied, the Board finds that the Veteran's right knee condition is related to her active-duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The approximate balance of the evidence is in favor of the Veteran's claim of service connection for her right knee condition.  As such, that doctrine is applicable in the instant appeal, and her claim must be granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra. 

5.  Entitlement to service connection for DMII is denied. 

The February 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of DMII. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first element of service connection is satisfied.

The second element of service connection is an in-service event resulting in the current disability or inservice illness or disease. There is no evidence that the Veteran had DMII while on active duty. The Veteran's military personnel records reflected she was stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, Fort Monroe, Virginia, and in Germany. The October 2023 TERA Memorandum reflected that the Veteran did not participate in any TERA activities while on active duty.  

The Veteran's VA treatment records reflect the Veteran's DMII was diagnosed either in 2021 or 2022. See VA treatment records for December 2021, noting current use of oral hypoglycemic drugs; March 2022 noting the Veteran denied having DMII; June 2022 reflecting the Veteran had DMII without complication; and September 2023 noting DMII without complications. In any event, the diagnosis is approximately 40 years after the Veteran separated from service. Additionally, the Veteran has not contended that she had DMII while on active duty or asserted any theory to reflect why DMII should be service connected as a result of active duty. The Board finds the second element of service connection is not satisfied.  As the second element has not been met, there is no need to consider the nexus element of service connection. 

The Board is aware that the VA did not conduct a DMII examination. The VA is not obligated to provide an examination for a medical nexus opinion where there is no supporting nexus evidence in the record. 38 U.S.C. § 38 C.F.R. § 5103A(d)(2)A and B; McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512, 519 (2004). The claimant's own conclusory lay assertion alone is not sufficient to render a VA examination or opinion necessary and does not trigger VA's duty to obtain a medical opinion to decide the claims.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 

As the elements of service connection have not been satisfied for DMII, the persuasive weight of the evidence weighs against a finding of service connection for DMII. 

As the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, it is not in approximate balance; therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 CFR § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

6. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied. 

The February 2024 rating decision conceded the first element of service connection, a current disability of hypertension. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. Thus, the Board finds the first element of service connection is satisfied.

The second element of service connection is an in-service event resulting in the current disability or an inservice illness or disease. As noted above, the record reflected the Veteran did not participate in a TERA. 

The August 2022 VA hypotension examination report noted there was no evidence that the Veteran had hypertension while on active duty. The Veteran's blood pressure was taken many times while she was on active duty.  None of the in- service blood pressure readings reflected the Veteran had high blood pressure. For example. the Veteran's blood pressure in April 1976, was 80/30; May 1976, 120/70; November 1976, 116/76; January 1977, 110/60; August 1977, 100/70; September 1977, 112/82; June 1978, 110/68; December 1978, 110/72; February 1979, 90/60; March 1979, 100/70, and 100/54; April 1979, 110/84, and 104/68; May 1979, 108/68; and June 1979, 116/78. 

The August 2022 VA nexus examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not that incurred in or caused by the service. There was no evidence in the record to suggest the Veteran incurred hypertension while on active duty, nor has the Veteran contended that she had hypertension while on active duty. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that the Veteran was injured on active duty by a TERA which later resulted in hypertension. Therefore, the record does not reflect there was an inservice injury resulting in DMII.

As the elements of service connection have not been satisfied for hypertension, the persuasive weight of the evidence weighs against a finding of service connection for hypertension. 

As the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's hypertension claim, it is not in approximate balance; therefore, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 CFR § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
