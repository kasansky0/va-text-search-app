ORDER

An effective date of December 29, 2019, and no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder (now rated with general anxiety disorder to include insomnia) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran submitted a fully developed claim for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder on December 29, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of December 29, 2019, and no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder (now rated with general anxiety disorder to include insomnia) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active-duty military service from August 1977 to August 1981 and from December 1988 to September 1990. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

A letter was sent by the Board to the current representative of record in February 2025 notifying the representative that the appeal is before the Board.

An effective date of December 29, 2019, and no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder (now rated with general anxiety disorder to include insomnia) is granted.

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder. See February 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran specified, "I was discharged Sept 1990 under mental health condition". Id.

In cases involving service connection, the effective date will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i); Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 1999).

Here, the Veteran first sought entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include somatic symptom disorder, on December 29, 2019. The Veteran had not previously sought entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder. As a reminder, the Veteran separated from active-duty military service in 1990. 

The RO denied entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder in March 2020. A September 2020 higher-level review (HLR) continued the denial. The Veteran petitioned the Board in December 2020, and the Board granted entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder in November 2023. The RO effectuated the Board's decision in December 2023. The December 2023 rating decision is the decision that is currently on appeal. 

The Board notes that prior to the effectuation of the November 2023 Board grant, entitlement to service connection of a separate and distinct psychiatric disability was already awarded and the December 2023 effectuation/rating decision merely added the Veteran's somatic symptom disorder to the existing service-connected psychiatric disorder. 

Here, the Board discerns earlier entitlement to service-connection for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder because the claim for somatic symptom disorder was received on December 29, 2019, prior to all other claims for entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder. Accordingly, an effective date of December 29, 2019, and no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder (now rated with general anxiety disorder to include insomnia) is granted.   

The Board does not discern an effective date earlier than December 29, 2019, based on the Veteran's contention that "I was discharged Sept 1990 under mental health condition". The Veteran submitted a claim for benefits in September 1990. That claim form did not include any claim that expressly raised or reasonably raised a psychiatric disorder. As noted above, the first time that the Veteran requested entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder was on December 29, 2019, when he requested entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder. That claim was received by VA greater than one year after discharge from military service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i)

Based on the foregoing, an effective date of December 29, 2019, and no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for somatic symptom disorder (now rated with general anxiety disorder to include insomnia) is granted. In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the evidence is not in approximate balance, the doctrine is not for application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (2021).
