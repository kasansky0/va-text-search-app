REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1971 to December 1971.  He had additional service in the Army National Guard from April 7, 1971, to April 6, 1992. 

A rating decision was issued in July 2023 and constitutes an initial decision. In December 2023 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability that was most recently addressed in a July 2023 rating decision.  In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the Veteran's representative submitted a lay statement from D.S. with the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  (5/23/2024, Lay Statement, p. 1).  Generally, where a Veteran, or the Veteran's representative, submits evidence with a VA Form 10182 where the Direct Review docket was selected, it is the Board's policy to send the Veteran notice that the evidence submitted with the Notice of Disagreement cannot be considered on the Direct Review docket.  However, in this case the May 2024 lay statement is a duplicate of a lay statement received in December 2023.  (12/4/2023, Affidavit, p. 1).  As the Board can consider the December 2023 lay statement (which is the same as the letter submitted with the Notice of Disagreement) the Board finds that a notification letter is not necessary. 

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the April 2024 rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ obtained VA knee examinations and medical opinions in June 2023 and December 2023.  However, these medical opinions do not provide adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's right knee disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

Regarding the June 2023 medical opinion, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's right knee disability is less likely than not related to his period of active duty service as "there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of [degenerative joint disease of the] right knee and military service."  The examiner went on to conclude that "a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology."  (6/29/2023, C&P Exam, p. 2).

The Board finds that the June 2023 medical opinion is inadequate.  In this regard, the examiner did not address the Veteran's competent and credible lay assertion that he injured his right knee during service and has continued to have "flare-ups" of symptoms since his in-service injury.  (06/16/2023, C&P Exam, p. 3).  While the record does not contain medical evidence substantiating his lay assertion, nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions require both medical and competent lay evidence.  Indeed, competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself to substantiate a disability claim.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Here, the examiner did not address the Veteran's lay assertion that he has continued to experience symptoms since his in-service injury, and as such, the opinion is inadequate.

The Board additionally notes that the June 2023 examiner concluded that a post-service event is the more likely etiology of the Veteran's right knee disability.  However, this appears to be a baseless factual finding, as the examiner did not, or could not, cite to any post-service event that could cause his currently diagnosed right knee disability.  As the June 2023 medical opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise, the Board finds that the opinion is inadequate.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value.).

Regarding the December 2023 medical opinion, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current right knee disability is less likely than not related to his period of active duty service.  In so finding, the December 2023 examiner indicated that the Veteran's in-service injury is "poorly documented and may represent acute injury."  The examiner further indicated that the Veteran's in-service injury did not "in itself [imply] . . . probable chronicity."  (12/22/2023, C&P Exam, p. 4). 

The Board finds that the December 2023 medical opinion is inadequate.  First, the examiner's conclusion that the Veteran's in-service injury "may" have been an acute injury is speculative in nature.  See Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298 (2009) (holding that the equivocal nature of an examiner's opinion "should have signaled to the Board that the medical opinion was speculative and of little probative value").  The examiner's use of "may" implies that the Veteran's in-service injury "may or may not" have been acute in nature and is therefore too speculative to be of probative value.  See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993) (medical opinions expressed in terms of "may" also implies "may or may not" and is too speculative to establish medical nexus); See also Warren v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 4, 6 (1993) (stating that a physician's statement framed in terms such as "may" or "could" is not probative).  

Second, the examiner provided a negative medical opinion, in part, because the Veteran's in-service injury did not imply "probable" chronicity.  "Probable" as used by the examiner in the December 2023 medical opinion is a higher standard of proof than the general standard of proof in veterans' benefits cases.  The general standard of proof in veterans' benefits cases is the benefit of the doubt rule, which provides that when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the veteran.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  In applying the benefit of the doubt rule, VA should find for the veteran when there exists an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. This low standard of proof is "unique" to the VA adjudicatory process, and "the nation, 'in recognition of our debt to our veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding such benefits."  Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014) (citing Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54 (1990).  Here, "probable" as used by the examiner in the December 2023 medical opinion is a higher standard of proof than the benefit of the doubt rule.  As such, the Board finds that the examiner applied an impermissible standard of proof in proffering the December 2023 medical opinion and, therefore, the opinion is inadequate.  

Finally, the Board finds that the examinations of record do not address the relationship between the Veteran's in-service diagnosis of gout of the feet and his current diagnosis of gout.  (5/18/2023, Medical Treatment Record, p. 2-3, 6); (7/24/2023, CAPRI, p. 8).  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's in-service complaints of gout were related to his feet and his current claim is related to his right knee.  However, it is unclear what relationship, if any, the Veteran's in-service diagnosis of gout of the feet has with his current right knee symptoms.  As such, on remand the Board will request a medical opinion addressing the relationship between gout and the Veteran's current diagnosis.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his claimed right knee disability.  The examiner must review the claims file and provide a response to the following:

Does the Veteran at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or equal) have a current right knee disability, to include gout of the right knee? 

If so, is a right knee disability, to include gout of the right knee, at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or equal) related to his in-service diagnosis of gout of the feet?  

Is the Veteran's claimed right knee disability at least as likely as not (likelihood at least approximately balanced or equal) related to service, including in-service complaints of right knee pain or his in-service diagnosis of gout? 

In providing the requested opinion, the examiner must acknowledge and address the competent and credible lay evidence of record, to include the Veteran's lay assertion that he has experienced knee pain since his in-service injury, a lay statement from D.S. detailing the circumstances of the Veteran's in-service injury, and D.S.'s assertion that following the injury the Veteran would occasionally comment that his knee has been bothering him since the in-service injury.  (6/16/2023, C&P Exam, p. 3); (12/4/2023, Affidavit, p. 1-2).
