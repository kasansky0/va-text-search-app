ORDER

New and relevant evidence having not been received, the application to readjudicate the matter of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence received following the March 2024 rating decision that denied service connection for tinnitus is not new and relevant. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to readjudicate the claim for service connection for tinnitus are not met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from August 1991 to December 1994.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). Here, the March 2024 decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), denied the Veteran's claim to entitlement to service connection for tinnitus because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant. The March 2024 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies. The Veteran appealed the March 2024 rating decision by submitting a September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As a result, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that on in May 2024, the Veteran sought Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the tinnitus decision by submitting a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR. In a September 2024 HLR rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim to entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. However, the Veteran did not appeal the HLR rating decision and it is not before the Board. 

New and relevant evidence having not been received, the application to readjudicate the matter of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

Generally, a claim that has been denied in an unappealed Board or RO rating decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1100, 20.1103. The exception to this rule is 38 U.S.C. § 5108, which provides that, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, the Secretary shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim. VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidenced is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). 

The unappealed decision considered in this appeal is the March 2023 RO Rating Decision which denied the Veteran's claim for service connection of tinnitus. The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim to reopen and review that denied claim in March 2024. That same month, the RO once again denied the claim stating that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted since the date of the original decision (March 2023). The initial question before the Board is whether new and relevant evidence was submitted after the March 2023 decision and before the March 2024 decision on appeal.

At the time of the March 2024 decision, the evidence of record consisted of the Veteran's service treatment records, medical treatment records, lay statements, and VA examination opinions. Specifically, the March 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by service, but rather was a symptom of his hearing loss, which also was unrelated to service. Upon consideration of the evidence, the AOJ denied service connection.

Here, new and relevant evidence has not been submitted sufficient to reopen the claims for tinnitus. Since the original March 2023 rating decision, the only new evidence added to the claims file consists of the Veteran's contemporaneous medical treatment records and VA examinations related to his other claimed disabilities. Upon review of these records, the Board finds these records are wholly unrelated to the Veteran's claim of tinnitus. None of the additional treatment records and VA examinations indicate a relationship between the Veteran's service and his current disability. The Board finds that the evidence does not tend to prove or disprove the claim and is therefore, not relevant. 

The Board notes the Veteran has submitted statements in support of his claim in March 2024 (tinnitus) and June 2023 (hearing loss). In these statements the Veteran argues the merits of the RO's decision(s) but does not submit new evidence. Instead, he argues the weight and credibility of the evidence previously before the RO. New argument on old record is not new and relevant evidence. See Robertson v. Shinseki, 26 Vet.App. 169, 181 (2013). In short, new evidence was not submitted prior to the rating decision on appeal and, on that basis the appeal must be denied.

Provided the Veteran wishes to continue to seek recovery on this claim, a Supplemental Claim can be filed, then further documentation can be forwarded to the RO. The claim would be subsequently readjudicated upon consideration of the evidence.
