ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran experienced continuity of right ear hearing loss symptoms since his exposure to the conceded noise exposure during active service.

2. The Veteran does not have left ear hearing loss for VA purposes at any point during the period on appeal. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right ear hearing loss are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for left ear hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from August 1999 to June 2008.  The Veteran also had lengthy periods of National Guard and Reserve service, to include Air Force National Guard service from June 2008 to September 2009, Army Reserve service from July 2011 to July 2017, and Air Force Reserve service from January 2019 to May 2023.  

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

 

Service Connection

To establish direct service connection, there must be competent evidence showing: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the in-service injury incurred or aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Only chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) are entitled to the presumptive service connection provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  When a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Of note, diseases of the nervous system, such as hearing loss, are considered chronic diseases under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) and, thus, may be established by a showing continuity of symptomatology under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b). Walker, 708 F.3d at 1335-36. 

Hearing loss disability is defined by regulation.  For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Furthermore, clinical hearing loss is shown where the auditory thresholds exceed 20 decibels. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).  In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a) requires that VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009).

The absence of in-service evidence of hearing loss is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as noted above) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss. 

Generally, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  All information, lay evidence, and medical evidence in a case is to be considered by the Board in deciding the claim.  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, the claimant is to be given the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must preponderate against the claim. Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996), citing Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 54.

Lay evidence, if competent and credible, may serve to establish a nexus in certain circumstances. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009) (noting that lay evidence is not incompetent merely for lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  When considering whether lay evidence may be competent, the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is granted. 

The Veteran contends he has bilateral hearing loss and it is related to his active duty service.  He alleged he was told in-service he was losing his hearing in one ear.  

The Veteran's service treatment records (STR) document many audiograms throughout service.  In April 2002, September 2004, and January 2006, his STRs reflect he had a normal audiogram with no significant threshold shifts.  At separation, the Veteran reported hearing loss and attributed it to his noise exposure in-service.  His STRs document his hearing was within normal limits at separation.  His separation examination in March 2008 noted the Veteran's hearing loss was subjective at that time but he would be sent to audiologist and his STRs noted his primary diagnosis was hearing loss.  He was sent in March 2008 for an audiological evaluation and the Veteran reported possible hearing loss.  The March 2008 evaluation from Highland Clinic noted the pure tone air and bone conduction testing revealed hearing within normal limits bilaterally and speech reception thresholds corroborated the pure tone findings and discrimination for speech was excellent in both ears.  The evaluation found the Veteran's hearing was in the normal range for both ears.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his hearing loss in May 2023 and he was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear for VA purposes.   38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The right ear word recognition score was 100%.

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	%

The May 2023 VA examiner reported there was no permanent positive threshold shift greater than a normal measurement variability at any frequency between 500 and 6000 for the right ear.  The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was not at least as likely as not approximately balanced or nearly equally caused by or the result of an event in service.  The VA examiner stated the Veteran's hearing testing from April 2009 was normal and there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation, which is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise.  The VA examiner further stated there is no valid current evidence that noise exposure can cause late-onset hearing loss. 

The Board finds the May 2023 VA medical opinion for the right ear is inadequate for adjudication purposes.  After the May 2023 VA examination was performed, but prior to the date of the Rating Decision on appeal, additional Reserve STRs were added to the claims file.  In this regard, the examiner was unable to address the relevant medical records and did not contemplate the Veteran's competent and credible statements regarding the in-service onset and continuity of his symptoms. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's periods of  Reserve and Air National Guard service, including INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA that have not been verified.  While these records are not being utilized to affirm an in-service event, the Reserve STRs do provide additional evidence into the progression of the Veteran's right ear hearing loss.  As such, while the VA examiner was unable to review these records, the Board conducts a de novo review and as such, is granting entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss.  

The Veteran's Reserve STRs document he underwent additional audiograms which reflect worsening of his right ear at 4000Hz, which is consistent with the worsening of his right hear hearing loss as evidenced by his May 2023 VA examination.

The evidence of record reflects the Veteran has right ear hearing loss and his in-service noise exposure was conceded by the May 2023 VA examiner.  Additionally, the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) was munitions maintenance.  The June 2023 rating decision issued a favorable finding stating the Veteran's MOS had a moderate probability for hearing loss. 

The Board finds the Veteran is competent to identify reduced hearing acuity and report on the chronicity of symptomatology since active service.  Moreover, his statements have been found credible, as he was continuously reporting hearing loss during his active service as found in his STRs. 

In sum, the Board has conceded acoustic trauma during service.  The Veteran has competently and credibly reported that he first experienced hearing loss while in active service and that those symptoms have continued since that time. While there is a VA medical opinion of record against the claim, that opinion is not adequate.  Additionally, the medical evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's hearing loss has consistently worsened over time, as he has repeatedly reported.  Furthermore, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.

As the Board finds that the Veteran is competent and credible with respect to the onset and continuing symptoms of his right ear hearing loss, the Board has assigned his statements high probative value.  Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  Lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, can ultimately be considered competent, regardless of a lack of contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The Board further notes that hearing loss is considered a chronic disease, and therefore service connection may be granted under a theory of chronicity and continuity of symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Therefore, considering the evidence of record in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's right ear hearing loss was incurred in-service and that there has been continuity of symptomatology of right ear hearing loss since his active service.  Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is warranted.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends his hearing loss is related to his active service.  Unfortunately, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss must be denied.  The evidence of record reflects the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of left ear hearing loss in accordance with VA regulations.  

The Veteran's STR consistently document the Veteran reported hearing loss in-service but his audiograms during active service returned that his left ear was within normal limits.  There was no evidence of any significant threshold shifts in his STR.  At separation, his hearing test was normal.  

The Board notes additional Reserve STR were added to the claims file after the May 2023 VA examination but prior to the Rating Decision on appeal was issued.  However, an additional remand is not required, as the hearing conservation data provided audiograms that compared to the Veteran's reference audiogram in 2000.  There are minimal shifts in his left ear hearing but they do not amount to significant thresholds shifts.  Additionally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's had extensive Reserve and Air National Guard service and INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA have not been verified and the records have not been provided.  However, this would not change the outcome of the Board's decision, as a requirement to entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is the Veteran must have a current disability, which in this case would be left ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  The determination of whether hearing loss is present for VA purposes is dependent on objective testing showing that the VA standards have been met, and those results (May 2023 VA examination) do not show hearing loss to be considered a disability pursuant to applicable VA regulations.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his hearing loss in May 2023.  The left ear word recognition score was 100%.  

	HERTZ	CNC

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	%

RIGHT	5	5	10	15	15	11

Hearing loss for VA purposes was not shown at this examination.  Specifically, the VA examiner documented the Veteran had normal left ear hearing. The Veteran did not have a hearing loss of 40 decibels at any frequency in the left ear, he did not have three frequencies at 26 decibels or greater in the left ear, and his speech recognition score was at 100 percent for the left ear.  The VA examiner reported there was no permanent positive threshold shift greater than normal measurement variability at any frequency in the left ear and concluded the Veteran has normal left ear hearing.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contentions regarding his in-service noise exposure. The VA conceded the fact he had an MOS that was moderately probable for hearing loss.  Although that exposure is sufficient to find evidence of an in-service incurrence, the most probative, competent, and credible evidence of record fails to show that the Veteran currently suffers from left ear hearing loss for VA purposes.

None of this is to say that a future claim for service connection would not be successful; instead, in applying the laws and regulations governing VA benefits, the Board simply finds at this point that the Veteran's left ear hearing has not deteriorated to a point to be considered a disability for VA purposes.

As such, the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss; the evidence is not in approximate balance, and the benefit of the doubt rule is inapplicable.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for back disability, to include as secondary to right knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability, a right knee disability, and a back disability, to include as secondary to right knee.  The Veteran's STRs document in-service ankle pain and reference to a possible ankle sprain, numerous entries for right knee pain and iliotibial band (IT band) friction syndrome. 

The Veteran underwent VA examinations in May 2023 for the ankle, back, and knee claims.  The May 2023 VA ankle examination concluded there was no current ankle diagnosis and stated there was only subjective information only, the objective examination was normal and no diagnosis was rendered.  The VA examiner did not provide a direct opinion but did provide a secondary opinion, stating there is no clear evidence after review of orthopedic literature to suggest an injury to one joint would impact another.  This opinion is inadequate because it failed to consider whether the Veteran's complaints of pain result in functional impairment.

The May 2023 VA knee examination reported the Veteran was diagnosed with right knee osteoarthritis and concluded it was less likely than not due to his active service.  The VA examiner stated there was "scant data" to support a nexus between the current diagnosis and his active service, noting that without chronicity during or after service, a post-service event is more likely the etiology.  This opinion is inadequate because the examiner appears to have dismissed the Veteran's contentions regarding continuity of right knee symptoms solely because they are not documented in contemporaneous treatment records.

The record reflects the Veteran has a significant period of Reserve and National Guard service.  Some of these records are associated with the claims file, however, it is clear all of his records from his Reserve and National Guard service have not been associated with the claims file.  Additionally, periods of active duty service, including INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA have not been verified.  Thus, the Board seeks all outstanding Reserve and National Guard treatment records.  Accordingly, under the duty to assist, VA must attempt to obtain additional service treatment records, and to verify the Veteran's periods of active duty service as well as status (ACDUTRA versus INACDUTRA). See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A ; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

Failure to secure a complete record upon which to decide this claim constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error by the AOJ.  To ensure VA has fulfilled its duty to assist, a remand to obtain the service treatment records and personnel records for all periods of service is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

As such, entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability, right knee disability, and for a back disability is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Verify the Veteran's periods of service including ACDUTRA and/or INACDUTRA.  All attempts made should be documented in the claims file.

2. Obtain and associate with the claims file the outstanding service treatment records during the Veteran's periods of service including his Reserve service, Air National Guard service, and any periods of ACDUTRA/INACDUTRA service.

All attempts made should be documented in the claims file.

3. After conducting the development above, provide the entire claims file and this remand to an appropriate examiner for review.  The necessity of an in-person examination is left to the examiner's discretion. The examiner is directed to render an addendum opinion, including rationale, addressing the following:

Whether it is at least as likely as not the Veteran's right knee disability (i) began during active service, (ii) manifested within one year after discharge from service, or (iii) was noted during service with continuity of the same symptomatology since service.

Opine whether the Veteran's right knee disability is least as likely as not related his active service?

4. After the above development, return the entire claims file and this remand to an appropriate examiner for review.  The necessity of an in-person examination is left to the examiner's discretion. The examiner is directed to render a medical opinion, including rationale, addressing the following:

a)	Whether the Veteran has a current disability with regard to the claimed back disability and right ankle disability.  Please note that pain can constitute a current disability even without an underlying diagnosis if the pain results in functional impairment.

b)	If a current disability (to include pain that results in functional impairment) is diagnosed, opine whether the Veteran's back disability and/or right ankle disability are at least as likely as not related to his active service, to include the reported in-service ankle sprain?

(Continued on the next page)

?

c)	If service connection for the right knee is established, the examiner must also address whether any current back disability is either caused or aggravated by the right knee disability, to include as due to an altered gait.  

The opinions should be accompanied by a clear rationale consistent with the evidence of record including discussion of the facts of this case, supporting clinical data, and any medical studies or references relied upon. If the clinician is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, they must provide a reasoned explanation for such conclusion.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
