REASONS FOR REMAND

The appellant served on active duty from December 1979 to January 1981, he was discharged under other than honorable conditions.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 higher-level review issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. 

In February 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection, for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, for VA compensation benefits purposes, is remanded.

The Veteran essentially seeks "veteran" status.  His contends that the character of his discharge from service should not be a bar to the receipt of compensation benefits. 

In this regard, the appellant's service record reveals he entered service on December 7, 1979, for three-year enlistment, at the age of 17 and having completed one year of high school.  On July 9, 1980, the appellant went AWOL.  He was apprehended on October 21, 1980, and charges were preferred against the appellant.  Although the appellant's request for discharge is unavailable, records show that under the jurisdiction of a general court martial, after consulting with counsel, the appellant knowingly, willing, and voluntarily declared he was AWOL.  He acknowledged that in requesting a discharge he could receive an other than honorable discharge.  The appellant submitted a statement that he was 19 years old with one year of high school education.  He was requesting a discharge because his grandmother and brother were in bad health, and he was needed at home.  On January 21, 1981, the appellant was discharged under other than honorable conditions. 

In July 2013 and September 2019, the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (ABCMR) declined to issue an upgrade.  In his application, the appellant explained that he was young and had made a mistake. 

Following a review of the record the Board finds that a remand is warranted in this case.  Here, the appellant stated in his AOJ hearing that he has an application pending for a discharge upgrade with the ABCMR.  See December 2023 DRO Hearing.  As any such documents are directly relevant to the issue on appeal, see 38 C.F.R. § 3.12, a remand is necessary to obtain these records, as there is another statutory or regulatory duty that has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.

The Board also notes that on remand, the AOJ should issue a new administrative decision regarding the appellant's claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(1).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Make appropriate requests to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (ABCMR), and any other appropriate repository for any records related to the appellant, to specifically include any requests or evidence and argument submitted by the appellant, as well as any decisional documents.  Associate any documents with the claims file.  Any negative search should be noted in the record and communicated to the appellant.

2. Issue an administrative decision regarding the issue of character of discharge.
