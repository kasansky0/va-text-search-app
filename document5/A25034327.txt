ORDER

An effective date earlier than June 9, 2022, for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for unspecified depressive disorder, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The first claim for an increased rating for service-connected unspecified depressive disorder after the final April 2021 rating decision was received on June 9, 2022.

2. On June 9, 2022, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File, followed by a June 2023 Supplemental Claim, requesting an increased rating for chronic depression.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The April 2021 rating decision is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 9, 2022, for the assignment of the 100 percent disability rating for unspecified depressive disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1984 to March 1988.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that decision, the RO granted an increased rating of 100 percent, effective June 9, 2022, for unspecified depressive disorder. 

By way of background, in a June 14, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and appealed the issue of "the effective date of 100% VA rating," referencing the August 2023 rating decision.  The Board sent the Veteran a clarification letter in July 2024, advising that his request did not identify which issues he wanted to appeal.  The letter explained that the Veteran must submit a new VA Form 10182 that lists the dates of the decisions with the specific issues the Veteran wished to appeal within 60 days of the date of the clarification letter or one year from the date on his decision letter (emphasis added). 

The Veteran submitted an August 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD, which listed the issue of "effective date of decision letter dated August 30, 2023."  The Board sent another clarification letter in August 2024.  In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 NOD, listing the issue as "the effective date of unspecified depressive disorder."  The Board accepted the Veteran's September 2024 VA Form 10182 as a timely response to the clarification letter, and in September 2024, the Board advised the Veteran that his August 2024 VA Form 10182 was placed on the Direct Review docket.

The Direct Review docket does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, as this is a Direct Review appeal, the record closed as of the August 2023 rating decision.

Evidence added during an ineligible period will not be considered.  Should the Veteran want VA to consider evidence submitted outside the eligible period, the Veteran should submit a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, identifying such evidence.

Effective Date

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim; a claim reopened after final disallowance; or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

According to the law in effect prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.151.  A "claim" was defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by the VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  If received within 1 year from the date it was sent to the claimant, the formal claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications that may be construed as an application or claim.  Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

Regulations defining a "claim" were revised, effective March 24, 2015.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The revision eliminated informal claims and required claims on specific forms.

Generally, under the legacy appeals system, an application that had been previously denied cannot preserve an effective date for a later grant of benefits based on a new application.  See Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343, 346-47 (1997); see also Washington v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 391, 393 (1997) ("The fact that the appellant had previously submitted claim applications, which had been denied, is not relevant to the assignment of an effective date based on a current application.")  "The statutory framework simply does not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim."  Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002).  Thus, the effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA.  Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).

Once a rating decision is final, only a request for a revision premised on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) can result in the assignment of an earlier effective date.  See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006); see also Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("absent a showing of clear and unmistakable error, [the Veteran] cannot receive disability payments for a time frame earlier than the application date of his claim to reopen, even with new evidence supporting an earlier disability date."); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332, 340 (1995) ("when a claim to reopen is successful and the benefit sought is awarded upon readjudication, the effective date is the date of the claim to reopen"); Bingham v. Nicholson, 421 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2005).

Where a claim is subject to the modernized review system under the AMA based on date of initial claim or by election of the veteran, provisions exist that permit an effective date based on date of claim to be "preserved" following issuance of a decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500.  Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h) provides that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession a supplemental claim, request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).

The applicable effective date statute and regulations provide that the proper effective date for increased rating claims is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim for increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3) formerly § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § § 3.400 (o)(2).

If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of the claim for increase.  Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.  The Federal Circuit has reaffirmed that "the plain language of [section] 5110(b)(2) only permits an earlier effective date for increased disability compensation if that disability increased during the one-year period before the filing of the claim."  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (explaining the legislative history of 38 U.S.C. § § 5110(b)(2) was to provide veterans with a one-year grace period for filing a claim following an increase in a service-connected disability).

To summarize, there are three possible effective dates for an increased rating depending on the facts of the case.  If an increase in disability occurred after the claim was filed, the effective date will be the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose).  If an increase in disability preceded the claim by a year or less, the effective date will be the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable).  If an increase in disability preceded the claim by more than a year, the effective date will be the date that the claim is received (date of claim).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 9, 2022, for the 100 percent increased evaluation of unspecified depressive disorder

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than June 9, 2022, for the award of a 100 percent evaluation for service-connected unspecified depressive disorder.  He asserts that the effective date should be either the remand date of June 1, 2018, or the Intent to File on February 19, 2019.  See September 16, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement; see also June 14, 2024, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Veteran originally filed his claim for depression and anxiety on December 16, 2010.  See December 16, 2010, VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation. In a July 2011 rating decision, the RO denied service connection for depression and anxiety.  See July 7, 2011, Rating Decision - Narrative.  The Veteran appealed the July 2011 rating decision with a December 2011 notice of disagreement.  See December 27, 2011, NOD.  In June 2014, the RO issued a statement of the case (SOC).  See June 20, 2014, SOC.  The Veteran timely filed a substantive appeal (VA Form 9) to the Board in August 2014; the appeal was certified to the Board in May 2015.  The RO issued a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) in May 2015, and the appeal was again certified to the Board in June 2015.  In June 2018, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include major depressive disorder. 

On February 18, 2019, the Veteran filed a VA 21-0996 Intent to File.

On September 25, 2019, the RO issued an SSOC regarding the issue of service connection for depression and anxiety.  In December 2019, the Board remanded the claim of entitlement to service connection for a variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder.  The RO issued an SSOC in April 2020, and the appeal was certified to the Board in May 2020. 

In August 2020, the Board remanded the issue of entitlement to service connection for a variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder.  In an April 2021 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with an evaluation of 10 percent effective December 16, 2010, and 30 percent evaluation effective December 1, 2010.  See April 1, 2021, Rating Decision - Narrative.  The Veteran received notification of this decision on April 8, 2021.

The Veteran filed an Intent to File, received on June 9, 2022.  See June 10, 2022, Notification Letter.

On June 12, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, the Veteran requested an increased rating for chronic depression, asserting that his symptoms more closely resemble that of a 70 percent rating.  In the August 2023 rating decision, the RO increased the evaluation of unspecified depressive disorder to 100 percent effective June 9, 2022. 

While the Veteran first filed his claim for depression and anxiety on December 16, 2010, he did not timely appeal the April 2021 rating decision within a year of notification, and it became final.  New and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) was not received within a year of the April 2021 rating decision, and the Veteran did not provide any argument or express any disagreement with the April 2021 rating decision prior to submitting the June 9, 2022, Intent to File.  As such, the unappealed April 2021 decision became final. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that the proper effective date for the 100 percent evaluation of unspecified depressive disorder is either the date of the Board remand (June 1, 2018) or the date of the Intent to File (February 19, 2019 (Intent to File).  However, as noted above, there are three possible effective dates for an increased rating: the date entitlement arose, the date the increase became factually ascertainable, or the date of claim.  The date of a Board remand is not an available effective date.  Notably, the claim on appeal before the Board at the time of the June 1, 2018, Board remand stemmed from the original claim, filed on December 16, 2010, which was ultimately granted in the April 2021 rating decision.  

Regarding the February 19, 2019, Intent to File, the Veteran's claim was already pending before the Board, therefore, the 2019 Intent to File was not necessary and cannot serve as the effective date for this claim.  Additionally, relevant evidence indicating that an increased rating was warranted in the year prior to the June 2022 Intent to File is not of record, and thus, it was not factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred in the year preceding the June 2022 Intent to File.

The June 9, 2022, Intent to File is the earliest date of claim after the final April 2021 decision.  Nothing in the record demonstrates any intent by the Veteran to file a claim for increase of this claim until over a year after the rating decision.  Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran was not lacking for knowledge of the process.  The Veteran filled out and submitted a fully developed claim regarding left knee and lower back conditions in June 2021.  Therefore, as the Veteran's claim for an increased rating was received on June 9, 2022, the claim for an effective date earlier than June 9, 2022, for the 100 percent evaluation of service-connected unspecified depressive disorder must be denied.  There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved regarding this issue.
