ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 4, 2018 for the increased rating of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A May 2018 statement of the case (SOC) and corresponding rating decision denied entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 30 percent for PTSD prior to May 4, 2018 and 70 percent thereafter.  The Veteran did not substantively appeal the May 2018 SOC or submit new and material evidence within a year of the May 2018 rating decision; thus, the May 2018 SOC and rating decision became final and the Veteran does not allege clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in this rating decision.

2. A July 2021 rating decision continued the Veteran's 70 percent disability rating for PTSD from May 4, 2018.  The Veteran did not appeal, request higher level review, or provide a supplemental claim within a year of the rating decision; thus, the July 2021 rating decision became final, and the Veteran also does not allege CUE in this rating decision.

3. The Veteran filed an intent to file (ITF), received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on November 1, 2022 and a subsequent claim was received for an increased rating for PTSD on June 1, 2023; however, the Veteran's PTSD disability rating of 70 percent was not increased in the November 2023 rating decision currently under appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than May 4, 2018 for the increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.102, 3.159, 3.156, 3.400, 19.52.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2006 to November 2012.  He appeals a November 2023 rating decision by the VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denying "entitlement to an earlier effective date for service-connected PTSD rating of 70 percent."  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran requested the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  Id.

Under direct review, the Board considers the same record as that before the AOJ at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the November 2023 rating decision.  Id.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

On the August 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed "an earlier effective date for service-connected PTSD rating of 70 percent."

As a preliminary note, the Veteran's representative electronically filed the August 2024 VA Form 10182 and included a cover letter that generically stated, "the Veteran desires to appeal all of the issues listed in the [November 2023 rating decision] and all issues which are raised by the record including errors in failing to adjudicate issues or claims reasonably raised by the record, even though not specifically mentioned by the Veteran."

Despite this addendum by the Veteran's representative, the Board finds that the only issue on appeal is the one specifically noted on the August 2024 VA Form 10182.  A notice of disagreement (NOD) must be properly completed on the prescribed form, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  If a rating decision addresses several issues, the NOD must identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  Id.  The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.  Id.  Only a VA Form 10182 can be used to appeal a claim to the Board, and requests to modify an NOD must be made by completing a new VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d), (c)(2).  Taken together, this regulation seems to prohibit the Board from accepting a separate letter as an appeal for issues not listed on the NOD. Furthermore, while the form used for substantively appealing to the Board in the legacy appeals system (VA Form 9) allowed a claimant to check a box appealing "all of the issues" listed on the relevant SOC, AMA appeals require the appellant to "identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees,"  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  This requirement is repeatedly noted on the VA Form 10182.  Therefore, the Board finds that the only issue on appeal is the issue specifically written on the VA Form 10182, "entitlement to an earlier effective date for service-connected PTSD rating of 70 percent."  The Board will proceed with adjudication.

As history, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD that was received by VA on October 17, 2014.  Service connection for PTSD was granted and an initial 30 percent disability rating was assigned, effective October 17, 2014.  See September 2015 rating decision.  In October 2015, the Veteran timely filed a notice of disagreement with the initial rating and a May 2018 rating decision increased the Veterans rating to 70 percent, effective May 4, 2018.  A May 2018 Statement of the Case (SOC) denied entitlement to an initial rating greater than 30 percent prior to May 4, 2018 and 70 percent thereafter.  In July 2018, the Veteran contacted VA and noted he "agrees with the decision made on the [May 2018] SOC."  See July 2018 VA Form 21-0820.  Generally, a rating decision becomes final if the Veteran does not submit a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 19.52.  An SOC becomes final if the Veteran does not substantively appeal within 60 days from the date that the AOJ mails the SOC, or within the remainder of the one year period from the date of the rating decision, whichever is later.  Id.  Thus, as the Veteran did not substantively appeal the May 2018 SOC or submit new and material evidence within a year of the rating decision, the decision became final.

Later, in July 2021, the AOJ confirmed the Veteran's current 70 percent disability rating.  See July 2021 rating decision.  Again, the Veteran did not appeal or submit new and material evidence within a year of the July 2021 rating decision, and the July 2021 rating decision became final.  Importantly, the Veteran does not allege CUE in any previous final decision by the AOJ.

On November 1, 2022, more than one year after the July 2021 rating decision, VA received an intent to file (ITF).  See November 2022 VA Form 21-0966.  On June 1, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ claim for an increased rating for PTSD, which was developed and denied in a November 2023 rating decision.  In August 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182 appealing the November 2023 rating decision's denial of "entitlement to an earlier effective date for service-connected PTSD rating of 70 percent."  The Board will consider whether an effective date earlier than May 4, 2018 is warranted for the 70 percent rating for PTSD.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for an increased rating will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  The date of receipt shall be the date on which the claim was received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  However, the effective date may also be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application for increase in compensation is received within one year from such date.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  Thus, a veteran is only entitled to an earlier effective date for an award of disability compensation if an increase in his disability occurred during the year before he filed his claim.  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (2010).

Additionally, prior to filing a claim, a Veteran may indicate the "desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA."  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  After submission of an ITF, if VA receives a complete claim for benefits within 1 year of receipt of the ITF, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the ITF was received by VA.  Id.

Here, the record reflects the Veteran filed a valid ITF form which was received by VA on November 1, 2022, and then filed a subsequent June 2023 claim for an increased rating for PTSD.  However, after development of the Veteran's June 2023 claim, the AOJ continued the Veteran's 70 percent rating for PTSD.  See November 2023 rating decision.  Thus, the earliest appeal period for the Board's consideration is from November 1, 2021, one year prior to the date of the Veteran's ITF.  However, in this case, the Veteran's PTSD disability rating was rated at 70 percent as far back a May 4, 2018, well before the Veteran filed his November 2022 ITF.

By law, the Board cannot grant entitlement to a 70 percent disability rating prior to May 4, 2018, as the May 2018 SOC, corresponding May 2018 rating decision, and the July 2021 rating decision are all final.

As such, the Board finds the criteria for an effective date earlier than May 4, 2018 for the increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD are not met.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990).  The appeal is denied.
