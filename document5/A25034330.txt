DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of an increased rating for the left ankle and right ankle and special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the need for regular aid and attendance of another person is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1995 to August 1995. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision (SMC) and a September 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision (left and right ankles) from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran timely appealed, submitting a VA Form 10182 in September 2024 and selected the Direct Review docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Written withdrawal is effective upon receipt. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55(b).

In September 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the present appeal, the Veteran notified VA that he wished to withdraw this appeal in favor of another claim in the evidence lane which remains before the Board. See September 2024 VA Form 21-4138. As such, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration and the appeal is dismissed.
