FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In April 2025, the Board dismissed the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to service connection for ED. The dismissal was in error.

2. The Veteran's ED is but-for due to his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for vacatur of the April 2, 2025, Board decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

1. 2. The criteria service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1992 to July 1992 and from May 1993 to January 2000.

This matter was initially denied in a September 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In November 2023, the Veteran requested HLR of the September 2023 denial of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  The AOJ again denied the Veteran's claim in a December 2023 rating decision, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.

In June 2024 the Veteran again requested HLR of the September 2023 rating decision.  This request constitutes an improper claim.

Subsequently in June 2024, the Veteran timely submitted an NOD seeking appeal of the September 2023 rating decision.  The Veteran checked "direct review" by a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, any evidence submitted after the September 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher level review, cannot be considered by the Board.? 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.?

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In this case, a docket switch is still permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is less than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, but it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the June 2024 NOD.  However, as the instant decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought, there is no prejudice to the Veteran for proceeding before the end of one year from rating decision on appeal, and the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

1. Vacatur

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the appellant or his or her representative, or on the Board's own motion, when an appellant has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1000.

Here, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), in November 2023 and requested review of the September 2023 rating decision.  In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an HLR decision denying the Veteran's claim, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the initial rating decision.

Because the Veteran previously chose review of the September 2023 rating decision in the Higher-Level Review Lane, the only options available for the Veteran to appeal were to file either a Board Appeal or Supplemental Claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(2).

The Veteran's June 2024 request for HLR essentially requests a second HLR of a decision that has already been subject to HLR. This is an improper claim. Id.

Therefore, the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) is valid because 1) it was a timely appeal of the September 2023 rating decision and 2) there were no valid, concurrent appeals pending.

Accordingly, the April 2, 2025, Board decision is vacated in its entirety.

2. Entitlement to service connection for ED is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for erectile dysfunction as secondary to his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress.  See February 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of 1) a current disability; 2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and 3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163?(Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service, when all the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: 1) a current disability; 2) a primary, service-connected disability; and 3) a nexus between the current disability and the service-connected disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1988).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability resulting from a service-connected disease or injury.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability results from the service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that section 1110 "requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability"); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc). Compensation may also be established for "the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability."  See Spicer, 61 F.4th 1364.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Initially, the Board notes the AOJ conceded the Veteran has a current diagnosis of ED, participated in a toxic exposure risk activity in service in Southwest Asia, and is service connected for unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran does not contend, nor does the evidence of record support a finding, that his ED is directly related to service.  See August 2023 Medical Opinion (finding the Veteran's ED was not related to in service exposures).

Therefore, the only remaining question before the Board is whether the Veteran's ED is caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023, at which time the examiner confirmed a diagnosis for ED.  The March 2023 examiner did not provide an opinion for ED.  VA obtained a medical opinion for secondary service connection in July 2023 in which the examiner opined that ED is ultimately a blood flow issue and may be caused by hardening of the arteries, obesity, nerve damage, diseases of the nervous system, or hormonal problems.  The examiner determined that the Veteran's ED was less likely than not due to the unspecified depressive disorder.

A TERA opinion was also obtained in August 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's ED was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA activity as medical literature suggests any possible toxins would mimic negative effects of medication.  The examiner explained that many medications can cause or exacerbate ED, albeit temporarily.  The examiner further noted that available research indicates ED is primarily a vascular disease but has psychogenic causes as well.

The Board finds the July 2023 VA medical opinion inadequate because the examiner 1) failed to address the aggravation prong of causation for secondary service connection, 2) failed to address the Veteran's relevant medical records and lay statements, 3) proffered a conclusory opinion with no rationale, and 4) the opinion does not implement the "but-for" causation standard of 38 U.S.C. § 1110 as articulated in Spicer.  See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360.  Further, while the August 2023 opinion provides a negative nexus for direct service connection due to a TERA in service, the Board notes the information about vascular and psychogenic causes for ED tend to demonstrate the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety is a cause of his ED.

When the VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).  To be considered adequate, medical examination reports must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  Therefore, the Board finds the VA medical opinion proffered less persuasive and affords limited probative weight on the issue of nexus for secondary service connection.  Conversely, the Board finds the August 2023 medical opinion persuasive for secondary service connection.

Additionally, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion in support of his claim. See February 2023 Independent Medical Examination. The private examiner confirmed the Veteran's ED diagnosis.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress and associated medications affect his mood, libido, and intimacy without question.  Further, the examiner explained that such factors contribute to an increase in severity of the Veteran's ED consistent with his own clinical experience and relevant medical literature cited within the opinion.  Ultimately, the private examiner opined that it is "more likely than not" that the Veteran's disabling ED is aggravated by, and therefore, secondary to his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress.

The Board finds the private medical opinion adequate and substantially probative. The opinion provided reasons for conclusions based on accurate characterization of the evidence of record and relevant medical literature available.  Therefore, the private medical opinion is entitled to significant probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of the Veteran's contention that his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress is a but-for cause of his diagnosed ED.  As the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim for service connection of ED as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected unspecified depressive disorder with anxious distress, service connection is warranted.  The Veteran's claim is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
