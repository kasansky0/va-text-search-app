DOCKET NO. 240116-408053
DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 4, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for hypertension is granted.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for hypertension is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  In a December 2010 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied a claim for service connection for hypertension.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of its issuance.

2.  Following the December 2010 rating decision, the Veteran first filed an application to reopen the claim for service connection for hypertension on February 4, 2014, and the evidence shows that his hypertension is related to his presumed in-service herbicide agent exposure on a direct incurrence basis.

3.  The Veteran has required medication for control of his service-connected hypertension, but he has not been shown to have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.  

4.  During the appeal period, the Veteran's diastolic pressure has not been predominantly 100 or more, and his systolic pressure has not been predominantly 160 or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of February 4, 2014, for the grant of service connection for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.150, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable evaluation for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1967 to December 1969.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 and elected to have a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

A hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in December 2023.  A transcript of that proceeding has been associated with the claims file.

The Board notes that the Veteran has other separately docketed appeals, which will be addressed in other decisions.  

Law and Analysis

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues decided herein.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  The effective date for an award of service connection is the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date is the later of the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The effective date based on the submission of new and material evidence received after a final disallowance is the date of the receipt of the new claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (q)(2), 3.400(r).  It is settled law that the effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) ("the Court thus holds that the effective date statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monthly benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed").  In the Sears case, the Court explained that the statutory framework did not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim. The Court explained that the term, new claim, as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the former regulations prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for hypertension.

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for hypertension, which was denied in a May 1971 rating decision. The AOJ had found that his blood pressure was normal at the time of his separation from service and that there was no evidence of hypertension during service or within one year thereafter.  The Veteran was notified of that decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence within one year thereafter.  Therefore, the May 1971 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran later submitted a request to reopen the claim for service connection for hypertension in June 2010, which the AOJ denied in a December 2010 rating decision.  The Veteran was notified of that decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not appeal that decision or submit new and material evidence within one year thereafter.  Therefore, the December 2010 rating decision also became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.200, 20.201, 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran subsequently filed another claim for service connection for hypertension on February 4, 2014.  The AOJ denied that claim, and the Veteran perfected an appeal.  Thereafter, in a November 2022 decision, the Board granted service connection for hypertension.  In particular, the Board found that the Veteran had been exposed to herbicide agents while serving onboard the USS Saint Paul in Da Nang Harbor.  The Board also relied on a February 2022 VA examiner's opinion that his hypertension was at least as likely as not related to his in-service Agent Orange exposure.  

The AOJ implemented the Board decision in the January 2023 rating decision currently on appeal and assigned an effective date of August 10, 2022, based on the passage of the of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

The PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases presumptively associated with herbicide agent exposure.  However, the Board did not grant the claim under the PACT Act.  Rather, the Board had found that service connection was warranted on a direct facts-found basis relying on a VA examiner's medical opinion to establish a nexus to the Veteran's herbicide exposure. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007). 

Moreover, the evidence shows that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension as of February 4, 2014.  Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date of February 4, 2014, is warranted for the grant of service connection for hypertension.  

Nevertheless, the Board finds that an effective date prior to February 4, 2014, is not warranted because the Veteran did not file a claim until that date following the final December 2010 rating decision.  

Moreover, the Nehmer effective date rules set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 do not apply to the presumptions created by the PACT Act on August 10, 2022.  Indeed, the PACT Act states that compensation for service-connected hypertension due to presumptive herbicide agent exposure is not entitled to retroactive effective dates available to Nehmer class members. See, PACT Act, section 404(d)(1)(B) and (d)(2)(B); Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022).  In October 2022, the VA Secretary also issued an Executive Decision Memorandum (EDM) stating that the Nehmer effective date rules in 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 do not apply to the presumptions created on or after August 10, 2022, to include those created by the PACT Act (such as hypertension).

In addition, the Veteran did not file a claim for service connection for hypertension on or after January 1, 2020.  Thus, the criteria under 38 U.S.C. § 1116A for the exception to the general effective date rules do not apply in this case.  The Board also notes that the AOJ sent a letter to the Veteran in October 2019 advising him of the passage of the BWN Act and specifically advised him that he could submit a supplemental claim, VA Form 20-0995, to have his previously denied claim reviewed under the new law.  He was also informed that the claim would not be reviewed if he did not submit such a claim.  However, the Veteran and his representative did not respond to that letter or submit a supplemental claim

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of February 4, 2014, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for hypertension.

Increased Evaluation

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation for hypertension, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more; or, as the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.  A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more; or, systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  A 40 percent evaluation is contemplated for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more.  A 60 percent evaluation is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

For VA compensation purposes, the term hypertension means that diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 or greater with diastolic blood pressure less than 90.  Hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1).

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore, may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal.  Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board find that the Veteran is not entitled to an initial compensable evaluation for his service-connected hypertension.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been prescribed medication for control of his hypertension.  However, the evidence does not show that he has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.  Moreover, the evidence does not show that his diastolic pressure has been predominantly 100 or more or that his systolic pressure has been predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period.

The January 2022 examiner noted the reported history of hypertension since the mid to late 1970s, which was treated with amlodipine and Losartan.  It was noted that there was no history of diastolic blood pressure predominantly 100 or more.  Blood pressure readings at that time were also 142/82, 142/82, and 140/80, and the examiner found that there was no functional impact due to hypertension.  

VA treatment records also document good blood pressure control with regular exercise recommended.  See, e.g., VA treatment records dated January 2014 (blood pressure 141/90); September 2014 (blood pressure 121/74); August 2015 (blood pressure 125/76); December 2015 (blood pressure 131/77); April 2016 (blood pressure 135/77).

Moreover, the Veteran testified during the December 2024 hearing that his blood pressure is usually in the range of 130-148/90-92.  He also stated that he never had a problem with his blood pressure prior to being prescribed medication for hypertension in 1971.

Based on the foregoing, evidence does not persuasively show that the Veteran has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more or that his diastolic pressure has been predominantly 100 or more or that his systolic pressure has been predominantly 160 or more during the appeal period.  Therefore, the Board finds that an initial compensable evaluation is not warranted for hypertension.

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran and his representative have asserted that he is unable to work at least in part due to his service-connected hypertension.  In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a claim for TDIU is part and parcel of an increased rating claim when such a claim is raised by the record.  However, the Board finds that the issue is inextricably intertwined with the implementation of the grant herein, to include the assignment of an evaluation for the earlier effective date.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

After implementing the grant of an earlier effective date for service connection for hypertension and assigning an initial evaluation for that earlier period, the AOJ should consider whether the Veteran is entitled to TDIU based on impairment attributable to his service-connected disabilities, in accordance with Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).
