REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from February 2016 to January 2017, from December 2020 to December 2021, and from December 2020 to January 2022.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). Here, the December 2023 decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), denied the Veteran's claim to entitlement to service connection for depression, impaired impulse control, insomnia, and tobacco use disorder. The December 2023 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies. 

In January 2024, the Veteran sought Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the depression, impaired impulse control, insomnia, and tobacco use disorder decisions by submitting a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR. In the May 2024 HLR rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim to entitlement to service connection for depression, impaired impulse control, insomnia, and tobacco use disorder. The Veteran appealed that decision by submitting a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As a result, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to service connection for depression is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for impaired impulse control is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for depression, impaired impulse control, and insomnia. He indicated that he has much less patience and severely increased irritability since deployment. He finds himself in really low moods that can lead to suicidal ideation. Moreover, he indicated that he has not been able to sleep well for weeks due to thoughts brought on by his military service. See August 2023 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation, and without a current disability, service connection is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). 

In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records do not show any complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for any acquired psychiatric disorder. See October 2021 STR. The STRs did reflect that the Veteran was bothered a lot by having trouble sleeping. The Veteran was prescribed melatonin. Further, it was noted that he was slightly bothered with being easily annoyed and/or irritable. See October 2021 STR.

The VA treatment records show that his depression screen test conducted throughout the appeal period consistently show negative depression screens. The Veteran admitted feelings of depression but denied suicidal ideation and/or homicidal ideation. The VA treatment records were negative for impaired impulse control and insomnia. See September 2023 CAPRI. 

At the September 2023 VA examination for PTSD, the Veteran was diagnosed with tobacco use disorder. There were not any other psychiatric related diagnoses. The examiner indicated that his mental condition was formally diagnosed, but the symptoms were not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication. The examiner noted psychological symptoms that included depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and flattened affect.

The Board is cognizant that a symptom may be considered a disability even without an underlying diagnosis if it is severe enough to cause occupational impairment. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, psychological claims require diagnosis under Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). See Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (Affirmed the CAVC decision that psychological claims require a DSM-5 diagnosis). In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of depression, impaired impulse control, and insomnia. Further, while the Veteran alleges depression, impaired impulse control, and insomnia there has never been an indication that these conditions cause any occupational impairment. See September 2023 C&P Exam. Thus, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the finding of current disabilities pertaining to the above noted psychiatric related conditions. 

While the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, he is not competent to provide any diagnoses in this case as that requires medical expertise and is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Therefore, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case.  

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for tobacco use disorder is denied.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The Veteran contends that he has current tobacco use disorder which is related to service. His September 2023 VA examination for PTSD indicate that he has been diagnosed as having tobacco use disorder.

Nevertheless, there is no express basis on which to award service connection for tobacco use itself. See generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4 (VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities) (no reference to a separate disability rating for tobacco use). Further, for claims filed after June 9, 1998, as in the instant case, service connection may not be granted on the basis that a disability resulted from disease or injury attributable to the use of tobacco products during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1103 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.300.

VA's General Counsel has held, however, that neither 38 U.S.C. § 1103 (a) nor 38 C.F.R. § 3.300 bars the award of service connection and payment of VA disability compensation for a tobacco-related disability that is caused or aggravated by tobacco use due to a primary service-connected disability. See VAOGCPREC 6-2003. When assessing this type of issue, the following questions must be resolved: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the Veteran to use tobacco products after service; (2) if so, whether the use of tobacco products as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing a secondary disability; and (3) whether the secondary disability would not have occurred but for the use of tobacco products caused by the service-connected disability. 

In this case, the Veteran is not service connected for any disability and is not claiming that his tobacco use is secondary to any other disability. Rather, he is claiming service connection for the mere usage of tobacco because he contends that his current tobacco use is related to his tobacco use in service. Thus, the provisions of VAOGCPREC 6-2003 do not apply in this instance.

In sum, there is no legal basis to award service connection for tobacco use disorder as a separate disability. Consequently, service connection for tobacco use disorder is not warranted.
