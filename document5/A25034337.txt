ORDER

A compensable disability rating for service-connected linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair is denied.

A 10 percent disability rating for status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair is not painful or unstable.

2.  The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating warranted for limitation of motion of the left (minor) pinky finger; however, as his residuals of status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger results in pain, difficulty with lifting, grabbing, and certain movements after repeated use of the left hand, and decreased grip strength, his symptoms are rated as analogous to impairment of Muscle Group IX.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for service-connected linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

2. The criteria for a 10 percent disability rating for service-connected status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5230, 4.73, Diagnostic Code 5309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army with active duty from 

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 higher-level review rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In that rating decision, the RO continued the denial of a compensable disability rating for linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair and continued the denial of a compensable disability rating for status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger.

In May 2024, the RO received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement, in which the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 5, 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes. See 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran. 38?C.F.R. §?4.3.  When the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran is accorded the benefit of the doubt.  38?U.S.C. §?5107 (b).  Furthermore, staged ratings are appropriate in any increased-rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms or differing levels of severity can be identified.  See Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).

1. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for service-connected linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair.

The Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for scar of the left pinky, status post tendon repair in May 2023.  He has not provided statements in support of this contention or any reasons why he believes the scar of the left only finger warrants a higher disability rating. 

The Veteran's scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804 for unstable or painful scar(s).

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating.  Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating.  Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 instructs that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Id.  

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7804 because the Veteran's linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair is not manifest by one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  In this regard, a July 2023 VA examination reveals that the Veteran had a healed scar on the left pinky.  It was not painful or unstable with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  Diagnostic Code 7800 addresses scars of the head, face, or neck.  Under Diagnostic Code 7801 burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage with an area or areas of at least 6 square inches (39 sq. cm.) but less than 12 square inches (77 sq. cm.) warrants a 10 percent disability rating.  Under Diagnostic Code 7802, scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage with an area or areas of 144 square inches or 929 sq. cm. or greater warrant a 10 percent disability rating.  Diagnostic Code 7805 provides that any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 should be evaluated under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.

However, the Veteran's scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and nonlinear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Although it is superficial and not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, it does not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches or greater.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 through 7802 are inapplicable.  Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under Diagnostic Code 7805.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms.  However, in this case, the Veteran did not provide any lay evidence regarding the issue of whether his scar is painful.  As such, the only evidence of record during the relevant evidentiary window is the July 2023 VA examination which documents that the Veteran's scar of the left pinky is not painful.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for linear scar of the left pinky finger, status post tendon repair.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for residuals of status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger.

The Veteran submitted an increased rating claim for status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger in May 2023.  He contends that he experiences residuals of pain in the fifth finger with limited movement.  He also has pain with lifting, grabbing, carrying stuff, and physical activity. See July 2023 VA examination. 

The Veteran's status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger is currently evaluated as noncompensable under left finger disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5228, which evaluates limitation of motion of or ring or little finger.  In this case limitation of motion of the finders are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5228 (thumb), 5259 (index or long finger), and 5230 (ring or little finger).  For limitation of the motion of the thumb, a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers warrants a noncompensable disability rating, whether on the major (dominant) or minor (non-dominant) hand.  A gap of one to two inches (2.5 cm to 5.1 cm) between the thumb pad and the fingers with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers warrants a 10 percent disability rating, whether on the major (dominant) or minor (non-dominant) hand.  A 20 percent rating is warranted when the gap is more than two inches (5.1 cm), with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5228.

Regarding limitation of motion in the index or long finger, a noncompensable rating is warranted if there is a gap of less than one inch (2.5cm) between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible; andr extension is limited by no more than 30 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when there is a gap of one inch (2.5cm) or more between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible; or with extension limited by more than 30 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5229. 

Diagnostic Code 5230 provides a maximum zero percent rating for any limitation of motion of the ring or little finger, whether on the major (dominant) or minor (non-dominant) hand.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5230.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38?C.F.R. §?4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing  38?C.F.R. §?4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement  See DeLuca v. Brown,?8?Vet. App.?202 (1995);?see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to?38?C.F.R. §?4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

A finding of functional loss due to pain, however, must be supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40;?Johnston v. Brown, 10?Vet. App.?80, 85 (1997).?  Under?38?C.F.R. §?4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however,?38?C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).  In?Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of?38?C.F.R. §?4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  In?Sharp v. Shulkin, 29?Vet. App.?26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.?

The July 2023 VA examination shows that the Veteran reported that he sustained laceration to the base of the fifth left finger in the 2000's.  He underwent surgical tendon repair.  He experiences residuals of pain in the fifth finger with limited movement.  The Veteran explained that he has residual pain with lifting, grabbing, carrying stuff, and physical activity.  He takes motrin 800 mg as needed.  The Veteran denied having flare-ups.  He stated that he had trouble lifting, grabbing, and certain movements after repeated use over time.  

Based on the evidence of record, the most pertinent of which was discussed above, the Board finds that the symptoms of the Veteran's residuals of status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger do not warrant a compensable disability rating under Diagnostic Codes 5203.  In this regard, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted for any range of motion of the ring or little finger.  Although there is evidence of painful motion of the left fifth (pinky) finger, a compensable rating is warranted for joint pain pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 for orthopedic disabilities only if they are rated under diagnostic codes containing a 10 percent rating.  See Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472, 480 (2016); Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415, 428-29 (2015).  As Diagnostic Code 5230 does not contain a 10 percent rating, the Veteran cannot receive a 10 percent disability for painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. 

Disability evaluations are also available for ankylosis of the finger joints and injuries to the muscles arising from the internal and external condyle of the humerus that affect extension and flexion of the fingers.  The evidence of record shows the Veteran does not have ankylosis of any finger joint.

Nonetheless, the medical evidence of record reflects that the muscle strength testing showed four out of five for left hand grip in the July 2023 VA examination.  The Veteran reported in the July 2023 VA examination that he experienced pain with lifting, grabbing, carrying stuff, and physical activity.  The examiner documented that the Veteran had trouble lifting, grabbing, and certain movements after repeated use over time.  The Veteran worked as a special police officer and the examiner determined that the Veteran's status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger impacts his ability to perform any type of occupational task.  The examiner explained that the Veteran reported pain to his left hand with lifting and grabbing due to his status post tendon repair of the fifth finger.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the disability picture in this case is akin to that of impairment to muscle group IX.  Diagnostic Code 5309 documents that the functions of Muscle Group IX are the following: forearm muscles act in strong grasping movements and are supplemented by the intrinsic muscles in delicate manipulative movements. Intrinsic muscles of hand include thenar eminence; short flexor, opponens, abductor and adductor of thumb; hypothenar eminence; short flexor, opponens and abductor of little finger; 4 lumbricales; 4 dorsal and 3 palmar interossei.  When an unlisted condition is encountered it is permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but also the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous.  Conjectural analogous will be avoided, as will the use of analogous ratings for conditions of doubtful diagnosis, or for those not fully supported by clinical and laboratory findings, nor will ratings assigned to organic disease and injuries be assigned by analogy to conditions of functional origin.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  Diagnostic Code 5309, directs that the Muscle Group IX should be rated on limitation of motion with a minimum rating of 10 percent, because the hand is so compact a structure that isolated muscle injuries are rare, being nearly always complicated with injuries of bones, joints, tendons  As there is objective evidence of reduced muscle strength with hand grip rated a four out of five in conjunction with the Veteran experiencing pain and difficulty with lifting, grabbing, and certain movements after repeated use of the left hand, an analogous rating of 10 percent, which is the minimum rating allowed for evaluating disabilities of Muscle Group IX, is warranted for residuals of status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger under 38 C.F.R. § 4.73, Diagnostic Code 5309.  The Veteran is not entitled to a disability rating higher than 10 percent as 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5230, which evaluates limitation of motion of the little finger, does not provide a rating higher than 10 percent for limitation of motion of the little finger.  

As discussed above, the Board finds that there is no basis for the assignment of any higher rating based on consideration of any of the factors addressed in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45 and DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 204-7.  Competent medical evidence reflects that the currently assigned 10 percent rating properly compensates him for the extent of functional loss resulting from any such symptoms.  Although it was noted in the examination report that the Veteran exhibited pain on motion, as well as decreased grip strength, these findings have already been taken into consideration in the assignment of the current 10 percent rating.

Finally, the Board acknowledges that if the applicable Diagnostic Code does not specifically contemplate the effects of medication, the Board is required to discount the ameliorative effects of medication when evaluating the disability.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 61 (2012).  In this case, the rating criteria used to evaluate the Veteran's status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger does not reference medication use.  Thus, the Board must discount any beneficial medication effects.  Nonetheless, the Veteran reported in the July 2023 VA treatment record that he takes Motrin 800 mg as needed.  Therefore, the evidence indicates that the Veteran's range of motion was evaluated during a time when he was not using medication.  Furthermore, as the Veteran reported that he only takes Motrin as needed, it is logical to infer that the Veteran takes the medication after repeated use over time causes an increase symptoms and therefore, the range of motion estimates for repeated use over time provided by the examiner already discount any ameliorative effects of medication.  In addition, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum disability rating and therefore, even if the examiner had not discounted the ameliorative effective of medication, it would not have impacted the disability assigned by the Board.

In conclusion, the evidence shows that the Veteran's status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger more nearly approximates impairment of function of Muscle Group IX due to pain, reduced range of motion, and reduced muscle grip. Thus, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for service-connected status post tendon repair of the left fifth finger.
