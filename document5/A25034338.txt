Entitlement to service connection for a recurrent leg disability to include shin splints disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 2006 to February 2010.  He served in Iraq. 

In April 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for a recurrent left knee disability.  In November 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for plantar fasciitis and shin splints.  In December 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for sleep apnea.  In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, as the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a recurrent sleep disability to include obstructive sleep apnea, a recurrent bilateral foot disability to include plantar fasciitis, a recurrent left knee disability, and a recurrent leg disability to include shin splints disability is remanded.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should obtain all relevant service documentation which could potentially be helpful in resolving the Veteran's claim. Murphy v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 78 (1990); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).  

The record reflects that the Veteran served in the Marine Corps Reserve from February 2006 to February 2013.  The Veteran's complete periods of active duty, active duty for training, and inactive duty for training with the Marine Corps Reserve have not been verified and the service treatment records associated with such service have not been requested.  This is a pre-decisional error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Contact the National Personnel Record Center (NPRC) and/or the appropriate service entity and request that (1) it verify the Veteran's complete periods of active duty, active duty for training, and inactive duty for training with the Marine Corps Reserve and (2) forward all 

 

available service treatment records associated with such duty for incorporation into the record.
