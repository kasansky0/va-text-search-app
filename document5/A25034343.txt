FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's FSAD is rated as non-compensable, which is the maximum schedular rating permitted for FSAD.

2. The Veteran's uterine fibroid did not result in a complete or incomplete pelvic organ prolapse due to injury, disease, or surgical complications of pregnancy.

3. The Veteran's Bartholin's cyst did not require continuous treatment.

4. The Veteran's chest and abdomen scars cover an area of 132 square cm and were not painful, unstable with loss of covering, or involving underlying tissue damage.

5. The competing lay and medical evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran has a current heart palpitations disability that began in service and persisted to the present time. Thus, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the appellant.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had TMJ at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of finding the Veteran's bruxism began in service.

8. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had floaters at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

9. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had chronic conjunctivitis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

10. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the Veteran's dry eye disability began in service.

11. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a left wrist strain at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

12. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a right wrist strain at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

13. The competing lay and medical evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran has a current right hand Raynaud's condition that began in service. Thus, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the appellant. 

14. The competing lay and medical evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether the Veteran's tinnitus began in service. Thus, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the appellant.

15. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a left lower extremity disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

16. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a left upper extremity disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

17. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a right lower extremity disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance. 

18. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had a right upper extremity disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2009 to April 2023.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from July 2023 and September 2023 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

Relevant to this appeal, the July 2023 decision awarded service connection for FSAD, a uterine fibroid, and chest and abdomen scars rated as noncompensable. Service connection for bilateral dry eye, floaters, conjunctivitis, heart palpitations, bilateral upper extremities, bilateral lower extremities, bilateral wrists, tinnitus, and TMJ was denied. The September 2023 decision granted service connection for a Bartholin's cyst and awarded a noncompensable rating. 

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence or record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision for all issues on appeal but for the cyst. Regarding the cyst, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The period on appeal for all issues begins with the Veteran's December 2022 date of claim (under the Benefits Delivery at Discharge or BDD program). However, the Veteran did not separate from active service until April 13, 2023. Therefore, all of the benefits granted in the July 2023 and September 2023 decisions were given an effective date beginning the day after her separation, April 14, 2023. 

Neither the Veteran nor representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board...to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

Increased Ratings

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the Veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and coordination of rating with impairment of function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of her disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for FSAD.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a uterine fibroid.

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for Bartholin's cyst.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for her FSAD, uterine fibroid, and a Bartholin's cyst. 

The Veteran's FSAD is rated under DC 7632. A noncompensable rating is the highest allowable rating for FSAD under this criterion. This disability is compensated through her existing award of special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ. under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350, effective April 14, 2023.

The Veteran's fibroid is rated under DC 7621-7613. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Under DC 7621, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a complete or incomplete pelvic organ prolapse due to injury, disease, or surgical complications of pregnancy. The note states pelvic organ prolapse occurs when a pelvic organ such as bladder, urethra, uterus, vagina, small bowel, or rectum drops (prolapses) from its normal place in the abdomen. Conditions associated with pelvic organ prolapse include: uterine or vaginal vault prolapse, cystocele, urethrocele, rectocele, enterocele, or any combination thereof. Evaluate pelvic organ prolapse under DC 7621. Evaluate separately any genitourinary, digestive, or skin symptoms under the appropriate diagnostic code(s) and combine all evaluations with the 10 percent evaluation under DC 7621. 

The Veteran's uterine fibroid is also rated under DC 7613 and her cyst is rated under DC 7611. 38 C.F.R. § 4.116. Disabilities rated under these diagnostic codes are rated using the General Rating Formula for Disease, Injury, or Adhesions of Female Reproductive Organs. Under the general rating formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for symptoms that do not require continuous treatment. A 10 percent rating is assigned for symptoms that require continuous treatment. A maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for symptoms that are not controlled by continuous treatment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.116 General Rating Formula for Disease, Injury, or Adhesions of Female Reproductive Organs.

Continuous is defined as "marked by uninterrupted extension in space, time, or sequence." See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continuous. Within this meaning of the term, a 10 percent rating would only be warranted upon a showing that a claimant required constant treatment, without cessation. Intermittent flare-ups of symptoms, even requiring prolonged treatment, would not meet the criteria necessary for a 10 percent rating.

The Veteran was awarded a VA gynecological conditions examination in May 2023. She was diagnosed with a uterine fibroid, Bartholin's cyst, and FSAD. The Veteran denied seeking medical care for FSAD and cysts in the past 12 months. The examiner indicated the Veteran had irregular periods as a result of her diagnoses, but she had not received any treatment for this symptom. Further, the Veteran does not currently require treatment for symptoms related to reproductive tract conditions. No disease, injuries, or other conditions of the vulva, clitoris, vagina, cervix, fallopian tubes, or ovaries were noted. There was no evidence of a hysterectomy or oophorectomy. The Veteran had not undergone menopause and did not have complete atrophy of either fallopian tube. No incontinence issues, fistulae issues, endometriosis, pelvic organ prolapse, or tumors were reported. No other pertinent physical findings were indicated. 

Regarding the Veteran's FSAD and uterine fibroid, there is no additional evidence for review in the applicable evidentiary window. Under DC 7632 for FSAD, the Veteran is already receiving the highest possible rating, which is noncompensable. Additionally, the Veteran is already receiving special monthly compensation for loss of use of a creative organ for the entire appeal period. Therefore, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for FSAD under DC 7632 is not warranted. 

An initial compensable rating for a uterine fibroid is also not warranted. The May 2023 VA examination specifically found there were no pelvic organ prolapses. Therefore, a compensable rating under DC 7621 for fibroids is not warranted. The May 2023 examiner also found the Veteran did not require any treatment for her gynecological conditions. Rather, the Veteran denied seeking treatment in the past 12 months. As the Veteran's uterine fibroid does not require continuous treatment, an initial compensable rating for a uterine fibroid under DC 7613 is not warranted. 

The Veteran was afforded an additional VA gynecological examination in September 2023. This examination is outside the evidentiary window for all of the claims except for the cyst. She reported intermittent mild pain, pelvic pressure, irregular menstruation, dysmenorrhea associated with ovarian dysfunction, frequent or continuous menstrual disturbances, heavy periods lasting from two weeks occurring twice a month. The Veteran sought treatment in 2018, but her cyst did not require treatment for her symptoms. No disease, injuries, or other conditions of the vulva, clitoris, vagina, or fallopian tubes were noted. The examiner indicated the Veteran had a cervix condition but only indicated a leep procedure was performed. The examiner explained the leep procedure resolved an abnormal PAP smear and there was no diagnosis indicated. No diagnosis specific to her cervix was provided. There was no evidence of a hysterectomy or oophorectomy. The Veteran had not undergone menopause and did not have complete atrophy of either fallopian tube. The examiner indicated the Veteran had ovarian cysts. She also had stress incontinence unrelated to her gynecological conditions. No fistulae issues, endometriosis, pelvic organ prolapse, or tumors were reported. No other pertinent physical findings were indicated. 

Regarding the Veteran's cyst, no continuous treatment was indicated by the May 2023 or September 2023 VA examiners. The Veteran also denied treatment in May 2023 and did not report any new treatment in the September 2023 VA examination. While she reported pain and prolonged periods, those symptoms are contemplated by her noncompensable rating "for symptoms that do not require continuous treatment." Therefore, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for cyst under DC 7611 is not warranted. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to an initial compensable rating for FSAD, uterine fibroid, and cyst is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application when the evidence is persuasively for or against the claim). The claim is denied.

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for a chest and abdomen scars 

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for her chest and abdomen scars, which is rated under Diagnostic Code 7802.

Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's chest and abdomen scars are do not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for scars in May 2023. Here, the examiner indicated scars on her bilateral areolas, bilateral posterior breasts, and lower abdomen. The scars on her bilateral areolas were circular while the others were linear horizontal. All of her scars were noted to be healed. None of the scars were on her head, face, or neck. Her scars were neither reported to be painful nor were they unstable with frequent loss of covering. No burn scars were indicated. The Veteran's right areola scar was measured to be 8cm long by 12cm wide. Her left areola scar was the same. The Veteran's right posterior and left posterior breast scars were both 10cm long by 1cm wide. Her lower abdomen scar was 16cm long by 1cm wide. The total area affected of the anterior trunk was 132cm squared. None of these scars were tender to palpitation, unstable, or involved underlying soft tissue damage. The scars did not result in a limitation of function and no additional pertinent findings were reported. 

As the total area affected was no more than 132cm squared, an initial compensable rating for her chest and abdomen scars is not warranted under DC 7802. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. However, the Veteran's scars are not of the head, face, or neck, are not deep and non-linear, and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Moreover, the Veteran's scars are not unstable or painful. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, and 7804 are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under Diagnostic Code 7805. Specifically, the Veteran has not made any assertions regarding symptoms related to her scars and the May 2023 VA examiner found they do not result in any functional loss.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to an initial compensable rating for chest and abdomen scars is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding her scars covered an area of 929cm squared or more. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

Service Connection

In seeking VA disability compensation, a Veteran generally seeks to establish that a current disability results from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110. "Service connection" basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381, F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

5. Entitlement to service connection for heart palpitations

The Veteran seeks service connection for heart palpitations.

The Veteran began reporting the new onset of heart palpitations in July 2018 while pregnant. She continued to report palpitations in August 2018, October 2018, and January 2019. However, days later in January 2019, she denied having palpitations. A November 2020 stress test resulted in palpitations and in January 2021 she reported rarely having palpitations. She was provided an ECG in July 2022 due to her reports of heart palpitations but denied having them in August 2022. In August 2022, the Veteran denied palpitations and they were found to have resolved post-partum. However, the Veteran reported heart symptoms to include palpitations in November 2022, but no irregular beats were found by the Holter monitor.  

The Veteran underwent a VA separation health assessment in March 2023 where no heart related issues were reported. The examiner provided a list of the Veteran's claimed conditions and their current diagnoses. While the Veteran claimed heart palpitations the examiner noted a diagnosis of "acute only heart palpitations, resolved." The Veteran was also afforded a VA heart conditions examination in March 2023 where she was diagnosed with acute only heart palpitations, resolved. However, the Veteran continued to report "random episodes of palpitations that is attributed to anxiety." 

The Board acknowledges that there is no current medical finding of heart arrythmia. However, the Veteran's prior reports of palpitations resulted in her 2018 diagnosis, and she has continued to report the same symptoms thereafter. The occurrence of her palpitations also appears to come and go but she has continued to report experiencing palpitations since 2018. The Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of her heart palpitations to include reporting similar symptoms that has previously led to a diagnosis in service. As the Veteran's reports made during the March 2023 VA examination are consistent with the other medical evidence of record, she is also found to be credible. 

Thus, considering the totality of the evidence of record, the Veteran has a current heart palpitations condition that onset in service, as such service connection is warranted. Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"). The competent and credible evidence is in approximate balance to show this disability "was incurred coincident with service." 38 C.F.R. 3.303 (a). The Board finds the Veteran's heart palpitations were incurred coincident with service and has continued to the present day.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to service connection for heart palpitations is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine applies. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is granted.

6. Entitlement to service connection TMJ.

7. Entitlement to service connection for bruxism.

The Veteran seeks service connection for TMJ and bruxism. 

The Veteran's service treatment records show she reported right ear and jaw pain for 2 days in February 2010. No diagnosis related to the jaw was provided at that time. 

The Veteran was diagnosed with bruxism in a January 2023 dental and oral conditions VA examination. Her current symptoms included clenching which had remained the same since its onset in April 2015. However, in a January 2023 VA examination for temporomandibular disorders (TMD), the examiner declined to provide a TMJ diagnosis. The Veteran reported the same symptom of clenching and some facial discomfort. The examiner clarified that the Veteran's symptoms were that of bruxism and not a TMD, such as TMJ. 

While the Veteran claimed service connection for TMJ and is competent to report on her jaw related symptoms, she is not medically competent to diagnose TMJ. An opinion of that nature requires medical expertise that is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson, and the Veteran does not have relevant medical training, experience, or education to make a diagnosis. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The first and most fundamental requirement for any service-connection claim is the existence of a current disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The Veteran has made no argument or contention that her facial discomfort has impacted her earning capacity. As there is no evidence of a current disability "recent to" or during the pendency of the claim, the Board finds that that the first element of service connection is not established for TMJ. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Id. The claim for TMJ is denied.

However, the Veteran was diagnosed with bruxism in the January 2023 VA examination, which occurred while she was still on active-duty service. Thus, considering the totality of the evidence of record, the Veteran's current bruxism had its onset in service, as such service connection is warranted. Flynn, 6 Vet. App. 500. The competent and credible persuasively weighs in favor of showing this disability "was incurred coincident with service." 38 C.F.R. 3.303 (a). The Board finds the Veteran's bruxism incurred coincident with service and has continued to the present day.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding entitlement to service connection for bruxism is warranted. The claim for bruxism is granted.

8. Entitlement to service connection for floaters.

9. Entitlement to service connection for chronic conjunctivitis.

10. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral dry eye.

The Veteran seeks service connection for floaters, chronic conjunctivitis, and bilateral dry eye syndrome. 

The claim for service connection was filed in December 2022. The current disability requirement is satisfied when a claimant "has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim," McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), or "when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to... filing a claim for benefits based on that disability." Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

The Veteran's service treatment records show a May 2013 diagnosis for dry eye syndrome. This was diagnosed again in April 2016 as keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The Veteran denied vision problems in January 2019, but her active problems still included dry eye syndrome. In April 2019, her eyes and conjunctiva showed no abnormalities. In an April 2022 eye exam, the Veteran's left and right conjunctiva was normal. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA eye examination in February 2023 where she was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome. The examiner indicated a 2016 diagnosis date and current symptoms to include blurry vision from time to time. However, in the medical history section as reported by the Veteran, the examiner indicated a 2017 onset of conjunctiva. The Veteran reported current symptoms to include dry eyes and a foreign body sensation when blinking. The Veteran also reported floaters in her visual field which began in 2015. However, on examination, the Veteran had "reduced tear up break up in both eyes, indicating dry eye syndrome" as diagnosed in 2016. There were no objective findings of floaters or conjunctivitis on examination. The examiner also found her eye symptoms did not impact her ability to work. 

While the Veteran may believe she has a current diagnosis of a chronic conjunctivitis, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372. The Veteran does not have the medical expertise, training, or experience to interpret testing or evaluate an eye disability. Thus, her lay statements are not competent to establish a current disability.

Furthermore, while the Veteran reported dry eyes, a foreign body sensation when blinking, and floaters, she has made no argument or contention that these symptoms have impacted her earning capacity. Rather, the February 2023 VA examiner specifically found they did not. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current bilateral chronic conjunctivitis condition or floaters.

As there is no evidence of a current disability "recent to" or during the pendency of the claim, the Board finds that that the first element of service connection is not established for the Veteran's chronic conjunctivitis and floaters. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to service connection for chronic conjunctivitis or floaters is warranted. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran has a current chronic conjunctivitis or floater diagnosis. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is denied.

Regarding dry eye syndrome, the July 2023 AOJ decision made two favorable findings. First that the Veteran has a current dry eye syndrome diagnosis and second that she was treated for such a condition in service. These are favorable findings by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As a result, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.

The Veteran was first diagnosed with dry eye syndrome in 2013 and continued to seek medical care through 2016 and 2019. Her dry eye syndrome diagnosis was confirmed again in the February 2023 VA examination which was conducted while she was still in service. Thus, considering the totality of the evidence of record, the Veteran's current dry eye syndrome had its onset in service. As such service connection for dry eye syndrome is warranted. Flynn, 6 Vet. App. 500. The competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs in favor of showing dry eye syndrome "was incurred coincident with service." 38 C.F.R. 3.303 (a). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding entitlement to service connection for dry eye syndrome is warranted. The claim is granted.

11. Entitlement to service connection for left wrist strain.

12. Entitlement to service connection for right wrist strain.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral wrist strains. 

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain a diagnosis for either a left or right wrist condition. She reported a 6-month history of wrist aching and sharp pain with repetitive motion in October 2022. However, November 2022 x-rays of her bilateral wrist showed "no fractures, dislocation, or abnormal periosteal reaction." The "visualized joint spaces and alignment" were maintained. The "scapholunate and lunotriquetral intervals" were intact and the soft tissues "appeared unremarkable." 

She underwent a VA examination in March 2023 in which the examiner declined to provide a diagnosis for either wrist. The Veteran reported current symptoms to include wrist pain at the bone that radiates up the hand with heavy lifting but denies symptoms with other activities. The examiner explained that the symptoms reported by the Veteran are subjective and "per Veteran report on day of exam only." There is insufficient reports of symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment related to the wrists and her wrist was "grossly normal" on examination. The Veteran was unable to reproduce her reported symptoms and both wrists were noted to be normal. 

As stated above, the first and most fundamental requirement for any service-connection claim is the existence of a current disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Boyer, 210 F.3d 1351; Brammer, 3 Vet. App. 223.

With regards to the lay and medical evidence that the Veteran currently experiences bilateral wrist pain, the Board cannot conclude that this symptom results in a functional impairment in earning capacity. The Veteran has made no argument or contention that these symptoms have impacted her earning capacity. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current bilateral wrist disability, even when considering Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

While the Veteran may believe she has a current diagnosis of a bilateral wrist disability, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372. The Veteran does not have the medical expertise, training, or experience to interpret testing or evaluate a bilateral wrist disability. Thus, her lay statements are not competent to establish a current disability.

As there is no evidence of a current disability "recent to" or during the pendency of the claim, the Board finds that that the first element of service connection is not established. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

The Board has reviewed all medical and lay evidence but finds there is no evidence of record which establishes that the Veteran had a bilateral wrist disability during or recent to the pendency of the appeal. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claims are denied.

13. Entitlement to service connection for right hand disability.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right-hand strain. The issue was certified to the Board as entitlement to service connection for a right-hand strain. However, the Veteran appears to seek service connection for all of her right hand related symptoms, regardless of diagnosis. Thus, the Board has recharacterized the claim more broadly to encompass any right hand condition that causes the claimed symptoms. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (holding that when a claimant makes a claim, she is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled).

The Veteran underwent several VA examinations that discussed her right hand in March 2023. In an artery and vein condition VA examination, the Veteran reported being diagnosed with Raynaud's in service and experience a tingling sensation in her hands and feet. No diagnosis of Raynaud's was provided by the examiner. The examiner explained that there was no evidence in the claims file to show reported symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment for Raynaud's. She underwent a hand examination which also did not provide a Raynaud's diagnosis, and her right hand was noted to be grossly normal. In a peripheral nerve conditions VA examination, the examiner again noted no report of Raynaud's in the claims file. 

However, it appears these examiners did not in fact review the Veteran's claims file in its entirety. Her service treatment records show several reports of Raynaud's related symptoms in 2017. For example, in October 2017, the Veteran reported cold numb fingers that turn white at the tip when exposed to cold. The provider asked she be evaluated for Raynaud's. Days later in October 2017, the Veteran was diagnosed with Raynaud's syndrome without gangrene. This diagnosis came after she reported constantly cold hands with additional pain when exposed to cold temperatures. She made similar reports again in November 2017. As the March 2023 VA examiners did not appear to consider the Veteran's record in its entirety, their findings regarding a lack of diagnosis are inadequate. See Dalton v. Nicholson,?21 Vet. App. 23?(2007). They are afforded no probative weight. 

Rather, the Veteran was diagnosed with Raynaud's in service in October 2017. She continued to report issues into November 2017. The March 2023 VA examiners appear to base their finding of no current disability based on the assumption the Veteran neither reported symptoms of, nor was diagnosed with, Raynaud's in service. However, during the March 2023 hand and finger VA examination, she denied pain but continued to endorse numbness to the fingers. The Veteran continued to report experiencing similar symptoms in March 2023 that she provided in October 2017 that led to her original Raynaud's diagnosis. 

Thus, considering the totality of the evidence of record, the Veteran's current right hand Raynaud's had its onset in service, as such service connection is warranted. Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting that "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty"). The competent and credible evidence is in approximate balance to show this disability "was incurred coincident with service." 38 C.F.R. 3.303 (a). The Board finds the Veteran's right hand Raynaud's was incurred coincident with service and has continued to the present day.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to service connection for right hand Raynaud's is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine applies. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claim is granted.

14. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus. 

Tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore a chronic disease that may be presumptively service connected under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a). Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015).

Tinnitus is "a noise in the ear, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking." See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1956 (31st ed. 2007). Because of its inherently subjective nature, a layman such as the Veteran is considered competent to report the observable manifestations of tinnitus. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002) (holding that tinnitus is subjective and the kind of condition lay testimony is competent to describe). Here, the Veteran reported daily ringing in her ears lasting about 15 second at a time during a January 2023 VA examination. The Board acknowledges the January 2023 VA examiner asserted this did not meet the definition of tinnitus as described by "Dauman and Tyler (1992) cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler)." However, as stated above, tinnitus is a subjective condition capable of self-identification. Thus, the Board resolves doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds she has a current tinnitus disability. 

The July 2023 rating decision found the Veteran's service treatment records note complaints of tinnitus while on active duty. Notably, the Veteran reported daily ringing in her ears during the January 2023 VA examination which was conducted while she was still on active-duty service. The Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of her tinnitus, to include ringing in the ears. The Board finds no reason to doubt her assertions in this matter. 

Thus, considering the totality of the evidence of record, the Veteran's current tinnitus had its onset in service, as such service connection is warranted. Flynn, 6 Vet. App. 500. The persuasive weight of the evidence shows this disability "was incurred coincident with service" with persistence to the present time. 38 C.F.R. 3.303(a). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. The claim is granted.

15. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity numbness and tingling.

16. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity numbness and tingling.

17. Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity numbness and tingling.

18. Entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity numbness and tingling.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral lower and upper extremity numbness and tingling. 

The Veteran's service treatment records show she denied pain/numbness in her extremities in January 2012. An October 2017 upper extremity ultrasounds was normal. She denied leg numbness in February 2018. She reported to the emergency room in January 2019 where she reported headaches and leg numbness. She was treated for hypertension at that time and her hypertension medication was refilled. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for her neck, thoracolumbar spine, diabetes, and peripheral nervous system conditions in March 2023. During the neck examination, the Veteran denied radiating symptoms down both upper extremities. No signs or symptoms of radiculopathy resulting from the neck were found. Likewise, during the thoracolumbar spine examination, she again denied reports of pain radiating down both lower extremities. No reports of radiating pain were noted in the diabetes examination and there were no findings of diabetic neuropathy. In the peripheral nerve condition examination, the Veteran reported Reynard's in the fingers and toes but no reports of bilateral upper or lower extremity symptoms. All nerve testing was normal with no peripheral nerve conditions noted. During a March 2023 artery and vein conditions VA examination, the Veteran reported swelling in the legs and pain with prolonged sitting or standing.

The Veteran has not reported any symptoms related to her bilateral upper extremities. With regards to the Veteran's reports of leg swelling and pain with prolonged sitting and standing, the Board cannot conclude that this symptom results in a functional impairment in earning capacity. The Veteran has made no argument or contention that these symptoms have impacted her earning capacity. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a current bilateral upper and lower extremity disability, even when considering Saunders, 886 F.3d 1356.

While the Veteran may believe she has current diagnoses for a bilateral upper and lower extremity disability, she is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77 n.4. The Veteran does not have the medical expertise, training, or experience to interpret testing or evaluate a bilateral upper and lower extremity disability. Thus, her lay statements are not competent to establish a current disability.

As there is no evidence of a current disability "recent to" or during the pendency of the claim, the Board finds that that the first element of service connection is not established. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.

The Board has reviewed all medical and lay evidence but finds there is no evidence of record which establishes that the Veteran had a bilateral upper or lower extremity disability during or recent to the pendency of the appeal. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. The claims are denied.
