ORDER

FINDING OF FACT

In August 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) was notified that the Veteran died in August 2024.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, secondary to the service-connected tinnitus, at this time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205, 20.1302.

2. Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 7, 2023 for the increased rating of 30 percent for the service-connected insomnia disability, at this time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205, 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from April 1985 to April 1989 and from February 1991 to March 1991.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for veterans disagreeing with VA's decision on their claim. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a two AMA rating decisions issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), previously referred to as the Regional Office (RO), in October 2023 and March 2024.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, in part, found that new and relevant evidence was received to readjudicate the claim for service connection for migraine headaches, secondary to the service-connected tinnitus, but denied the claim on the merits. The AOJ also found that clear and unmistakable error occurred when the AOJ previously assigned an effective date of July 17, 2023 for the increased rating of 30 percent for the service-connected insomnia disability. The AOJ proposed an effective date of August 7, 2023.

In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ changed the effective date for the increased rating of 30 percent for the service-connected insomnia disability from July 17, 2023 to August 7, 2023.

In October 2024, a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) was filed, requesting Direct Review by the Board. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal for the headache claim and the March 2024 rating decision for the insomnia claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the claimant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, secondary to the service-connected tinnitus, is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to August 7, 2023 for the increased rating of 30 percent for the service-connected insomnia disability is dismissed. 

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Specifically, as noted previously, in August 2024, VA was notified that he died earlier the same month. As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994). This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision. This process is called substitution. The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (b). To file a request for substitution, a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant" must be submitted. Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution. A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title...." 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (a). 

Based on the foregoing, the Board must dismiss both claims for lack of jurisdiction.
