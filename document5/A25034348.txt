FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against an effective date before August 11, 2022, for the 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

2. The evidence weighs persuasively against an effective date before August 11, 2022, for the grant of entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

3. VA received the Veteran's most recent VA Form 21-526EZ application for an increased rating for PTSD on August 2, 2023.

4. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a rating decision in November 2023 that granted a 100 percent rating for PTSD effective August 2, 2023, the date VA received the most recent VA Form VA Form 21-526EZ application for an increased rating.

5. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review and sought an earlier effective date for the increase to 100 percent.

6. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a higher-level review decision in December 2023 that assigned August 11, 2022, the date VA had received a previous VA Form 21-526EZ, as the new effective date for the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD.

7. The Veteran did not continuously pursue an increased rating claim for PTSD as defined by applicable regulations, including increased rating claims received before August 11, 2022.

8. It was not ascertainable that the criteria for a 100 percent rating were warranted until the August 2023 application and examination were received.

9. It was not ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within the one year prior to receipt of the application.

10. The effective date for the Veteran's 100 percent disability rating and permanent total disability is August 11, 2022. 

11. A total rating was not assigned before August 11, 2022, and the Veteran does not meet the other criteria for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance before that date.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date before August 11, 2022, for the 100 percent rating for PTSD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for an effective date before August 11, 2022, for eligibility to Chapter 35 Dependents' Educational Assistance have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2015 to May 2018.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision that granted earlier effective dates of August 11, 2022 for the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD and eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance. The Veterans submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2024 and elected the Direct Review docket.

The Veteran listed multiple rating decisions on the VA Form 10182, including several that the Notice of Disagreement was untimely to appeal. However, the Veteran made clear that she was seeking an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating and eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance before August 11, 2022, and did include the December 2023 rating decision as one of the decisions she wished to appeal. As such, the Board construes the VA Form 10182 as seeking effective dates before August 11, 2022 for both the 100 percent rating and eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance, as addressed in the December 2023 rating decision. 

The December 2023 decision on appeal is a Higher-Level Review decision. In December 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review that sought review of a November 2023 rating decision that had initially granted the 100 percent rating for her PTSD and eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance. In reviewing a Higher-Level Review decision, the Board's review is partially limited to the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the Veteran requested higher-level review. As a result, this decision can only consider the evidence of record when November 2023 rating decision was issued on November 20, 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claim, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Effective Date

For an award of increased compensation, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim for an increase or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). Specific to claims for increased disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if a claim is received by VA within one year after that date. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

1. Entitlement to an effective date before August 11, 2022, for the 100 percent rating for PTSD.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the assigned 100 percent rating for her PTSD. The current effective date is August 11, 2022, which is the date VA received one of the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ applications seeking an increased rating for her PTSD. The Veteran generally argues that she has continuously pursued a higher rating for her PTSD since at least March 2021, when VA received her first application seeking an increased rating for her PTSD. 

The Veteran filed her initial application for service connection for PTSD in November 2019. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision February 2020 that granted service connection for unspecified trauma and stressor disorder and assigned an initial 50 percent rating effective November 5, 2019, the date the Veteran's application was received. The Veteran was notified of this decision in a letter dated February 12, 2020.

The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim on March 16, 2020. On March 24, 2021, over a year after the intent to file a claim was received, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-526EZ application seeking an increased rating for her unspecified trauma and stressor disorder. In April 2021, the AOJ issued a rating decision recharacterizing the Veteran's disorder to PTSD and continuing the 50 percent rating. The Veteran was notified of this decision in a letter dated April 29, 2021.

The Veteran submitted new VA Form 21-526EZ applications seeking an increased rating for her PTSD on February 21, 2022, and March 20, 2022. The AOJ issued another rating decision in May 2022 continuing the 50 percent rating for the Veterans' PTSD. She was notified of this decision in a letter dated May 24, 2022.

On August 11, 2022, the Veteran submitted another new VA Form 21-526EZ application seeking an increased rating for her PTSD. This claim was denied in a November 2022 rating decision because the Veteran had failed to report to a VA examination without good cause, and a decision was made based on the evidence of record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b). The Veteran was notified of this decision in a letter dated November 15, 2022.

On February 9, 2023, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-526EZ application seeking an increased rating for her PTSD. This claim was also denied in a March 2023 rating decision, again because the Veteran had failed to report to a VA examination without good cause. She was notified of this decision in a letter dated March 13, 2023.

Finally, the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim on August 2, 2023, and submitted her most recent VA Form 21-526EZ application on August 11, 2023 seeking an increased rating for her PTSD. The Veteran also submitted a copy of a PTSD disability benefits questionnaire completed in 2023 by a private psychologist. This examination showed the Veteran's symptoms caused total occupational and social impairment, which is consistent with a 100 percent rating for PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411. In November 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision increasing the rating for the Veteran's PTSD to 100 percent effective August 2, 2023, the date VA received her intent to file a claim. 

In December 2023, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review and sought an earlier effective date for the increase to 100 percent. She argued that she had filed multiple claims for increased ratings in the past three years and had continuously pursued an increase since 2021. The AOJ issued the higher-level review decision on appeal in December 2023 and assigned August 11, 2022 as the new effective date for the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD.

As noted above, the effective date of an increase in compensation will typically be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to the increase arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1). When VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary within one year of receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)

The Veteran had filed an intent to file a claim on August 2, 2023, and a VA Form 21-526EZ application seeking an increased rating for PTSD was received on the August 11, 2023. The AOJ then issued the November 2023 rating decision and granted a 100 percent rating effective August 2, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file. Without considering any continuous pursuit, August 2, 2023 would be the earliest available effective date for the 100 percent rating.

In the December 2023 higher-level review rating decision on appeal, the AOJ found that the Veteran had continuously pursued her claim for an increased rating for PTSD since she submitted the August 11, 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ application that sought a higher rating for the PTSD. The Board is bound by this favorable finding and will not disturb the effective date chosen by the AOJ in the December 2023 decision on appeal. However, "continuous pursuit" is defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). As defined by regulation, the evidence does not demonstrate the Veteran continuously pursued the August 11, 2022 increased rating claim as defined by relevant regulations, nor did she continuously pursue any of the earlier claims she submitted. 

Following notice of a decision on an initial claim, a Veteran may continuously pursue a claim by filing a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). A supplemental claim is filed by submitting a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. A request for higher-level review is filed by submitting a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review. An appeal to the Board is filed by submitting a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). When a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing any of these available review options within one year of the issuance of a prior rating decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h).

The initial claim for service connection for PTSD was received in November 2019, and service connection for unspecified trauma and stressor disorder was granted in a rating decision issued on February 12, 2020. The Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-536EZ application seeking an increased rating on March 24, 2021. The claim for an increased rating received in March 2021 did not constitute continuous pursuit of the November 2019 initial claim, as the March 2021 application was received over a year after the February 12, 2020 rating decision was issued. 

The March 24, 2021 application for an increase was denied in a rating decision issued on April 29, 2021. Thereafter, the Veteran filed multiple new VA Form 21-526EZ applications seeking higher ratings for her PTSD. Following the April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran file a VA Form 21-526EZ in February 2022 and March 2022 that were denied in a May 2022 rating decision. She then filed another VA Form 21-526EZ claim in August 2022 that was denied in a November 2022 rating decision, then another VA Form 21-526EZ claim in February 2023 that was denied in a March 2023 rating decision. Finally, she filed an application for a higher rating in August 2023, which led to the 100 percent rating being assigned effective August 11, 2022.

Each VA Form 21-526EZ listed above was received within one year of the prior rating decision that had denied a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD. However, the Veteran did not submit one of the review options listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c) that would constitute continuous pursuit. She did not file a request for a higher-level review, a supplemental claim, or file an appeal to the Board until the higher-level review was received in December 2023, and then the VA Form 10182 appeal was received in August 2024. Rather, all prior claims for an increased rating for PTSD were filed on new VA Form 21-526Z applications. These constituted new claims for an increased rating rather than continuous pursuit of prior claims under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. A VA Form 21-526EZ application is considered a new claim for benefits and cannot generally initiate continuous pursuit as defined under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028,?2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (decided March 13, 2025). When addressing whether a VA Form 21-8940 application for a TDIU could constitute a supplemental claim, the Court explained while a supplemental claim needs to be filed on a form prescribed by the Secretary, a supplemental claim need not be filed on the specific supplemental claim form. Id. at 20. 

The issue in Chisholm can be distinguished from the issue presented in this case regarding continuous pursuit and supplemental claims forms, in that a VA Form 21-8940 request for a TDIU is not considered a standalone claim for a TDIU but is instead considered by VA to be an attempt to obtain the correct higher rating. Id. The Court's decision in Chisholm was premised around finding that an application for a TDIU, which is never considered a standalone claim, may serve as a supplemental claim when filed after VA has already denied higher ratings for the disabilities at issue. Id. However, even if the Veteran's VA Form 21-526Z applications can be considered continuous pursuit of the initial claim for an increased received on March 24, 2021, an effective date before August 11, 2022, is not compelled by the regulations dictating continuous pursuit. The rules for effective dates for claims that are continuously pursued are outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h) and will either be the date of receipt of the initial claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. This is the same as the default rule for increased ratings under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o), which states an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. While the Veteran's initial claim for an increase was received on March 24, 2021, entitlement to a 100 percent rating for her PTSD arose later. 

The Veteran's PTSD is rated under Diagnostic Code 9411, which pertains specifically to PTSD. Under Diagnostic Code 9411, a 50 percent evaluation is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory for example, retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

A 70 percent rating requires occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent rating requires total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for close relatives' names, own occupation, or own name. Id.

Here, the Veteran was provided VA PTSD examinations in April 2021 and April 2022 that showed impairment consistent with a rating much lower than the total occupational and social impairment required for a 100 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 and Diagnostic Code 9411. It was only upon receipt of the private PTSD disability benefits questionnaire in August 2023 that it was factually ascertainable the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused total occupational and social impairment and that a 100 percent rating was warranted. Both the April 2021 and April 2022 examiners estimated the Veteran's symptoms caused impairment most consistent with a lower 30 percent rating. 

Although the two VA examinations reveal a high level of social impairment, during the April 2022 examination, the Veteran reported relationships with friends and family in her community, and she reported working as an insurance sales agent with a company that she had been with for about five years. This evidence indicates her level of occupational impairment was not total, as she remained employed. In contrast, the private disability benefits questionnaire received in August 2023 showed much greater impairment caused by the Veteran's PTSD symptoms. During that examination, the Veteran reported she had no friends and difficult relationships with her partner and children, the private psychologist determined she was unable to establish or maintain effective relationships, and the Veteran was effectively no longer capable of working due to her PTSD symptoms. It was not factually ascertainable that the criteria for a 100 percent rating were warranted until the August 2023 application and examination were received. The current effective date is August 11, 2022, well before the examination was received. An earlier effective date would not be warranted even considering the rules regarding continuous pursuit.

Notably, many of the most severe symptoms attributed to the Veteran's PTSD were first identified by the private examination submitted in August 2023. Specifically, the private psychologist noted dissociative reactions, distorted cognitions, panic attacks, near-continuous panic or depression, memory loss, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, and obsessional rituals for the first time. None of these symptoms were noted in the April 2021 or April 2022 VA examinations. The August 2023 examination does show suicidal ideation, which was present in VA treatment records before this examination. Although suicidal ideations had been noted in VA treatment records as early as September 2021, suicidal ideation is contemplated by a 70 percent rating and alone does not demonstrate that a 100 percent rating is warranted. Additional treatment records in September 2021 and October 2021 indicate the Veteran had stable employment at this time, and she had reported working for the same company for approximately five years during the April 2022 PTSD examination. The Veteran was not totally occupationally impaired, even with suicidal ideation noted before the effective date of the 100 percent rating.

Finally, specific to claims for increased disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred, if a claim is received by VA within one year after that date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2). Here, the date of the claim on appeal is August 2, 2023, and the current effective date of the 100 percent rating for PTSD is August 11, 2022, already within the one-year period before the claim on appeal. It was not factually ascertainable that an increase in the Veteran's disability had occurred so as to warrant a 100 percent rating in the one-year period before any application was filed. Rather, it became factually ascertainable that the criteria for a 100 percent rating had been met when the private PTSD examination was received in August 2023. The AOJ then granted an earlier effective date of August 11, 2022, based on finding continuous pursuit where the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c) had not been strictly met. As explained above, even if the Veteran continuously pursued the initial increased rating claim received in March 2021, continuous pursuit does not compel an earlier effective date. The April 2021 and April 2022 VA examinations suggested a much lower level of impairment more consistent with the 50 percent rating assigned before August 11, 2022, which is consistent with the VA treatment records and lay statements of record.

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs persuasively against the claim for an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The benefit-of-doubt doctrine is not for application and entitlement to an effective date before August 11, 2022 for the 100 percent rating for PTSD is not warranted. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

For the purposes of Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35, the child, spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran or service person will have basic eligibility if the Veteran: (1) Was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) Has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) A permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) Died as a result of a service-connected disability; or (if a serviceperson) (5) Is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and (i) Now is, and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by the Secretary concerned as missing in action, captured in line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in line of duty by a foreign Government or power; or (ii) Has been determined by VA to have a total disability permanent in nature incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during active military, naval, or air service; is hospitalized or receiving outpatient medical care, services, or treatment for such disability; is likely to be discharged or released from such service for such disability; and the pursuit of a course of education by such individual's spouse or child for which benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 are sought occurred after December 22, 2006. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a).

2. Entitlement to eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 before August 11, 2022.

The Veteran also seeks an effective date before August 11, 2022, for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

In this case, eligibility for DEA benefits is based on the Veteran receiving the 100 percent evaluation assigned for her PTSD, which is effective August 11, 2022. The effective date of eligibility for DEA benefits is contingent on the effective date of the Veteran's 100 percent evaluation. The Veteran does not meet the other criteria for DEA benefits listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. The 100 percent evaluation is in effect since August 11, 2022; the Veteran's overall disability rating before that date was 50 percent. She does not otherwise meet another criterion for DEA benefits.

Accordingly, the effective date for Dependents' Educational Assistance eligibility may be no earlier than August 11, 2022, the date of the Veteran's permanent total service-connected disability rating. An earlier effective date for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is denied.
