DATE: April 14, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for high blood pressure, to include as secondary to the Veteran's current service-connected temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to the Veteran's current service-connected TMJ, is granted.

Entitlement to a 70 percent increased initial disability evaluation, but no higher, for service-connected generalized anxiety disorder is granted from April 10, 2019, subject to the laws and regulations governing monetary benefits. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 10, 2019, for the 70 percent initial disability rating of the Veteran's service-connected generalized anxiety disorder is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) resulting from a service-connected disability is granted, effective May 29, 2019.

Entitlement to basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is established from May 29, 2019.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In July 2021 a private medical examiner concluded that it is as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected TMJ causes and permanently aggravates his high blood pressure.

2. In July 2021 a private medical examiner concluded that it is as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected TMJ and resulting high blood pressure are contributing factors for the cause and permanent aggravation of the Veteran's headaches.

3. Resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the most probative and persuasive evidence is approximately balanced (nearly equal) in favor of finding that throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's psychiatric disability manifested in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas (such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood) due to severe symptoms including anxiety, suspiciousness, restlessness, inability to concentrate, impaired memory, irritability, chronic sleep impairment, fatigue, and suicidal ideation. 

4. Between the April 19, 2017, withdrawal of the Veteran's initial claim for benefits for a psychiatric disorder, and the April 10, 2019, renewed claim for such benefits, no intervening claims or related filings for VA benefits were submitted.

5. During the entire appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected TMJ and psychiatric disability caused severe physical and mental symptoms that have prevented the Veteran from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment.

6. The Veteran first met the schedular threshold for eligibility for TDIU on April 10, 2019; the Veteran's claim for a TDIU during the appeal period was raised as part and parcel of his May 29, 2020, increased ratings claim; the Veteran's service-connected disabilities worsened during the one-year period preceding his May 29, 2020, increased ratings claim.

7. Given the Board's decision herein granting a TDIU rating, the Veteran's permanent and total disability status is established from May 29, 2019.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria are met for service connection for high blood pressure as secondary to a current service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War Era from May 1973 to October 1974.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits. All initial rating decisions issued after February 19, 2019, are promulgated under the AMA. The rating decision preceding this appeal is a Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision issued in October 2020 following a May 2020 HLR Request in response to a June 2019 rating decision (the rating decision on appeal). Thus, the June 2019 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies.

In his timely July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence docket. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2019 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, then, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

1. Entitlement to service connection for high blood pressure

2. Entitlement to service connection for headaches

Because analysis of these two appealed issues involves application of identical law to congruent facts, the Board will address these issues together.  

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be established for a disability that results from personal injury that is suffered, or disease contracted, in the line of duty, in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to establish service connection for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in service, there must be competent evidence of (1) the current existence of the disability for which service connection is being claimed; (2) incurrence of a disease or injury in active service; and (3) a nexus or connection between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred in service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Id.; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

Finally, certain chronic diseases, including migraine headaches and high blood pressure (hypertension), will be presumed related to service if they (1) were shown as chronic in service; (2) manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or (3) were noted in service, with continuity of symptoms since service that are attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

When the evidence is approximately balanced (nearly equal) for and against a finding regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Factual Background

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for high blood pressure or headaches. His VA treatment records and Social Security Administration (SSA) furnished records evidence that following service he sought medical attention for these conditions since at least 2014 and 2016, respectively. In September 2014, the Veteran reported that he has had "problems" with his blood pressure since he was 30 years old (approximately 10 years post-service). In 2016, the Veteran reported that he has experienced headaches, jaw pain, and facial pain from 1973 to the present. 

The AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has current headache and high blood pressure disabilities. See October 2020 rating decision. 

At the time of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran was service connected for TMJ. He was service connected for generalized anxiety disorder pursuant to that decision, and he subsequently was service connected for tinnitus and carbuncles.  

While the Veteran was not provided a VA examination in connection with either his headache or high blood pressure claims, he did receive VA examinations for his TMJ disability in June 2015 and May 2019, where the Veteran reported experiencing headaches during flare-ups during both assessments.  

Further, the Veteran obtained a private medical evaluation in July 2021. Following a review of the Veteran's claims file, medical records, and consultation with the Veteran, the physician rendered a positive nexus opinion for service connection for both disabilities secondary to the Veteran's service-connected TMJ. "It is as likely as not [the Veteran's] service-connected TMJ disorder causes and permanently aggravates his high blood pressure, and both conditions are contributing factors for the cause and permanent aggravation of his headaches." 

In arriving at this conclusion, the physician considered the Veteran's reporting that when he is suffering from jaw pain due to his TMJ disability, it will usually bring on a headache and also increases his blood pressure. The physician also relied on research showing that the prevalence of hypertension is increased in the chronic pain population, stating, "a recent study shows that chronic pain intensity was a significant predictor of hypertensive status independent of the effects of age, race/ ethnicity, and parental hypertension, suggesting that chronic pain may be associated with increased risk of hypertension." The physician found further support in medical literature that finds teeth grinding or jaw clenching during sleep or throughout the day often aggravates the Trigeminal Nucleus Caudalis, which is a key nerve center that can trigger migraine headaches.

Analysis

The Veteran asserts that his current high blood pressure and headache disabilities were either incurred in service or have been caused or aggravated by his service-connected TMJ disability. This assertion raises several theories of entitlement, to include direct and secondary service connection. Due to the exact disabilities at issue in this case, presumptive service connection is also raised. While noting the various theories of entitlement asserted throughout the appeal period, the Board's analysis will focus on the most cogent of such based on the evidence of record. In light of the fully favorable disposition with respect to this appealed issue, the appellant is not prejudiced by the Board's actions in this regard. Bernard v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 384, 392-94 (1993).

As noted above, the AOJ favorably found that the evidence shows that the Veteran has headache and high blood pressure disabilities. As there is no clear and unmistakable evidence contrary to these favorable findings, the Board is bound by such. Thus, the first element for a service connection claim-under any theory of entitlement-has been met. 

Further, the Veteran is service connected for TMJ, which satisfies the second element for service connection on a secondary basis. The only remaining inquiry, therefore, is whether the Veteran's TMJ disability caused or aggravated his headache and high blood pressure disabilities. 

The claims file is replete with statements from the Veteran, his wife, and his representative describing the circumstances and impact of the Veteran's condition. See e.g., July 2021 Appellate Brief and Veteran statement ("Over the last 3 years as my TMJ disorder has worsened, and so had my head pain. I experienced daily headaches that were severe enough that I had to lie down in a dark room to close my eyes to find relief."). The Board assigns probative weight to the Veteran's competent and credible reporting of the observable symptoms of his TMJ disability-such as pain-including his statements to medical providers, the VA, and his private attorney. 

Turning to the medical evidence, the Board finds that the July 2021 private medical opinion is adequate, complete, and highly probative, as it was based on an interview with the Veteran providing firsthand reporting of his history and symptomatology, a review of his VA file, including statements submitted by the Veteran and his wife describing his symptoms, and a thorough discussion of the physician's rationale supporting his medical conclusions. Further, there is no medical opinion contrary to the positive nexus opinion provided by the July 2021 private physician. As such, the Board finds that medical evidence of a causal nexus between the Veteran's TMJ disability and his headache and high blood pressure disabilities has been shown. Thus, the third and final element to establish service connection on a secondary basis is satisfied.

In view of the above, the Board therefore concludes that the most probative and persuasive evidence of record is favorable to the Veteran's appeal. Based on the foregoing, entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's headache and high blood pressure disabilities, on a secondary basis, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

As a final matter, the Board wishes to underline that these appealed issues are being granted based on the causation prong of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 and Allen without concession of aggravation of the nonservice-connected disabilities by the service-connected disability. As such, the awards downstream from these allowances shall not be subject to a rating offset upon implementation by the AOJ.

3. Entitlement to an increased initial disability evaluation for service-connected generalized anxiety disorder

Legal Criteria

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such disabilities and their residual conditions in civil occupations. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When the evidence is approximately balanced (nearly equal) for and against a finding regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and increase in disability is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). 

The Veteran's generalized anxiety disorder is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400, which directs the rater to apply the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Rating Formula).

Under the General Rating Formula, a 50 percent disability evaluation is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks occurring more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material or forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id. 

A 70 percent disability evaluation is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

The maximum 100 percent disability evaluation is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability of the Veteran to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time and place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

The use of the phrase "such symptoms as," followed by a list of examples, provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating. The use of this terminology permits consideration of items listed and other symptoms and contemplates the effect of those symptoms on the Veteran's social and work situation. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). The symptoms recited in the criteria in the rating schedule for evaluating mental disorders are "not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating." Id. at 442. In adjudicating a claim for a higher rating, the adjudicator must consider all symptoms of a claimant's service-connected mental condition that affect the level of occupational or social impairment. Id. at 443.

Suicidal ideation alone, that is, a veteran's thoughts of his or her own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, and thus may be sufficient to warrant a 70 percent disability rating. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 20 (2017).

Factual Background

The Veteran submitted a claim seeking benefits for numerous disabilities, including service connection for a "mental health condition," on April 10, 2019. Service connection was granted by the AOJ for generalized anxiety disorder in the June 2019 rating decision on appeal and assigned an initial disability evaluation of 30 percent effective April 10, 2019. 

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 (HLR Request) in May 2020, and the AOJ awarded an increased initial disability evaluation of 50 percent effective April 10, 2019, in the October 2020 HLR decision preceding the instant appeal.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim in May 2019. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with generalized anxiety disorder and reported the Veteran's symptoms to include anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, and suicidal ideation. The Veteran told the examiner that when his pain is more severe (6-8) he considers means to end his life. The Veteran also reported experiencing restlessness and irritability. The examiner assessed the functional impact as occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.

Analysis

The Board notes that the Veteran has not endorsed all or nearly all of the symptoms typically associated with a 70 percent evaluation. There was no evidence showing, for example, spatial disorientation or neglect of personal hygiene. Nevertheless, in assigning an evaluation, the Board is not required "to find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms." See Mauerhan, supra. On the other hand, the psychiatric symptoms and resulting functional impairment reported by the Veteran during the appeal period are indicative of serious symptoms resulting in substantial impairment of social and/or occupational functioning. 

Specifically, while the Veteran did not report a plan or intent to act on his suicidal ideation at the time of the May 2019 VA examination, the Court has held that suicidal ideation does not require suicidal intent, a plan, or preparatory behavior and "the presence of suicidal ideation alone, that is, a veteran's thoughts of his or her own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas." See Bankhead, supra. 

Here, there is evidence in support of assigning a rating reflecting a higher severity level than currently assessed and also evidence suggesting milder symptomology. Given this, the Board finds that the most probative evidence is approximately balanced. As such, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board concludes that the functional impairment resulting from the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms most closely approximates the criteria for a 70 percent evaluation throughout the pendency of the appeal period (from April 10, 2019, and continuing thereafter). 

The Board has considered whether a further increased initial evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability is warranted; however, the most probative and persuasive evidence does not support that such criteria are met or are closely approximated during the appeal period for consideration. For instance, symptoms typically associated with a 100 percent evaluation under the General Rating Formula are not demonstrated. For example, there was no evidence of gross impairment in thought processes, or persistent hallucinations or delusions. 

Further, as noted above, a 100 percent schedular evaluation is appropriate when the evidence reflects that a service-connected psychiatric disability results in total social and occupational impairment. While the Veteran unquestionably has experienced occupational impairment (discussed in greater detail below), he has repeatedly represented that this was in large part due to physical pain occasioned by his other disabilities. Neither the Veteran nor his private attorney have asserted that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability, acting alone, resulted in total occupational impairment.

Accordingly, an increased initial disability evaluation of 70 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected generalized anxiety disorder is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9400.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 10, 2019, for service-connected generalized anxiety disorder

Legal Criteria

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the claim is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date will be the date following separation from service, or the date entitlement arose (whichever is later). 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). In the context of a claim for service connection, the date of entitlement hinges on when the service-connected disability first manifested itself under all facts found. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Factual Background

The Veteran first filed a VA Form 21-526EZ claim for service connection for "mental conditions" on April 4, 2017, which was withdrawn through a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim received on April 19, 2017. In response, on April 21, 2017, VA sent the Veteran a claim withdrawal letter confirming the action and notifying the Veteran that he had 30 days from the date of the letter to reinstate his claim. No response was received.

On April 10, 2019, the Veteran filed another VA Form 21-526EZ, renewing his benefits claim for a "mental health condition" and has continuously pursued his claim since that time. The Veteran's file contains no claim or preparatory filing for any psychiatric condition or disability between submission of the April 2017 VA Form 21-526EZ and the April 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Analysis 

Under the circumstances, the Board can find no basis for awarding an earlier effective date, as the Veteran failed to continuously pursue his April 2017 claim following the expiration of the 30-day deadline communicated by VA to reinstate that claim in response to the Veteran's claim withdrawal correspondence.

Consequently, because there is no basis for assigning an earlier date of claim, April 10, 2019, is the earliest possible effective date under the governing law for the Veteran's service-connected generalized anxiety disorder. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

5. Entitlement to TDIU

Legal Criteria

TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment because of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id.

The criteria for whether a veteran is unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment includes both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to obtain and maintain such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id.

An award of TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the veteran can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Because a claim for TDIU is essentially a claim for an increased disability rating, effective date regulations for TDIU claims include the one-year "look-back" period. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

Factual Background

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 (Application for Increased Compensation Based Upon Unemployability) seeking TDIU on July 28, 2021. Therein, he reports that he last worked full-time on October 31, 2012, which is the date he became too disabled to work due to his service-connected disabilities. 

Following service, the Veteran obtained a bachelor's degree and became an electrical engineer. He was out of the workforce for 12-15 years to care for his wife after she was paralyzed in a skiing accident in 1993 but returned to his career from February 2008 to October 2012. See May 2019 VA examination; July 2021 VA Form 21-8940. 

In the June 2015 VA examination report for the Veteran's TMJ condition, the examiner opined that this disability would impact his ability to work due to his symptoms. The examiner reported that the Veteran's TMJ causes pain, and when he has difficulty popping his jaw to help relieve the pain, the Veteran experiences panic, frustration, and distraction. The pain also causes loss of sleep leading to daytime fatigue. All of these symptoms, the examiner concluded, lead to difficulty performing the duties of the Veteran's job. 

The Veteran has described how his service-connected disabilities impaired and ultimately precluded his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment. "I worked for the engineering firms listed here with chronic pain as best as I could. Much of the time away from work during these years was suffering with pain and resting so I could continue to work not able to give 100% effort because the pain interfered with my ability to concentrate. As an electrical/ electronics engineer my duties required electronic circuit design/invention, complex mathematical analysis, problem solving, troubleshooting, interaction with co-workers, design review meetings, and presentations to customers of these firms. My ability to concentrate enough to fully perform my work duties continued to decrease, as the pain increased. I became less and less able to perform my duties for these firms. At the last company [] I worked 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. I did at first, but towards the middle of 2012, I started just being present at work, but doing very little work because of the pain. Then I started missing work and used up my vacation and sick leave. I requested that I be allowed to take time off without pay. I became a poor employee because the pain increased until I was either not working while at work or missing too much work...I lost my engineering job and career because of my inability to concentrate due to pain." See SSA Records.

During his July 2021 private medical evaluation, the physician assessed the impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to work. After reviewing the claims file and interviewing the Veteran, the physician opined that the Veteran would need to miss work or leave early three or more days per month due to the pain and limitations from his mental health symptoms and TMJ pain particularly, would need more than one additional break per day outside of normally scheduled breaks to relieve his symptoms, and for more than three days per month the Veteran would be unable to focus for at least seven hours out of an eight-hour day due to mental health symptoms, pain, extra breaks required, and medication side effects.

The physician concluded that "when his mental and physical limitations, side effects of medications, as well as his past relevant work and educational background are factored in, [the Veteran] is unable to maintain substantial gainful employment as a result of his service-connected [TMJ] disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. This has been the case since at least the date of claim, April 10, 2019." The physician noted that his opinion was based on the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone and did not include non-service-connected impairments.

Analysis

Given the Board's decision herein granting an increased initial rating of 70 percent for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability, the Veteran has met the schedular threshold requirements for TDIU under either prong of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) since the April 10, 2019, effective date for service connection for generalized anxiety disorder. Thus, the Veteran is eligible for TDIU based on his service-connected disabilities from that date. Therefore, the Board need only consider whether his service-connected disabilities render him unemployable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

The Board finds that the most probative and persuasive evidence of record reflects that for the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has been unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities-specifically, his TMJ and generalized anxiety disorder. There is no information contrary to this finding in the medical records, SSA records, or lay testimony.

The claims file indicates that the Veteran's symptoms limit both his mental and physical abilities in an occupational environment, such as anxiety, suspiciousness, restlessness, inability to concentrate, impaired memory, irritability, chronic sleep impairment, fatigue, and suicidal ideation. Thus, the Veteran is incapable of performing either the physical or mental acts required by employment consistent with his background and education in any type of setting that would result in anything more than marginally gainful employment. 

In his July 28, 2021, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran notes that the submission is not a new claim for [TDIU] benefits, but rather is part of the Veteran's increased rating claim on appeal. As previously discussed, the instant appeal encompasses an increased rating claim for the Veteran's psychiatric disability, which has been continuously pursued since his April 10, 2019, claim for service connection. When service-connection was granted for the Veteran's generalized anxiety disorder in June 2019, the Veteran appealed the initial rating evaluation in a May 29, 2020, VA Form 20-0996. A HLR decision was issued in October 2020 and the instant appeal and VA Form 21-8940 followed on July 28, 2021. Thus, the Veteran's TDIU claim was raised as part and parcel of the increased ratings claim within the VA Form 20-0996 submitted on May 29, 2020. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 452. 

While the Board observes that the April 10, 2019, claim included an increased rating claim for the Veteran's TMJ, this issue was adjudicated in the June 2019 rating decision on appeal. The Veteran did not appeal this issue pursuant to the June 2019 rating decision, and no new and relevant evidence was received during the subsequent year; thus, the rating decision became final as to the increased rating claim for TMJ.

The Board notes that as the Veteran filed his VA Form 20-0996 on May 29, 2020, the period on appeal begins on May 29, 2019 (that is, calculating from the date VA received the claim, plus the one-year "look-back period" for evidence of worsening of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982.

The Board finds that evidence in the record indicates that during the one-year "look back period" preceding his VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran experienced a worsening of his disabilities. For example, in June 2019 the Veteran's disability evaluation for TMJ was increased from 10 percent to 20 percent. Further, the Veteran submitted an increased rating claim in May 2020 for both TMJ and generalized anxiety disorder. Affording the Veteran the benefit of doubt, the Board finds it is reasonable to assume the Veteran's disabilities worsened prior to the date VA received his claim for increased ratings, as he at least as likely as not had been living with worsening symptoms before the date of his claim for higher rating evaluations.

The Board further finds that the evidence of record indicates that during the one-year "look-back" period preceding his claim, the Veteran was unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due to the severity of his service-connected disabilities, and that he met the schedular threshold for TDIU.

Consequently, and under the liberal application of Gaston, the Board finds TDIU is warranted beginning May 29, 2019. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16, 4.19; see Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

6. Entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status

Basic eligibility to DEA (Chapter 35 benefits) exists if a veteran has a permanent, total service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501. A total disability may be assigned where the veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341. Permanence of total disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b). 

For the reasons discussed above, the Veteran has been unemployable due to his service-connected disabilities since at least May 29, 2019, the effective date awarded herein for his TDIU rating.

Therefore, the Veteran is eligible for DEA benefits effective May 29, 2019. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 5110; 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 3.807.
