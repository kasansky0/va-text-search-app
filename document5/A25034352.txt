ORDER

Prior to December 24, 2013, entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for coronary artery disease (CAD) is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to December 24, 2013, the Veteran's CAD resulted in cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, confirmed by echocardiogram. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Prior to December 24, 2013, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for CAD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1969 to December 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In December 2024, the Veteran timely filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. See December 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

In January 2025, a Docket Switch Waiver Letter was prepared and sent to the Veteran. No response was received from the Veteran and more than 60 days have elapsed since the Board received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 and more than a year has elapsed since the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal. Therefore, the Board will proceed with a decision on this case. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the current level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1995). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may also be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Entitlement to an increased rating for CAD prior to December 24, 2013.

The Veteran contends his service-connected CAD is more disabling than the 10 percent rating currently in effect prior to December 24, 2013. See December 2023 VA Form 20-0996; see also December 2024 VA Form 10182. In this instance, the Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent evaluation for CAD from August 31, 2010, to December 23, 2013, under DC 7005, for arteriosclerotic heart disease (CAD). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

The Veteran has continuously pursued the claim at issue since the January 2023 rating decision, which implemented the Board grant of service connection for CAD. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), 3.2500(h). Thus, the relevant review period on appeal begins August 31, 2010, the date of service connection. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the schedular criteria for evaluation of a cardiovascular disability were amended during the course of this appeal. Specifically, the criteria pertaining to CAD under DC 7005 were amended effective November 14, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 54089 (September 30, 2021).

Where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim for an increased disability rating, the Board must first determine whether application of the revised version would produce retroactive results, as a new rule may not extinguish any rights or benefits the claimant had prior to the enactment of the new rule. VAOPGCPREC 07-03 (November 19, 2003).

However, if the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change. If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308, 313 (1991), overruled in part, Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). 

Given that the Veteran's claim was received prior to the effective date of the regulation changes, the Board must consider the ratings for the Veteran's CAD under both the pre-amendment and revised rating criteria and must apply the pre-amendment rating criteria if that result would be more favorable to the Veteran. Id.

Prior to November 14, 2021, a 10 percent rating for arteriosclerotic heart disease (CAD) under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005, is warranted where a workload of greater than 7.0 metabolic equivalents (METs) but not greater than 10.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or continuous medication is required. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 5.0 METs but not greater than 7.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray.

A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or a workload of greater than 3.0 METs but not greater than 5.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent. For the purposes of a 60 percent evaluation, the pre-amendment rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent. Otero-Castro v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 375, 382 (2002). 

A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic congestive heart failure, or a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. For the purposes of a 100 percent evaluation, the pre-amendment rating criteria do not require a separate showing of left ventricular dysfunction in addition to an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. Id. 

Pursuant to the pre-amendment criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104 Note (2). When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used. Id. 

Under the amended rating criteria, effective November 14, 2021, arteriosclerotic heart disease (CAD) is rated in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart (General Formula). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005. A 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication is required for control.

A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging).

A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms.

A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

For the purposes of the General Formula, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3). 

Pursuant to the post-amendment criteria, one MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, a medical examiner may estimate the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2).

Here, the amended criteria provide less criteria under which the Veteran can receive an increased rating. Therefore, the pre-amendment criteria are most favorable to the Veteran's claim and will be applied in this instance. 

The Board notes it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes January 2011 to January 2014 VAMC records and September 2010 to January 2014 private treatment records. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. 

Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim. See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). As detailed below, the Board finds the record supports an increased rating to 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's CAD prior to December 24, 2013. 

The Veteran underwent an electrocardiogram in September 2010, that identified a possible left atrial abnormality. On an echocardiogram performed the same date, the Veteran's estimated ejection fraction at rest was found to be 50 to 60 percent, with improvement of 60 to 70 percent with exercise. 

A subsequent electrocardiogram was performed in November 2012, with abnormal results noting a possible left atrial abnormality. On an echocardiogram performed the same date, the Veteran's estimated ejection fraction at rest was found to be 50 to 55 percent, with improvement of 60 to 65 percent with exercise. 

In December 2013, the Veteran was hospitalized for a myocardial infarction. An echocardiogram conducted at that time revealed moderate dilatation of the right ventricle with decreased function and mild left ventricle hypertrophy. The Veteran's ejection fraction was found to be 55 percent. The Veteran's treating cardiologist opined the Veteran has a "long history of Agent Orange exposure producing...cardiomyopathy. [The Veteran] stated that in the past he has had 3 MIs in 1989...." 

At this juncture, the Board finds that, prior to December 24, 2013, the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether a 30 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's CAD. As noted above, the pre-amendment criteria support a 30 percent evaluation where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005. 

Here, while cardiac testing performed in December 2013 revealed cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, the Veteran's cardiologist clearly indicated the Veteran had a long history of cardiomyopathy prior to that date. Cardiac testing dating back to September 2010 also identified a left atrial abnormality, which was confirmed by subsequent testing in November 2012. 

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation pre-dated his December 2013 myocardial infarction. Therefore, after resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the claim, the Board finds that a 30 percent rating for the Veteran's CAD is warranted based on the findings of the electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, as well as the December 2013 opinion of his treating cardiologist. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board has also considered whether a rating in excess of 30 percent is warranted. However, neither the Veteran's VA nor private treatment records contain a diagnosis or treatment for congestive heart failure, or METs testing prior to December 24, 2013. In addition, the Veteran's ejection fraction results from September 2010 to December 2013 range from 50 to 60 percent at rest, and 60 to 70 percent with exercise. As such, the Veteran's CAD did not rise to the requisite level of severity prior to December 24, 2013, to support either a 60 or 100 percent rating.

In conclusion, the Board finds the relevant evidence of record supports a disability evaluation of 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's CAD under the pre-amendment criteria of DC 7005, prior to December 24, 2013. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a higher evaluation, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
