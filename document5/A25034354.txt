REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from January 1986 to January 1989. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In May 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for insomnia, IBS, bilateral hip condition with pain, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, and bilateral shoulder condition with pain most recently addressed in a February 2024 rating decision. In September 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on March 11, 2025. 

However, during the Veteran's Board hearing, his representative expressly requested to waive the 90 day evidence submission window following the hearing due to the Veteran's serious health condition. The Board notes that the Veteran's claims are Advanced on the Docket due to the Veteran's serious health condition and expediency is the Veteran's reason for requesting to waive the 90 day evidence window. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran waived the 90 day evidence window during the March 11, 2025, Board hearing and the Board has proceeded with adjudicating the Veteran's claims. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.302, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For all veterans, if there is no underlying diagnosis, a current disability may be established based on pain or other symptoms that result in functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020); Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).

Each claimed disabling condition must be considered on the basis of the places, types and circumstances of the veteran's service as shown by service records and lay evidence. Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of all evidence of record, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for a disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Similarly, all relevant lay and medical evidence should be considered concerning the inception or incurrence, symptoms or manifestations, and course or development of the injury or disease for direct service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304.

In adjudicating such claims, reasonable doubt that exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence concerning any point will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. through 8. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome with rectal bleeding (IBS), a left hip condition with pain, a right hip condition with pain, right lower extremity radiculopathy, left lower extremity radiculopathy, a left shoulder condition with pain, and a right shoulder condition with pain.

The Veteran contends that all claimed conditions had their onset during active military service or are related to parachuting and other intense physical activities during active military service. Specifically, the Veteran described his regular military duties including completing 15 or more parachute jumps during service that included night jumps, hard landings, bouncing down through pine trees, and at least one occasion where his chute did not open. He asserts that his conditions are due to the shock of landing, especially the hard landings, which have caused long term wear and tear on his body. The Veteran also asserts that his conditions resulted from other physically intense activities during service, including as an airborne infantry soldier, from marching, carrying heavy equipment during physical training activities (80-100 pounds of equipment), and lifting heavy equipment. See, e.g., VBMS document titled, "VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim," receipt date 09/19/2023; VBMS document titled, "VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim," receipt date 05/21/2024.

The relevant evidence associated with the claims file includes service treatment records (STRs), military personnel records (MPRs), private treatment records, private medical opinion, VA examinations an opinions (with exception of claim for insomnia), lay statements, medical journal articles regarding parachute jumps and associated injuries, and hearing testimony. The notations in private treatment records and opinion, and the Veteran's MPRs and STRs generally corroborate the statements and testimony by the Veteran and his wife for his claims, including indications of pain and injuries from physical training and parachuting as well as in-service onset of symptoms related to all claims.

In the February 2024 and September 2024 rating decisions, the AOJ made favorable findings related to claims of IBS (STRs show onset during service); bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy (current diagnoses), bilateral hip condition with pain (current diagnoses). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran's MPRs show that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was an infantry soldier (11B1P, 11H1P, and 11H1O), he earned his parachutist badge, and was assigned to airborne infantry regiments throughout his active duty service. The Veteran's entrance examination shows no complaints of symptoms or diagnoses related to any claimed conditions. The Veteran's STRs reveal that he reported onset of IBS symptoms shortly after entering service and that his symptoms continued through service to include an April 1988 record that the Veteran had experienced rectal bleeding and diarrhea for two years, the record references "normal" findings on a prior proctoscopy, no diagnosis was rendered, and recommended treatment was Metamucil fiber supplement. There are no in-service complaints for sleep, shoulder, back, nerve, or hip conditions. Then, at separation, the Veteran reported a history of "piles or rectal disease," on his separation report of medical history but no findings upon examination were noted and no other symptoms or diagnoses were reported or noted as to any other claimed conditions.  See VBMS document titled, "Military Personnel Record," receipt date 12/19/2023 pages 8, 13, 17, 28, 32, 36, 42, 51, 52, 55, 56, 58, 83, 93, 94, 95, 100 of 123 (includes MPRs and STRs). 

During the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran specifically testified that his separation examination was less than five minutes, and the military examiner did not perform any physical examination. See VBMS document titled, "Hearing Transcript," receipt date 03/11/2025.

All VA examinations were performed by the same contract examiner on the same date in June 2024. All relevant evidence of record, except the hearing testimony, was associated with the Veteran's file prior to the June 2024 examinations. All examination reports include identical evidence comments which refer to the Veteran's lay statement, relevant STRs, the Veteran's DD-214, a March 7, 1994, CT scan of the lumbar spine, a March 16, 2019, barium enema with no significant abnormality seen, copies the AOJ findings from the February 2024 rating decision, a September 25, 2017, private podiatric examination, and a January 2018 chiropractic examination with hip adduction test finding "pelvic unleveling" and left and right side pelvic pain (sacroiliac). The examination reports and opinions are silent for reference or incorporation of any other evidence, including medical records, MPRs, STRs, or lay statements. See, e.g., VBMS documents titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 06/14/2024.

The VA examination reports all include the Veteran's report and descriptions of symptom onset during active duty service, and which are consistent with the Veteran's lay statement, his wife's lay statement, and their hearing testimony. None of the VA examination reports or opinions refer to or incorporate the medical literature, the Wife's lay statement, or the private provider's opinions as to the claimed conditions. In addition, all VA examination reports include at least some findings that conflict with the private medical records, STRs, and the lay reports of onset, continuation, and current symptoms of each claimed condition yet none of the examination reports or opinions provide any explanation for the conflicting findings. The examination reports include conflicting findings between them as well; for example, the peripheral nerve examination revealed bilateral hip pain on flexion, however the hip examination revealed no left hip pain at any movement including flexion. Id. 

The VA opinions were based on the lack of a current diagnosis for each condition with the exception of the right hip, which the examiner indicated was not related to service and referred to a 2016 hip dislocation. The VA opinions did not incorporate, refer to, or explain examination findings that conflict with the medical literature, the Veteran's statements, or the Veteran's medical records. Other than the opinion for the right hip, which the examiner opined was due to a 2016 hip dislocation, the VA examiner rendered an identical, one sentence rationale for all examined conditions, "there is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis." Id.

The Veteran submitted private treatment records from his primary care provider of 35 years, Dr. G.C. The majority of the records are dated from 2019 to 2024, however, the submission included a few older records. In February 1989, one month following separation from active service, the Veteran was seen by Dr. G.C. for the complaint of blood in his stool that had been ongoing for approximately 3 years while he was in the military, and for which he saw military doctors. The Veteran reported that one military doctor said "he might have had a polyp but didn't do anything. The second doctor said he could see where the first doctor said he might have had a polyp but still didn't do anything. He still had blood in his stools." Dr. G.C. scheduled a colonoscopy and barium enema; however, a March 1989 follow-up note reveals normal results from the colonoscopy and barium enema but also "no evidence of any polyp whatsoever." Dr. G.C. asked the Veteran to let him know if there was any further rectal bleeding and would decide how next to proceed at that time. A March 2000 emergency department record is largely illegible but includes a notation of "no stool, no blood." 

Dr. G.C.'s records between March 2019 and January 2024 include minimal data regarding the purpose of a particular visit and did not include complete lists of active problems but only for problems with continuous prescription medication treatment. For example, a September 2022 visit notes diagnosis of hyperlipidemia however subsequent visits do not include any history of hyperlipidemia or the prescribing information. The Veteran also has asthma which appears for diagnosis but disappears from subsequent records in similar fashion. The Board also notes that an October 2019 diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is not indicated or referenced in follow-up visit records. There is no indication that the Veteran's hyperlipidemia, asthma, or GERD resolved. Dr. G.C.'s available medical treatment records do not reveal any diagnosis, complaints, or treatment for any of the claimed conditions. See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 04/11/2024, pages 17, 20, 29, 31, 35, 48, 53, 54, 55 of 76.

The Veteran submitted an October 2015 urgent care record showing report of intermittent right hip pain that "comes and goes." The private provider diagnosed the Veteran with sciatica, right side, and somatic dysfunction related to low back pain. See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 10/12/2023, 4 pages.

The Veteran also submitted a January 2018 record from his private chiropractor who noted "pelvic unleveling," and bilateral hip pain during a hip adduction test. See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 11/06/2023, 3 pages.  

The Veteran submitted a May 2024 Medical Questionnaire, completed by Dr. G.C. where Dr. G.C. confirmed that the Veteran has been his patient for 35 years, he has current chronic disabilities including bilateral shoulder pain and IBS. In addition, Dr. G.C. confirmed that throughout the entire 35 years that he has been treating the Veteran, that the Veteran has had "persistent and continuous symptomology" related to bilateral shoulder pain, IBS, insomnia, bilateral hip pain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, among other conditions to include the Veteran's service-connected back and achilles tendon disabilities. Dr. G.C. confirmed that it is his professional opinion that the Veteran's parachute duties during active military service significantly contributed to his current orthopedic issues, specifically including bilateral shoulder pain, bilateral hip pain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. Dr. G.C. indicated that he reviewed the submitted medical literature and agrees that repeated trauma from the impact of parachute jumps was a significant risk factor for the Veteran's orthopedic injuries, specifically including bilateral shoulder pain, bilateral hip pain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. Finally, Dr. G.C. confirmed that it is his opinion that after reviewing all medical literature, and based on personal knowledge and professional knowledge of the Veteran's conditions over the duration of treatment, it is as likely as not that the Veteran's conditions including IBS, insomnia, bilateral shoulder pain, bilateral hip pain, and bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy are due to event and injuries that occurred during his active-duty service. See VBMS document titled, "Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility," receipt date 05/21/2024.

To support his claims, the Veteran has submitted detailed statements by him and his wife that he had pain and other symptoms of all claimed conditions during service which have continued and progressed since that time; including symptoms of IBS and insomnia, bilateral shoulder pain, bilateral hip pain, and bilateral lower extremity numbness and weakness. See, e.g., VBMS document titled, "VA form 21-10210 - Lay Witness Statement," receipt date 05/20/2024; VBMS document titled, "VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim," receipt date 05/21/2024. 

In the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran and his wife competently testified as to the in-service onset, continuous, and persistent symptoms of all claimed conditions and to the Veteran's regular and longterm medical care under Dr. G.C. The competent testimonies of the Veteran and his wife are consistent with their lay statements and the medical questionnaire and opinion of Dr. G.C. See VBMS document titled, "Hearing Transcript," receipt date 03/11/2025.

Although the Veteran did not seek treatment for all conditions during service, or he did not have ongoing treatment after initially seeking treatment, he is still competent to report symptom onset and ongoing noticeable symptoms, as he did in his June 2024 VA examinations. His wife his also competent to report noticing ongoing symptoms. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994). There is no reason to find these competent lay statements, testimonies, and reports to medical examiners not credible, particularly given that there is no probative evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, the Board finds that the competent lay statements, reports, and testimony of the Veteran and his wife are also credible. 

The Board finds that the VA examination reports all include conflicting findings without explanation and that the VA opinions, which are based on the findings of those VA examinations, are conclusory, fail to incorporate the relevant lay statements, Veteran's reports of symptom onset and continuation, relevant medical records, and medical literature submitted by the Veteran. Moreover, despite the Veteran's competent and credible reports of pain causing functional impairment, as noted in the VA examination reports, the VA examiner failed to opine or explain the lack of diagnosis based on functional impairment due to pain. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Accordingly, the Board finds that the VA examinations and opinions are inadequate because they lack sufficient explanations, are based on incomplete medical history, and failed to explain both internal inconsistencies as well as findings inconsistent with the other evidence of record. 

The Board may reject a medical opinion that is conclusory and lacks supporting analysis. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124-25 (2007) (a mere conclusion by an examiner is insufficient to allow the Board to make a fully informed decision as to the probative value of the opinion). See also D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008) (holding that a medical opinion must be based on the veteran's prior medical history). The Board finds that all VA examinations and opinions are all internally inconsistent and/or inconsistent with the Veteran's medical history and the credible evidence of record. As such, the VA examinations are conclusory and therefore inadequate and entitled to no probative weight.

In contrast, the Board finds that although the medical records obtained from Dr. G.C. are incomplete, as the Veteran's primary care provider since February 1989, one month after separation from service, Dr. G.C. is in the best position to opine on the Veteran's medical history since separation from service through current medical diagnoses and etiology because he has personal knowledge of the Veteran's prior medical history, symptomology, and current diagnoses. Therefore, the Board assigns great probative weight to the May 2024 medical questionnaire and opinion of Dr. G.C., the Veteran's longterm primary care provider.

Accordingly, the evidence is at least in relative equipoise for all elements of service connection, and reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor. Service connection is warranted for all claimed conditions based on the competent and credible medical nexus opinion of the Veteran's longterm primary care provider. The appeals as to entitlement to direct service connection are granted in full.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
