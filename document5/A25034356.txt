REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

In June 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant, representing the relevant dental practice, and electing the Direct Review docket to review October 2020 Explanation of Benefits decisions issued by VA. The Explanation of Benefits documents addressed three different dates of service in December 2019, but they will be addressed together as virtually the same procedural facts apply to each instance of dental treatment.    

The claims for payment for dental services provided to the Veteran on December 4, 26, and 30, 2019, were then administratively approved in June 2021, while this appeal was pending.  

The December 4 claim was paid in the amount of $975.78 for billed charges totaling $976.00. The December 26 claim was paid in the amount of $479.82 for billed charges totaling $480.00. The December 30 claim was paid in the full billed amount of $1,053.00. Explanations of Payment, June 2021. 

The administrative actions approving payment for each relevant episode of care constitutes a reversal of the October 2020 denials and full grants of the benefits sought in this appeal. On that basis, no determination remains with which the appellant disagrees and the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d).
