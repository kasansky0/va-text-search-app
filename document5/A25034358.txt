ORDER

Entitlement to higher disability ratings for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), rated 30 percent prior to June 15, 2022, and 70 percent, thereafter, are DENIED.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of the 70 percent disability rating for PTSD is DENIED.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is DENIED.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is DENIED.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From to December 6, 2018 to June 14, 2022, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not more closely approximate difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

2. From June 15, 2022, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

3. On December 6, 2018, the Veteran filed an intent to file; within one year, in March 2019, she submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) seeking service connection for PTSD.

4. The date entitlement arose for a higher disability rating for PTSD was on June 15, 2022.

5. Prior to June 15, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not render her unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. 

6. From June 15, 2022, the Veteran has been awarded a TDIU and is considered permanent and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for higher disability ratings for PTSD, rated 30 percent prior to June 15, 2022, and 70 percent, thereafter, have not been met.   38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of the 70 percent disability rating for PTSD have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities have not been met.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16. 

4.  The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 15, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 USC chapter 35 have not been met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1991 to May 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

I

Legal Criteria - Increased Rating

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication, or to interfere with occupational and social functioning.

A 10 percent rating is assigned when mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of occasional stress, or symptoms controlled by medication cause occupational and social impairment.

A 30 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, or mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events), cause occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation).

A 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

Analysis - PTSD

The Veteran requests a higher disability rating for service-connected PTSD, currently rated 30 percent prior to June 15, 2022, and 70 percent thereafter. 

The Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued an increased rating claim for PTSD since the December 6, 2018 date of intent to file. Within one year, in March 2019, she submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) seeking service connection for PTSD.  In an August 2019 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective December 6, 2018.  

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting a higher rating for PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU.  In a rating decision, dated the same month, the RO continued the 30 percent rating assigned for PTSD.  The Veteran filed another VA Form 20-005 Supplemental Claim Application, in August 2020 and August 2021, requesting a higher rating for PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU.  

In a July 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 70 percent to 30 percent, effective June 15, 2022.  

In September 2022, she filed a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, which the RO interpreted as an application for an increased rating for PTSD.  In a January 2023 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to a TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA, both effective June 15, 2022; and denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. 

In a January 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, the Veteran requested a higher rating for PTSD and earlier effective dates for PTSD, TDIU, and DEA claims.  In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO denied the increased rating and earlier effective date claims.  The Veteran filed an April 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD perfecting the appeal before the Board. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has demonstrated continuous pursuit of the instant appeal. Given the nature of the present claim for a higher initial evaluation, the Board has considered all evidence of severity since December 6, 2018, the effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

From December 6, 2018 to June 14, 2022, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's associated PTSD symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent or higher.

During this period, the Board concludes that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 50 percent or higher. The Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 30 percent rating. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in July 2019, during which the examiner found occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  

She reported positive family and social relationships, including the ability to make and maintain these relationships.  She is married, has three to four close girlfriends, engages in social activities such as lunch and aerobics, and spends up to four days a week with her grandson.  

For mental health history, she reported medication and counseling treatment. The following symptoms were marked: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, and chronic sleep impairment. 

On behavioral observation, the Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres, casually dressed, and adequately groomed.  She made appropriate eye contact with a calm mood and congruent affect.  Her speech was logical, intact and goal directed.  She initiated spontaneous conversation with normal thought process, no hallucinations, no delusional thoughts, and denied homicidal and suicidal ideation.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was polite, cooperative, and put forth strong effort during the evaluation. 

Under PTSD diagnostic criteria, the examiner marked that the Veteran has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories and dreams with avoidance, peristent negative emotional state, and markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities with hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disturbance.

VA medical records indicate that the Veteran enrolled in a behavioral health interdisciplinary program (BHIP) in February 2020.  During the mental health consultation, she presented with anxiety and depression.  She reported feelings of sadness and stress due to the recent passing of a family member and pet.  She reported a history trauma in the 1990's causing delusion and 11 hospitalizations until she was treated with medication and started working as a nurse.  She reported that her current symptoms have been managed by medication, and aside from stress, she has been functioning and engaged in social activities.  

On mental status examination, she was oriented in all spheres, appeared adequately groomed and dressed appropriately with normal eye contact.  Her mood was neutral with full range of affect and clear speech.  Attention was focused with normal psychomotor, intact memory, coherent and logical thought process, realistic thought content, intact judgment, and cooperative rapport.  Diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders were provided, but the PTSD screen was negative. 

In an August 2020 letter, the Veteran's representative argued that a 70 percent rating for PTSD is warranted based on the July 2019 VA examiner's PTSD diagnostic criteria findings. At the May 2023 Higher Level Review Informal Conference, the Veteran by and through her representative requested a 70 percent rating from the December 6, 2018 date of intent to file based on continuous symptoms citing private medical records.

The claims file contains private treatment, specifically medication management, for PTSD symptoms. In February 2019 and May 2019 visits, the Veteran reported persistent symptoms of low self-esteem, worrisome, sadness, restlessness, and depression.  She denied suicidal and homicidal ideations.  In December 2020, at a medication management follow-up, she reported medication compliance and denied side effects. The clinician noted that symptoms were stable.  

March 2021 private medical records document complaints of anxiety and medication management. The clinician noted an increase in anxiety with a decrease in medication dosage but continued use of the medication and that the Veteran was sleeping well at night.

From December 6, 2018 to June 14, 2022, VA and private treatment records, the July 2019 VA examination, and the Veteran's statements show that her PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating (depressed mood, anxiety, weekly panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment).

The Veteran also had symptoms that are not listed with a specific rating, such as low self-esteem, worrying, avoidance, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and restlessness. The Board finds the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's unlisted symptoms more closely approximate the symptoms contemplated by a 30 percent rating, which are less severe, less frequent, and shorter in duration than those contemplated by a 50 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.  Further, these symptoms are similar to depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, and chronic sleep impairment which are contemplated by the assigned 30 percent rating.

The Board also finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 30 percent rating.  The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, but was generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and normal conversation.  

The Board recognizes a history of delusions and hospitalizations in the 1990s, however, this is outside of the applicable appeal period.  From December 6, 2018 to June 14, 2022, mental status examinations and behavioral observations have been relatively normal.  The Veteran herself has reported symptom control with medication treatment and positive family and social relationships. 

While the Veteran did experience symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating-disturbances of motivation and mood-the evidence overall does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a 50 percent rating.  February 2020 VA treatment records attributed feelings of sadness and stress to the recent passing of a family member and pet.  A discrete and isolated incident.  And as discussed above, the Veteran's other remaining symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a 30 percent rating.  Further, treatment records contain reports that the Veteran was generally performing well with positive social relationships.  In fact, during the July 2019 VA examination, she reported positive family relationships and friendships, including going out to lunch with friends and spending time with a grandson weekly.

From December 6, 2018 to June 14, 2022, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a 50 percent rating.  And, so, the Board concludes, that during this period, the criteria for a 50 percent or higher rating are not met.

From June 15, 2022, the issue before the Board is whether the Veteran's associated PTSD symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms did not cause the level of impairment required for a disability rating of 100 percent.  The Veteran's symptoms more closely approximated the symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating, and resulted in a level of impairment that most closely approximated the level of impairment associated with a 70 percent rating. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA PTSD examination in June 2022.  The examiner found occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  On examination, she reported depression due to recent life events and that she no longer participates in pool aerobics. 

The following symptoms were marked: depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks more than once a week, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, and disturbances of motivation and mood. On behavior observation, the Veteran was alert and oriented with a flat affect.  She was appropriately groomed, cooperative, responsive, and engaged. In the remarks section, the examiner described the Veteran's sleep disturbances attributed to PTSD.

The Veteran participated in another VA PTSD examination in October 2022, during which an examiner found occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. The Veteran reported marital difficulties, an increase in panic attacks, isolation, and detachment from her children. She denied participation in hobbies, including pool aerobics because the pool is closed for renovations.  She reported having one friend she socializes with but that her friendship is impacted by symptoms. She denied self-harm but reported that she believes she needs to be hospitalized because her life is "going downhill" and that she needs a person to talk to on a regular basis. The examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms have worsened since the June 2022 examination as she is reporting an increase in anxiety, panic attacks, and difficulty with self-care.  

The following symptoms were marked: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks more than once a week, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently appropriately and effectively, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, inability to establish and maintain effective relationships, suicidal ideation, impaired impulse control, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living. 

On behavioral observation, the Veteran was well groomed and casually dressed.  She presented with a depressed mood and congruent affect.  Speech was appropriate with clear and logical thought process.  She reported paranoid thoughts and suicidal ideations but denied plans or intent.  Her judgment was within normal limits, but short-term memory was mildly impaired.  The Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres. 

VA treatment records, the June 2022 and October 2022 VA examinations, and the Veteran's lay statements show that the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating (suicidal ideation, near-continuous panic or depression, neglect of personal appearance and hygiene, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships), and symptoms associated with a 100 percent rating (intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living).  

The Veteran expressed suicidal ideation, which is contemplated by the 70 percent rating and can implicate persistent danger of self-harm, which is contemplated by the 100 percent criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 19 (2017).  The severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's suicidal ideation, in the Board's view, has not risen to the level contemplated by the 100 percent disability rating.  The Veteran regularly denied thoughts, intent, or a plan involving self-harm during June 2022 and October 2022 VA PTSD examinations.

The Board finds the level of impairment caused by the Veteran's symptoms more closely approximates the level associated with a 70 percent rating.  The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity with deficiencies in most areas.  Behavioral observations during VA examinations indicate that the Veteran was alert and oriented in all spheres.  During the most recent October 2022 examination, the Veteran was well groomed and casually dressed.  She presented with a depressed mood and congruent affect.  Speech was appropriate with clear and logical thought process.  She reported paranoid thoughts and suicidal ideations but denied plans or intent.  Her judgment was within normal limits, but short-term memory was mildly impaired.  

While the Veteran did experience symptoms contemplated by a 100 percent rating- intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living -the evidence overall does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a 100 percent rating.  During both VA examinations she was observed as appropriately dressed and adequately groomed.  And, as discussed above, the Veteran's remaining symptoms were either contemplated by or more consistent with a 70 percent rating.  

Further, while the Veteran has been granted a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability, the Veteran was not, in the Board's view, totally socially impaired.  While the October 2022 VA examination report shows the Veteran reported marital and social relationship difficulties, the prior June 2022 examination report found that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. And the Veteran self-reported that her decline in participation in social activities, such as pool aerobics, was due to a facility renovation. 

From June 15, 2022, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's symptoms resulted in the level of impairment required for a 100 percent rating.  The criteria for higher disability ratings are not met and the appeal must be denied.

Legal Criteria - Effective Date

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

However, there are exceptions to this rule. Where compensation is awarded pursuant to any Act or administrative issue, the effective date of such award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the Act or administrative issue, and in no event shall the award be retroactive for more than one year from the date of application therefor or the date of the administrative determination of entitlement, whichever is earlier. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).

If the award of compensation is due to a liberalizing change in the law or an administrative issue, the effective date of the award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts but shall not be earlier than the date of the change in the law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(p), 3.114(a). Under the effective date rules for liberalizing laws, where a claim is reviewed on the initiative of VA more than one year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of administrative determination of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(2), (3).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). VA must look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims - formal and informal - for benefits and is required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits.  Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992). 

The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) an intent to apply for benefits; (2) an identification of the benefits sought; and (3) a communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660, 57686.

Moreover, under the rules of the modernized review system (AMA), an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). For decisions rendered after a Higher-Level Review by the RO, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. Id. 

The term "continuous pursuit" only applies to AMA decisions. Specifically, when a claim filed under AMA is granted in an initial decision, the effective date of an AMA initial decision will be the later of the date of the supplemental claim, or the date of entitlement. Thus, even if a supplemental claim is received within one year of a legacy decision, the date of receipt of the supplemental claim will be considered the date of claim for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(h), 3.2500(f).

Upon receipt of an incomplete supplemental claim, VA shall notify the claimant and his or her representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by VA. If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(i).

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, on a facts found basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These facts found include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before they actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008). However, the date entitlement arose is not the date that the RO receives the evidence, but the date to which that evidence refers. McGrath, 14 Vet. App. at 35.

In general, decisions of the RO and the Board that are not appealed in the prescribed time period are final. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103. Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. See Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

Procedural History

On December 6, 2018, the Veteran filed an intent to file form. Within one year, in March 2019, she submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) seeking service connection for PTSD.  In an August 2019 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective the December 6, 2018 date of intent to file.  

In August 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application requesting a higher rating for PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU.  In a rating decision, dated the same month, the RO continued the 30 percent rating assigned for PTSD.  The Veteran filed another VA Form 20-005 Supplemental Claim Application, in August 2020 and August 2021, requesting a higher rating for PTSD and entitlement to a TDIU.  

In a July 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the rating for PTSD from 70 percent to 30 percent, effective June 15, 2022.  

In September 2022, she filed a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, which the RO interpreted as an application for an increased rating for PTSD.  In a January 2023 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to a TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA, both effective June 15, 2022; and denied a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD. 

In a January 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, the Veteran requested a higher rating for PTSD and earlier effective dates for PTSD, TDIU, and DEA claims.  In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO denied the increased rating and earlier effective date claims.  The Veteran filed an April 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD perfecting the appeal before the Board. 

In this Decision, the Board has found that the Veteran has demonstrated continuous pursuit of the AMA appeal since December 6, 2018.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

Analysis - PTSD

The Veteran requests an effective date of December 6, 2018, for the grant of the 70 percent increased rating for PTSD.  See April 2023 HLR-Informal Conference.

In this Decision, the Board has denied a rating in excess of 70 percent prior to June 15, 2022.  Therefore, service-connected PTSD is currently rated 70 percent, effective June 15, 2022.

The Board is bound by the law and regulations governing the date of the Veteran's claim.  The relevant regulation provides that an effective date for an award for compensation is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.    

Because the Veteran has demonstrated continuous pursuit of the AMA appeal since the December 6, 2018 intent to file - this is the date of receipt of the claim.

The Board must now determine when entitlement arose.  Here, the assigned 70 percent rating is predicated upon the June 2022 VA PTSD examination report finding of occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  Therefore, the date entitlement arose was June 15, 2022. 

Here, the date entitlement arose for the 70 percent rating for PTSD was June 15, 2022, which is after the December 6, 2018 date of receipt of claim.  Therefore, the later and proper effective date is the current assigned effective date of June 15, 2022.  There can be no earlier effective date for the grant of the 70 percent increased rating for PTSD.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.    

Analysis - TDIU

The Veteran requests an effective date of December 6, 2018, for the grant of a schedular TDIU.  See April 2023 HLR-Informal Conference.

As entitlement to a TDIU is a form of increased rating claim, the effective date rules for increased compensation claims apply. Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1999); Hurd v. West,13 Vet. App. 449, 451-52 (2000). The effective date shall be the later of either the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). An effective date for a claim for increase may also be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within one year from the date of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). Therefore, the effective date for TDIU is warranted on the date it was factually ascertainable that the veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered her unemployable.

Where a veteran's schedular rating has been evaluated at less than 100 percent, total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or to follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of one or more service-connected disabilities and without regard to advancing age or any nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341(a), 4.16(a).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), a determination concerning unemployability must be made on the basis of service-connected disabilities alone; nonservice-connected disabilities must be disregarded. See Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). Even if the record contains evidence that a veteran's unemployability is a result of other nonservice-connected factors such as age or nonservice-connected conditions, a finding must still be made, without regard to the nonservice-connected conditions, as to whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities are sufficiently incapacitating as to render her unemployable. Id. 

The veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue must be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to secure or to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.15. While the rating is based primarily upon the average impairment of earning capacity, full consideration must be given to unusual physical or mental effects in individual cases, to peculiar effects of occupational activities, to defects in physical or mental endowment preventing the usual amount of success in overcoming the handicap of disability, and to the effect of combinations of disability. Id. 

Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal, and which permits the individual to earn a living wage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). The ability to work only a few hours a day or only sporadically does not qualify as an ability to engage in substantially gainful employment. Id. Marginal employment shall generally be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. Marginal employment may also be established, on a fact found basis, when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold, including but not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop. Id. Consideration must be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination. Id. 

Certain percentage requirements must be satisfied in order to qualify for schedular consideration of entitlement to TDIU. Specifically, if unemployability is the result of only one service-connected disability, this disability must be ratable at 60 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §4.16(a). If it is the result of two or more service-connected disabilities, at least one must be ratable at 40 percent or more, with the other disabilities sufficient to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. The existence or degree of nonservice-connected disabilities or previous unemployability status will be disregarded where the percentages referred to in this paragraph for the service-connected disability or disabilities are met and in the judgment of the rating agency such service-connected disabilities render the veteran unemployable. Id. 

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that prior to June 15, 2022, a TDIU is not warranted. 

Prior to June 15, 2022, the Veteran had the following service-connected disabilities: PTSD, rated 30 percent; left knee replacement rated 30 percent; right knee limitation of flexion, rated 20 percent; and chronic headaches rated 30 percent prior to January 26, 2022 and noncompensable thereafter.  She was also service connected for hypertension, left knee scar, and right knee scar all rated noncompensable (0 percent).  

The Veteran's left knee and right knee disabilities (i.e. disabilities of the lower extremities) may be recognized as "one disability" for the purpose of meeting the percentage requirements for a schedular TDIU.  With consideration of the bilateral factor, from August 17, 2021 to January 25, 2022 the Veteran's combined evaluation for service-connected disabilities was 80 percent.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.25, 4.26.  From January 26, 2022 to June 14, 2022, her combined rating was 60 percent. Id.  

Based on the foregoing, from August 17, 2021 to January 25, 2022, the Veteran met the percentage requirements for consideration of a schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), because she had a combined rating of 80 percent with "one disability" rated at least 40 percent.  From January 26, 2022 to June 14, 2022, the Veteran did not meet the requisite percentage requirements for a schedular TDIU.  Id. 

As the Veteran met the percentage requirements for a schedular TDIU from August 17, 2021 to January 26, 2022, the Board will now turn to whether her service-connected disabilities prevented her from working during this period.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is a recipient of Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits and requests an earlier effective date for TDIU based on being a SSA benefits recipient.  She has been a recipient of SSA benefits since November 2009 due to primary diagnosis of Affective/Mood Disorders.  Although the Veteran is service connected for PTSD, given the different standards utilized by VA and SSA in determining disability and unemployability, VA is not bound by a SSA determination. Collier v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 413, 417 (1991) (Although VA is required to consider the SSA's findings, the Board is not bound by the findings of disability or unemployability made by other tribunals, including SSA). The Board's conclusion is rendered independent of the SSA determination and based on a comprehensive review of the record before it.

The Veteran retired in 2008 from working as a nurse. From August 17, 2021 to January 25, 2022, the Veteran was in receipt of a 30 percent disability rating for service-connected PTSD based on a finding of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation.  See August 2019 VA Examination Report. 

Turning to functional impairment caused by service-connected knee and headache disabilities. On August 2021 VA knee and lower leg conditions examination, an examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities would impact her ability to perform heavy lifting, squatting, prolonged walking, sitting, or standing, ascending or descending stairs, and standing up from a chair.  Due to her knees, she would miss up to one week of work over 12 months.  As for service-connected headaches, at worst, the Veteran would lose up to one week work time over 12 months and her condition may impact the ability to work in environments with bright lights, loud noise, and prolonged working hours.  See December 2020 VA headaches examination.  At the most recent VA headaches examination in January 2022, an examiner opined that service-connected headaches had no functional impact.  

Based on the Veteran's employment history and functional limitations described above, the Board finds that from August 17, 2021 to January 25, 2022, her service-connected disabilities alone did not render her unemployable. In this regard, the Board recognizes that service-connected PTSD, bilateral knee, and headache disabilities caused some functional impairment as detailed above.  However, at most, examiners have opined that the Veteran would miss one week of work during a 12-month period due to service-connected knee and headache disabilities.  

As for service-connected PTSD, and examiner opined that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation. Further, there are no medical opinions, and the evidence does not otherwise suggest that during the applicable period the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded substantially gainful employment.

The evidence, in the Board's estimation, persuasively weighs against the claim for a schedular TDIU prior to June 15, 2022. Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Based on the foregoing, the date entitlement arose for a schedular TDIU was June 15, 2022.  As TDIU is part and parcel of the PTSD claim, the date of application is December 6, 2018. Because the date of entitlement is later, an effective date prior to June 15, 2022, for a schedular TDIU is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  

Analysis - DEA

With regard to the effective date assigned for DEA benefits, basic eligibility for DEA benefits exists if the veteran: 1) was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable or died in service and 2) has a permanent total service-connected disability; or had a permanent total service-connected disability at the date of death; or died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501.

Here, the date of application is December 6, 2018, based on the continuously pursued PTSD claim. Pursuant to this Decision, the Veteran is in receipt of a TDIU due to service-connected disabilities, effective June 15, 2022. This is the date entitlement arose and the date that the Veteran met the criteria for DEA benefits because a TDIU is considered a "permanent and total" disability, therefore, if a TDIU is established, basic eligibility to DEA benefits have also been established. 38 U.S.C. § 3501.

?

Therefore, an effective date prior to June 15, 2022, for the award of DEA benefits is not warranted because the criteria were not met prior to this date.  38 U.S.C. § 3501.  The appeal is denied.
