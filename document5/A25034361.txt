ORDER

Whether appellant's character of discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran received an Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge that is not a bar to VA benefits.

2.  The Veteran's January 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) does not identify a rating decision of which the Veteran was notified within one year prior to filing the NOD, and the record does not include a rating decision or determination letter denying appellant's character of discharge from service as a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits at any time prior to the filing of the January 2024 NOD.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of whether appellant's character of discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from July 2019 to October 2023.  He received an Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge.

As discussed below, this matter is being dismissed, because it comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) without a rating decision or determination letter of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  This appeal is being adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

In the appellant's January 2024 AMA Notice of Disagreement (NOD), he elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.     

It is important to highlight that matters have been associated with the file outside of the evidence window.  In this regard, VA has already granted the appellant disability benefits for service connection for VA compensation purposes in an April 2024 rating decision.

1. Whether appellant's character of discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits

This appeal was commenced by a January 2024 AMA NOD.    

In the January 2024 AMA NOD, the Veteran appears to be appealing his service discharge characterization in so far as he listed his last day of active-duty service, as the decision on appeal in this claim.

Importantly, to the extent the Veteran is appealing his own service discharge, VA does not have authority to alter the findings of the service department.  38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a); Spencer v. West, 13. Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000); Venturella v. Gober, 11 Vet. App. 240, 241 (1997); Cahall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 232, 237 (1994); Duro v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 530, 532 (1992).  

Accordingly, the VA has no authority to alter the claimant's discharge classification, as he, in effect, is requesting.  The claimant's recourse is with the service department.  Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416 (1994).

In this claim, there is no denial for whether appellant's character of discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits in the one year prior to the January 2024 AMA NOD filing. 

Here, the Board notes that the record is silent for a decision in October 2023 as alleged by the appellant in his NOD, and there is no decision notifying him within one year prior to the filing of his January 2024 NOD, denying him receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits.

Put simply, there is no case or controversy in this claim because the appellant is already entitled to receive VA compensation and healthcare benefits for disabilities incurred or aggravated in service based on his current General Under Honorable Conditions discharge.

Given all the above, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; see also Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994) (noting that when the law is dispositive of the claim, then the claim must, as a matter of law, be denied because of the absence of legal merit or lack of entitlement under the law).  

In this case, the January 2024 NOD does not identify an existing determination being appealed.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the Veteran's appeal, and it is dismissed.
