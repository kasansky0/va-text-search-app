FINDING OF FACT

On March 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in these appeals, the Board received notification from the Veteran's attorney that a withdrawal of the appeals listed on the title page was requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant or his authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from February 1968 to February 1970. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement the appeal is withdrawn.  In March and April 2025, correspondence from the Veteran's attorney was associated with the claims file. Therein, the Attorney requested that the Veteran's hearing request be withdrawn, and the pending claims be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). 

The attorney's written statement complies with 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1) (form and content required for withdrawal of an appeal) because it is in writing, includes the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA claims file number, and a statement of the desire to withdraw the appeals.  

As a result of the Veteran's appropriate withdrawal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration and the appeal is dismissed.
