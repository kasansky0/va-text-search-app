ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability, to include as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left ankle disability, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right ankle disability is less likely than not related to the Veteran's active-duty service.

2. The Veteran's right ankle disability is not caused or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected left ankle disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right ankle disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from December 1992 to December 1994.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. The AMA modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019 effective date of the modernized review system.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review option. 

For the Direct Lane docket, the Board's review is limited to the evidentiary record at the time of the RO decision on appeal. See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, (2021). For this case, that means the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after September 13, 2024.

The Board interprets the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review option with an indication of a decision being rendered within 365 days as well as statements of record as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim finding that the Veteran does not wish to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in the denial of service connection.

Additionally, service connection may be granted on a secondary basis when the evidence establishes (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.? See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998); 38?C.F.R. §?3.310.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has a right ankle disability related to his active-duty service, or alternatively, secondary to his service-connected left ankle disability. The Board finds the elements of service connection have not been met.

With respect to current disability, in the June 2024 VA examination the Veteran reported right ankle pain. It was noted the Veteran experienced painful motion and decreased range of motion. The examiner found the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis for his right ankle. However, the Board notes that "pain in the absence of a presently-diagnosed condition can cause functional impairment."  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Thus, pain alone is sufficient to establish the existence of a present disability if the pain reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  See id.  Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran has a current disability.

With respect to in-service incurrence, during the June 2024 VA examination the Veteran reported that his right ankle pain began during service in 1994 after injuring his left ankle. He stated that his left ankle pain caused him to compensate on his right ankle which caused pain. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and observable events within the realm of his personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470-471 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Furthermore, the Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of these statements, as they have been consistent throughout his appeal.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements sufficiently establish the in-service incurrence element of this claim.

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current disability and in-service incurrence. The record contains a negative nexus opinion regarding direct service connection.

In the June 2024 VA examination, the examiner found that without a diagnosis, the examiner could not provide a specific etiology regarding the Veteran's right ankle pain. Thus, the examiner found that a nexus could not be established. Accordingly, service connection on a direct basis cannot be established.

With respect to secondary service connection, the Board notes that the Veteran is presently service connected for left ankle tendonitis. Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran's primary disability is service connected.

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's left ankle disability caused or aggravated the Veteran's right ankle disability. The record contains a negative nexus opinion in this regard.

In the June 2024 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined the Veteran's right ankle disability was less likely than not related to the Veteran's left ankle disability. The examiner noted that medical literature did not support that an injury to one joint would cause a significant impact on another unless the initial injury resulted in major muscle or nerve damage causing partial or complete paralysis or shortening of the injured limb resulting in length discrepancy of more than 5 centimeters so that the individuals gait pattern had been altered. The examiner found this level of severity of injury was not supported by the evidence of record or upon examination. Accordingly, a nexus cannot be established on a secondary basis.

Thus, service connection for a right ankle disability has not been established on either a direct or secondary basis and the Veteran's claim is denied.
