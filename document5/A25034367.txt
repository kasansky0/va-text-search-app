REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for knee condition, left is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for knee condition, right is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1985 to March 2008.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for left and right knee conditions, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that on April 22, 2024, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), on these same issues. As a general matter, a claimant who has filed for review under one of the AMA review options may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). In this instance, the April 2024 HLR request was rejected upon receipt by the AOJ, such that there was no concurrent election of review options. See July 2024 Correspondence.

1. Entitlement to service connection for knee condition, left is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for knee condition, right is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his claimed left and right knee conditions. He contends that his claimed knee conditions are related to his active service. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also April 2024 VA Form 10182. Specifically, the Veteran contends that for the majority of his 22.5-year military career he was aboard ships and walking around and/or climbing up and down ladders while the ship was in motion, causing strain to his knees. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ at 13. Additionally, the Veteran asserts that during service he had to perform a Physical Readiness Test every quarter, which also contributed to pain around and under the kneecaps and behind the knees. Id. 

The Board cannot yet adjudicate the Veteran's claims for service connection because the evidence of record prior to the AOJ decision on appeal was sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist and no VA examination was performed. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) (explaining that the Board shall remand to the AOJ for correction of a pre-decisional duty to assist error); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006); 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). 

Specifically, a medical examination is warranted when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability, (2) evidence of an in-service event, injury, or disease, (3) an indication that the current disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another disability already service connected, and (4) the evidence is otherwise insufficient to adjudicate the claim. See McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 81. When all four elements are satisfied, a Veteran is entitled to a medical examination. Id.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the April AOJ decision on appeal conceded the following favorable findings concerning the Veteran's claims: (1) the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), based on his qualifying service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations; (2) the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset in service, as the service treatment records (STRs) dated March 2006 show that the Veteran reported left knee pain; and (3) the Veteran has been diagnosed with right knee patellofemoral syndrome, as documented in the July 2023 Houston VAMC medical records. No clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record to rebut these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Here, the competent evidence of record satisfies the four McLendon elements such that an examination is required. First, there is evidence of persistent symptoms of a disability. As noted above, the Veteran stated that he has bilateral knee pain. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ at 13. Additionally, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right knee patellofemoral syndrome. See December 2023 CAPRI at 16, 23.

Second, there is competent evidence of an in-service event based on the Veteran's lay statements. The Veteran complained of left knee pain in-service. See December 1991 STR - Medical - Photocopy at 23. Additionally, the Veteran asserts that climbing up and down ladders on moving ships and completing physical trainings put strain on his knees and caused pain to the kneecap. See November 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ at 13. Further, the Veteran received multiple Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, confirming periods of service aboard a ship. See April 2024 DPRIS Response at 130.

Third, there is an indication that the Veteran's left and right knee conditions may be associated with the Veteran's service because he has asserted that he has had continuous symptoms since service. Id. Fourth, the evidence is otherwise insufficient for the Board to adjudicate the claim. Because the McLendon test is satisfied, remand is warranted.

Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the claims must be remanded to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error of not obtaining a VA examination and opinion. See 38 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; C.F.R. 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of his left and right knee conditions and obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician. The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to, and reviewed by the examiner prior to rendering an opinion.

The examiner should identify all left and right knee conditions present during the pendency of the appeal, or approximate thereto.

For each knee condition identified, the clinician must opine on:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any identified disability had its onset during the Veteran's active service or is otherwise etiologically related to such service, to include training exercises and wear on the knees from climbing up and down ladders on a moving ship.

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports must be considered. If the examiner rejects the Veteran's reports, he or she must provide a reason for doing so.

Adequate reasons and bases for any opinion rendered must be provided. The claims file should be made available to the examiner, who should review the entire claims folder.  

All opinions expressed by the examiner must be accompanied by a complete rationale. 

If an opinion cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the reviewing clinician must provide a complete explanation for why an opinion cannot be rendered. In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.
