REMANDED

Whether a waiver of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $8,143.24, is warranted, to include the questions of whether the overpayment was properly created and/or whether the creation of the overpayment was due to the sole administrative error on the part of VA, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from November 1979 to February 1980; from December 2004 to April 2005 and from April 2005 to May 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Whether a waiver of an overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $8,143.24, is warranted, to include the questions of whether the overpayment was properly created and/or whether the creation of the overpayment was due to the sole administrative error on the part of VA

The Veteran contends that after his 2010 divorce was finalized, he reported it to all appropriate agencies, including the Montgomery VA Regional Office.  See January 2024 VA Form 21-4138.  He contends that he removed from the DEERS system; Tri-Care and the ID pool.  Id. Alternatively, he requests a waiver of the overpayment debt.  Id.

In a November 2023 VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add or Remove Dependents), the Veteran reported he divorced T. on March 10, 2020. 

An overpayment debt in the amount of $8,143.24 was created as a result of the retroactive termination of the spousal benefits.

The Board construes the Veteran's statements as a challenge to the validity of the debt.

The Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has directed that appellate review by the Board on the Veteran's waiver claim must be deferred pending formal adjudication of the Veteran's challenge to the validity of the debt, which must be undertaken by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Schaper v. Derwinski,1 Vet. App.430, 437 (1991) ("when a Veteran raises the validity of the debt as part of a waiver application . . .it is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion to adjudicate the waiver application without first deciding a veteran's challenge to the lawfulness of the debt asserted against him or her"); VAOPGCPREC 6-98 (July 24, 1998) (holding that when a veteran challenges the validity of the debt and seeks waiver of the debt, the [Regional Office] must first fully review the debt's validity and, if the office believes the debt to be valid, prepare a written decision fully justifying the validity of the debt before referring the waiver request to the Committee on Waivers and Compromises). A debtor may dispute the amount or existence of a debt, which is a right that may be exercised separately from a request for waiver or at the same time. 38 C.F.R.§ 1.911 (c)(1). Resolution of the creation issue must precede consideration of the waiver issue.

The Board recognizes that the Schaper decision was made in the context of the legacy appeals process and this decision is made under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of either a pre-decisional duty to assist error or "any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. In Schaper, the Court decided it was an error to fail to first adjudicate validity of debt based on the statutory and regulatory waiver consideration of "equity and good conscious." See Schaper, 1 Vet. App. at 437; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b). Additionally, the standard of "no reasonable possibility" is not fulfilled under the "mere belief that the likelihood" of substantiating the claim is low. See Jones v. Wilkie, 918 F.3d 922, 926 (2019) (interpreting similar language from 38 U.S.C. §5103A). The Board, thus, considers it a correctible error by the AOJ in satisfying their regulatory and statutory duties under38 U.S.C. § 5302 (b) and 38 C.F.R. § 1.965 and that correction raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.

Given the state of the record, a remand is warranted for the AOJ to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error. Namely, the AOJ has not addressed the Veteran's argument as to whether the debt is valid. Therefore, the Board finds that review of the debt's validity must first be resolved. Accordingly, remand under the AMA for this circumstance remains appropriate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the issue of whether the debt in the amount of $8,143.24 was validly created, to include notifying the Veteran of how this debt was created and the reasons the AOJ found its creation to be valid.

The AOJ should address the Veteran's January 2024 statements that he timely notified the Montgomery VA Regional Office and other governmental systems, including DEERS system; Tri-Care and the ID pool about his divorce.
