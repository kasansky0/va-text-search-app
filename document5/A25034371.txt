FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's Intent to File was received on August 13, 2019.  

2. Exposure to herbicide agents is conceded based on the Veteran's service in Thailand during the Vietnam Era; Parkinson's disease is one of the enumerated diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents.

3. The Veteran's Parkinson's disease and its associated disabilities, including major depressive disorder, predate his August 2019 Intent to File.

4. The Veteran is married, submitted a VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents in conjunction with his current claim, and was awarded an effective date of September 1, 2022, for dependency benefits for his spouse based on the prior effective date assigned for his service-connected disabilities; this decision awards an earlier effective date of August 13, 2019, for those disabilities.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to October 1970, including service in Thailand from September 1969 to October 1970.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2023 and February 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The January 2023 rating decision granted service connection for Parkinson's disease, left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and sexual dysfunction; denied service connection for pericardial constriction; and awarded special monthly compensation (SMC) for loss of use of a creative organ.

The February 2023 rating decision granted service connection for major depressive disorder.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket and appealed all of the issues listed above including the associated issues of an earlier effective date for the award of spouse dependency benefits and a request to maximize the Veteran's benefits by considering whether any additional special monthly compensation (SMC) benefits are warranted.

The Board adjudicated this appeal in a June 2024 decision, considering only the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 and February 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal with regard to their respective issues, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).   In November 2024 the Court granted a joint motion for partial remand (JMR) of the Veteran and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (the Parties), vacated the June 2024 Board decision's denial of earlier effective dates for the grants of service connection for Parkinson's disease, left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth (pneumogastric, vagus) cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth (pneumogastric, vagus) cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, sexual dysfunction, special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of creative organ, and major depressive disorder; and for the award of spouse dependency benefits; and remanded that portion of the claim to the Board for action consistent with the terms of the JMR.

Earlier Effective Dates

Unless specifically provided otherwise in Chapter 51 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date of separation from service if the claim is received within one year of separation; otherwise, the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a).  The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).

Treatment records do not constitute informal claims when service connection has not yet been established for the condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157; Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002). While the VA should broadly interpret submissions from a Veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised.  Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995).

11. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for sexual dysfunction

In a January 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for Parkinson's disease and its associated disabilities of left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and sexual dysfunction, all with an effective date of August 10, 2022.  The Veteran has appealed this effective date for all disabilities.

The Veteran separated from active-duty service in October 1970.  He did not claim service connection for any disabilities at that time and did not file a claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease or any associated disability within one year of his separation from service.

The Veteran's Intent to File was received on August 13, 2019.  In July 2020, within one year of his Intent to File, the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for Parkinson's disease and pericardial constriction.  Thus, the date of claim is August 13, 2019.

The Board must then determine when entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's disease arose.  In August 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act of 2022), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022, amended 38 U.S.C. § 1116 by expanding the eligibility for the presumption of herbicide agent exposure.  Under the PACT Act, effective no earlier than August 10, 2022, veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, are now presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents as a result of that service, without regard to where on the base they were located or what military occupational specialty they performed.

Here, the Veteran was granted service connection for Parkinson's disease and its associated disabilities (left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and sexual dysfunction) in a January 2023 rating decision based on the PACT Act's expansion of the presumption of herbicide exposure to include veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam Era.

The remaining question before the Board is whether the evidence of record establishes that entitlement to service connection for these disabilities arose prior to the effective date of the PACT Act.  To that end, the Veteran argues that he had actual exposure to herbicide agents during his service in Thailand.  Indeed, the record does not suggest and the Veteran does not contend that his Parkinson's disease began during service or is otherwise relate to any disease or injury during service other than herbicide exposure.  Prior to the PACT Act, no presumption of herbicide exposure was available for veterans who served in Thailand.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection required a finding of actual herbicide exposure.

Here, the Board finds that the nature of the Veteran's service in Thailand is sufficient to establish exposure to herbicide agents and such exposure is conceded.  Moreover, certain chronic diseases, including Parkinson's disease, will be presumed related to herbicide exposure in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  The record shows a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in 2017, prior to the Veteran's claim.  Additionally, the August 2022 Parkinson's disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) also noted the presence of the associated disabilities of left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and sexual dysfunction.  Thus, the evidence suggests that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease and all of its associated disabilities were present during the entire appeals period.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for Parkinson's disease arose prior to the date of claim.  

As noted above, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).  As described above, the Board finds that the date entitlement arose predates the date of claim.  Therefore, an earlier effective date of August 13, 2019, the date the Intent to file was received, is warranted for the grants of service connection for Parkinson's disease, left upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, right upper extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left lower extremity bradykinesia and tremor, left tenth cranial nerve speech changes, right tenth cranial nerve speech changes, left stooped posture, right stooped posture, constipation, loss of sense of smell, and sexual dysfunction.  To that extent, the appeal is granted.

12. An effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for special monthly compensation based on loss of use of creative organ

SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) is warranted if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the loss of use of one or more creative organs.  In this case, the effective date of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k) is the effective date of entitlement to service connection for sexual dysfunction.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (a).

As explained above, an earlier effective date of August 13, 2019, for the grant of service connection for sexual dysfunction is granted to reflect a finding that entitlement to service connection arose before the August 2019 date of claim.  Entitlement to SMC is directly linked to entitlement to service connection.  Therefore, an effective date of August 13, 2019, but not earlier, for SMC due to loss of use of a creative organ is also warranted.

13. An effective date earlier than August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for major depressive disorder

The Veteran separated from active-duty service in October 1970.  He did not claim service connection for any disabilities at that time and did not file a claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability within one year of his separation from service.

On July 29, 2020, the Veteran submitted private medical records in conjunction with his formal claim for Parkinson's disease.  This included a November 2017 letter which noted the Veteran's reports of depression.  Ultimately, the August 2022 Parkinson's disease disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) found that mild depression was a mental manifestation of the Veteran's Parkinson's disease.  Thus, the Veteran's depression is part and parcel of his Parkinson's disease and has the same date of claim, August 13, 2019, when the Veteran's Intent to File was received.

Next, the Board must establish when entitlement to service connection first arose.  Again, this disability was found to be secondary to the Veteran's Parkinson's disease.  The record does not suggest and the Veteran does not contend that his major depressive disorder began during service or are otherwise relate to any disease or injury during service other than herbicide exposure and/or Parkinson's disease.  As explained above, an earlier effective date of August 13, 2019, for the grant of service connection for sexual dysfunction is granted to granted to reflect a finding that entitlement to service connection arose before the August 2019 date of claim.  The record shows that the Veteran's depression, which has since been attributed to his Parkinson's disease, likewise predated this claim.

As noted above, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).  As the date entitlement arose predates the August 13, 2019, date of claim, an earlier effective date of August 13, 2019, but not earlier, is warranted.

14. An effective date earlier than September 1, 2022, for award of spouse dependency benefits

The Veteran currently received additional spouse dependency benefits, effective September 1, 2022.  He is seeking an earlier effective date for this benefit.

Any veteran who is entitled to disability compensation, and whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including for a spouse and a stepchild.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4 (b)(2).  

When determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates provided that sufficient evidence is received: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) the effective date of the qualifying disability rating; or (4) the date of commencement of the Veteran's award.  38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b).

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits begins the first day of the month following the effective date.   However, beneficiaries will be deemed to be in receipt of monetary benefits during the period between the effective date of the award and the date payment commences.  38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686(c) requesting that his wife be added as a dependent.  VA then retroactively awarded the Veteran dependent spouse benefits effective September 1, 2022, the first day of the month following the effective date of his service-connected disabilities described above.  

Here, based on the earlier effective dates awarded above, the effective date of the Veteran's qualifying disability rating is now August 13, 2019.  Thus, entitlement to the additional dependent spouse benefits must be adjusted to cover the entire time he has received disability benefit payments.

Based on the foregoing, an effective date earlier of September 1, 2019, the first day of the month following the effective date of his service-connected disabilities, for the Veteran's dependent spouse benefits is warranted.  To that extent, the appeal is granted.
