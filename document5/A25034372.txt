REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1979 to January 1991 and February 2003 to June 2003.

A March 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), denied the Veteran's claims for, among other things, service connection for left and right foot, left and right shoulder, and back disabilities.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review for the issues of entitlement to service connection for right foot, left foot, and back disabilities. A June 2023 rating decision found a duty to assist error in the March 2023 rating decision and requested VA examinations. A November 2023 rating decision denied service connection for right foot, left foot, and back disabilities. 

In the December 2023, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board will only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction's (AOJ) March 2023 rating decision for the issues of entitlement to service connection for right and left shoulder disabilities and the November 2023 rating decision for the issues of entitlement to service connection for right foot, left foot, and back disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

As a final introductory matter, the Board notes that in his December 2023 NOD, the Veteran indicated that he wished to appeal ten issues. However, five of those issues - entitlement to service connection for left and right hip strain, entitlement to service connection for an adjustment disorder, and entitlement to increased disability ratings for left and right knee conditions - were already pending on appeal before the Board in a separate Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) appeal stream, stemming from a separate NOD filed in June 2023. Those five issues were addressed by the Board in a March 2025 Board decision. As such, these matters are not presently before the Board.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disability is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right shoulder disability is remanded.

5. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

Because the Veteran is seeking service connection for right and left foot and back disabilities, as secondary to his service-connected bilateral knee arthritis, the Board finds that these issues are intertwined with the claims that were remanded in the March 2025 Board decision. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991) (two issues are "inextricably intertwined" when they are so closely tied together that the final decision on one issue cannot be rendered until a decision on the other issues has been rendered). Additionally, because the Veteran is seeking service connection for right and left shoulder disabilities as secondary to his chronic back pain, the Board finds that these issues are also intertwined with the claim of entitlement to a back disability which is remanded herein. Id.  

As such, the Board finds that remand of the issues on appeal is warranted.   

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Once the March 2025 Board remand directives have been accomplished, readjudicate the Veteran's claims for service connection for right and left shoulder, right and left foot, and back disabilities.
