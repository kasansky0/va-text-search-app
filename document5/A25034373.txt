ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of the November 2023 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (hereinafter VA Form 10182) concerning the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, the Veteran already had a Supplemental Claim pending at the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) regarding that same issue.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 5104C; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.201, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from December 2004 until her honorable discharge in March 2013.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As a general matter, within one year of the date the AOJ issues a decision, a claimant may elect one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), 20.205; see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 26 (2023).

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or Notice of Disagreement appeal to the Board is withdrawn. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU. On November 3, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim for entitlement to a TDIU addressed in the October 2023 rating decision. On November 7, 2023, during the pendency of the supplemental claim, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 seeking review of the denial of entitlement to a TDIU in the October 2023 rating decision.

Here, the Veteran did not withdraw her request for review stemming from the supplemental claim received November 3, 2023. Therefore, the appeal stemming from the later-submitted VA Form 10182 was erroneously docketed by the Board. As the present appeal is a concurrent election prohibited under controlling law and regulation, the appeal must be dismissed. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).
