ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD, is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim on March 1, 2017; his original service-connection claim for PTSD was received on October 24, 2017.

2. The Veteran's claim for service connection remained pending, or continuously prosecuted, until a 100 percent rating for PTSD was granted in an April 2, 2020, rating decision. The effective date of the grant was August 20, 2019.

3. A private psychological evaluation dated April 13, 2017, received by VA on October 24, 2017, credibly documents psychiatric symptoms that more nearly approximated total occupational and social impairment as of March 1, 2017. 

4. The Veteran's service-connected PTSD rendered him permanently and totally disabled as of March 1, 2017.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD, were met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, were met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 3.400, 21.3021(r).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from December 1974 to December 1977.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 higher-level review rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 11, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

Procedural History

On March 1, 2017, VA received the Veteran's intent to file, followed by a claim for service connection for PTSD within one year. A May 1, 2018, rating decision granted service connection and assigned a noncompensable evaluation. The issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating was deferred for a VA addendum opinion. A September 11, 2018, rating decision increased the initial rating to 30 percent, effective March 1, 2017. The Veteran's spouse submitted a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) on his behalf in April 2019, asserting entitlement to an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating.

Although the NOD was submitted on an outdated form, VA processed it under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), which resulted in the June 19, 2020, higher-level review decision on appeal. No statement of the case or supplemental statement of the case was ever issued on the specific matter of an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating. As such, the Board finds that the claim stream remained open, or continuously prosecuted, from March 1, 2017.

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (prior to February 19, 2019, "an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase" rather than "initial claim or supplemental claim"). The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim. (See original claim, § 3.160(b)). 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(1).

Eligibility to DEA arises once the Veteran is found to be permanently and totally disabled due to his service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a). The effective date of eligibility generally mirrors the effective date of the award upon which the eligibility is based. See 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(r).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD, is granted.

The issue on appeal is whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 20, 2019, for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD. 

The Board concludes that he is.

A 100 percent rating for PTSD is warranted when symptoms result in total occupational and social impairment. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

The record contains a private psychological evaluation dated April 13, 2017, received by VA on October 24, 2017. That report documents severe PTSD symptoms, including hypervigilance, paranoia, social isolation, nightmares, concentration deficits, impaired judgment, and chronic unemployment. While the report includes a Global Assessment Functioning (GAF) score of 45, the Board assigns no probative weight to that metric, consistent with Golden v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 221 (2018) and VA's adoption of DSM-5. 

The April 2017 report did not distinguish which disabling effects were attributable solely to PTSD as opposed to co-occurring alcohol use disorder. Under Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998), when such a distinction cannot be made, all psychiatric symptoms must be attributed to the service-connected condition. Aside from that, the Board finds the April 2017 private psychological evaluation report nonetheless probative. See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) (if the opinion is merely lacking in detail, then it may be given some weight based upon the amount of information and analysis it contains).

The April 2018 VA examination concluded that the Veteran's PTSD was mild and that most impairment was due to alcohol use disorder. However, even that report acknowledged anxiety, depressed mood, impaired judgment, and difficulty maintaining effective relationships - which are not inconsistent with earlier private findings. Compare April 2018 VA Examination with April 2017 Private Evaluation. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the criteria for a 100 percent rating for PTSD were met as of March 1, 2017, the date of the original claim. 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, is granted.

The issue now becomes whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date earlier than August 20, 2019, for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 

The Board concludes that he is.

DEA eligibility arises once a Veteran is found to be permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected conditions. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a). The April 2, 2020, rating decision that granted DEA found the Veteran's PTSD rendered him permanently and totally disabled as of August 20, 2019. The Board now finds that the Veteran's PTSD met the criteria for total disability as of March 1, 2017. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(r), when eligibility to DEA is established by a rating decision that assigns an earlier effective date for permanent and total (P&T) disability, the effective date for the award of DEA benefits may be assigned as the date the P&T disability is found to have existed. Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 1, 2017, for eligibility to DEA under Chapter 35, is granted.
