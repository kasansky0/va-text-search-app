ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus disability first manifested many years after active service, and the persuasive evidence of record weighs against finding that it is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from July 2002 to June 2006. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system (which VA interprets to include tinnitus) are considered chronic diseases that will be presumed related to service if they were noted or diagnosed as chronic in service; or if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year after active duty discharge; or if chronicity or continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service; with no intervening cause. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d. 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a)(3).

In deciding the Veteran's claim, the VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event; or whether the persuasive evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.S. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus due to his noise exposure during active duty.

The AOJ made favorable findings in the June 2023 rating decision in that the Veteran has a current tinnitus disability and conceded in-service hazardous noise exposure due to the Veterans military occupational specialty (MOS) of cannon crewmember. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran's current tinnitus disability has its onset in or is related to hazardous noise exposure during active military service. The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's tinnitus disability began during active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints of hearing problems, tinnitus, or similar symptoms. Post-service treatment records do not reveal complaint or symptoms of tinnitus within one year of separation.

The Veteran filed his claim for compensation for a tinnitus disability in March 2023. Included in his claim, the Veteran stated that "[d]uring my career in military, I was a 13B canon crew member field artillery. I deployed to Iraq. Training in Garrison we went to field to train often with constantly shooting round and then while in Iraq from gun fire. IED blasts and shooting artillery. I have ringing in my ears." See VBMS document titled, "VA f21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim," receipt date 03/02/2023 page 13 of 14. Notably, the Veteran did not state when his tinnitus began. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for a separate claim in November 2010. At that time, the VA examiner conducted a full physical examination and noted "no objective findings of tinnitus." See VBMS document titled, "VA Examination," receipt date 11/09/2010. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for tinnitus in April 2023. During the examination, the Veteran reported that he experienced onset of tinnitus in 2016. The Veteran's relevant medical history is noted as no noise exposure prior to military service; military noise exposure to gunfire, grenades, howitzers, rocket launchers, IEDs, incoming fire, mortars, aircraft and helicopters, and right-handed firearm, but "hearing protection was worn when possible;" and that his post-service noise exposure includes his occupation as a corrections officer with right-handed firearm qualifications. The Veteran reported gradual onset of symptoms, reported symptoms of intermittent ringing and humming that alternates between his ears, and symptoms occur three times a week for two minutes. See VBMS document titled, "C&P Exam," receipt date 04/12/2023.

The April 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The VA examiner cited the Veteran's May 2002 entrance examination that shows hearing within normal limits however there is no separation hearing test in the Veteran's service records. The examiner explained that "[a]lthough the veteran was subjected to significant hazardous noise exposure, tinnitus onset is reported as 2016 which is 10 years post-separation from the military. MOS was Cannon crewmember with a high probability of noise exposures. Veteran was in combat. Badges were Iraq campaign medal and [Global War on Terrorism] GWOT expeditionary medal. While noise exposure during service [July 18, 2002, to June 30, 2006] is conceded and the relationship of noise exposure, auditory damage and tinnitus is well-established, auditory damage and tinnitus are not conceded based on noise alone. Veteran was in the reserves from [July 1, 2006, to July 12, 2010]. The [November 9, 2010, VA examination] states no objective findings of tinnitus. Tinnitus related to noise exposure occurs at time of exposure, not latent onset. There must be a nexus of auditory damage to relate current tinnitus to military noise exposure and not another etiology. The evidence is against the nexus in this case. It is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) that the Veteran's tinnitus is caused by or the result of military noise exposure." Id.

The Veteran's file is silent for any other statements, reports, or evidence relevant to the Veteran's tinnitus disability. 

The Veteran is competent to report his in-service experiences and observable symptoms. He reports in-service loud noise from combat and training related gunfire, grenades, howitzers, rocket launchers, IEDs, incoming fire, mortars, aircraft, and helicopters. His reports are credible as they are consistent with his service as shown by his service records. As such, the Board finds the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise during service and due to his military duties. However, the Veteran also notes tinnitus first occurring in 2016, approximately 10 years after separation from active duty service. As such, a continuity of symptoms is not established, such that the presumption for a chronic disability could be applied.

In this case, the Board assigns great probative weight to the VA examiner's opinion. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on review of the claims file, accurate history, incorporates the Veteran's competent lay statements, and provides a reasoned explanation that contains clear conclusions with supporting medical data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

As the VA examiner opined the Veteran's current tinnitus symptoms are less likely than not related to service, there is no probative evidence linking the Veteran's tinnitus to the conceded in-service noise exposure. The Board finds that the evidence is not in relative equipoise and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve. 38 U.S.S. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53-56. Accordingly, the elements required for service connection have not been satisfied, the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, and the claim for service connection for tinnitus must be denied.
