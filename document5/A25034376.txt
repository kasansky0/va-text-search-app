REMANDED

Entitlement to a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits, in the amount of $5,492.43, to include a challenge to the validity of the debt is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 2004 to August 2016. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 administrative decision, issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC).

Following the February 2024 COWC decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD). The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted or received after the February 2024 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As discussed below, in addition to claiming entitlement to a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $5,492.43 the Veteran has also challenged the validity of the debt. Thus, the claim has been expanded to include that challenge, as reflected on the title page.

Entitlement to a waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits, in the amount of $5,492.43, to include a challenge to the validity of the debt is remanded.

The Veteran has requested a waiver of the debt, as well as challenged the validity of the overpayment. Specifically, the Veteran has argued that the overpayment, which supposedly results from his concurrent receipt of military drill pay and VA compensation benefits, is invalid, as he specifically waived his military drill pay to elect VA compensation benefits only. Thus, he has argued, the debt is invalid because he did not concurrently receive benefits. The Veteran's Representative furthered these arguments in an Appellate Brief from July 2024.

By way of background, the Veteran had completed a number of periods of military drill day, whereby he received military drill pay. In the past, he has frequently waived his military drill pay in favor of VA compensation. For example, he submitted a VA Form 21-8951 Notice of Waiver of VA Compensation to Receive Military Pay in January 2019, waiving his 63 days of military drill pay for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. Another waiver Form was received in August 2019 for him having completed 45 drill days in FY 2018. He has also disputed - and requested a waiver for - these debts in the past. See August 2019 COWC Decision.

In general, there is a prohibition on the concurrent payment of VA disability compensation and active service pay. 38 U.S.C. § 5304 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700. Active service pay includes drill pay. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700. Reservists may waive their pension, compensation, or retirement pay for periods of field training, instruction, other duty, or drills. 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(iii). A waiver may include prospective periods and contain a right of recoupment for the days for which the reservist did not receive payment for duty by reason of failure to report for duty. Id.

The relevant FYs on appeal for the current overpayment are those from 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022.

In relevant part, the Veteran submitted a copy of a military Developmental Counseling Form from September 2018. In this Form, the Veteran informed a Department of the Army counselor that "as of October 1, 2018, until further notice, that he does not want to receive military pay for completing duties," and that he requested "retirement points only." The Veteran clearly stated his desire to forfeit military pay in favor of VA benefits. See DA Form 4856.

The Veteran was then sent a VA Form 8951, noting that VA received information that the Veteran completed 4 drill pay days in FY 2019. He was asked to return the form, electing to either waive VA compensation benefits or military drill pay. The Veteran did not return this form.

In December 2020, the Veteran was sent another VA Form 8951, noting his 15 drill pay days completed in FY 2020. The Veteran did not return this form.

In February 2022, the Veteran was sent another VA Form 8951, noting his 12 drill pay days in FY 2021. This Form was sent to the Veteran's spouse as his authorized payee. The Form was not returned.

In February 2023, the Veteran was sent another VA Form 8951, noting his 15 drill pay days in FY 2022. This Form was again sent to the Veteran's spouse as his authorized payee. The Form was not returned.

Following each point whereby the VA Forms 8951 were not returned, internal Award Print screens noted that debts were created, corresponding with the drill pay days completed. In order of FY from 2019-2022, the debts created were $458.28, $1,746.05, $1,415.00, and $1,873.10, respectively. These debts total $5,492.43. The Veteran was sent letters from the Debt Management Center noting the debts, and at times noting the increase in total debt. See July 2023 DMC letter.

The Veteran then submitted a VA Form 5655, Financial Status Report (FSR), through which he requested a waiver of recovery of the debt. The Veteran included income for himself and his spouse, monthly expenses, a list of his assets, and his installment contracts. Of note, the Veteran wrote in the final section of the FSR the following:

I am trying to prove that I have not received military pay while receiving VA compensation. I have constantly requested to be only paid in retirement points, while drilling in the National Guard. The only pay I should have received was my life insurance for my SGLI.

The Veteran's waiver claim was forwarded to the COWC in February 2024. Of note, the COWC determined that even though the waiver claim was for prior periods of overpayment, the claim would be considered timely for the debts generated for FY 2019-2022, as the Veteran had previously been declared incompetent to handle the disbursement of funds. See July 2018 Rating Decision.

The COWC then determined that the Veteran was at fault for the concurrent receipt of VA compensation and military drill pay, that he was therefore unjustly enriched, and that he did not face undue financial hardship if the debt were to be recovered. The Veteran's waiver claim was denied for the total indebtedness of $5,492.43.

In response, the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182, NOD. He wrote that he was appealing the wavier denial, but that he was also disputing the validity of the debt. The Veteran wrote that he had "specifically requested 'no pay' from my [National Guard] unit, because I received VA pay (retirement points only)." The Veteran continued that "drill pay was requested 'not' to be received for drill pay weekends." The Veteran argued that he had not received the military drill pay that VA has determined he received concurrently with VA compensation. He also requested a "full review of all drill pay activities," which the Board interprets as a request for an audit, for the relevant FYs in question.

The Veteran's claim was placed on the Direct Review docket and is now before the Board.

As an initial matter, the Board observes that the Veteran has directly challenged the validity of the debt, arguing that he did not receive military drill pay, as he has elected VA compensation instead. While the Veteran did not return the relevant VA Forms 21-8951 during FYs 2019-2022, there is evidence that the Veteran has previously sought to waive his military pay in favor of VA compensation in the past. The Board is also unable to assess whether or not the Veteran was actually paid drill pay during these periods, as that information is not immediately clear from the evidence available. Despite the Veteran's challenge, there has been no formal finding as to the validity of the debt, prior to the waiver Decision.

The Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has directed that appellate review by the Board on the Veteran's waiver claim must be deferred pending formal adjudication of the Veteran's challenge to the validity of the debt by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430, 437 (1991) ("when a Veteran raises the validity of the debt as part of a waiver application... it is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion to adjudicate the waiver application without first deciding a veteran's challenge to the lawfulness of the debt asserted against him or her"); VAOPGCPREC 6-98 (July 24, 1998) (holding that when a veteran challenges the validity of the debt and seeks waiver of the debt, the [Regional Office] must first fully review the debt's validity and, if the office believes the debt to be valid, prepare a written decision fully justifying the validity of the debt before referring the waiver request to the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC)). A debtor may dispute the amount or existence of a debt, which is a right that may be exercised separately from a request for waiver or at the same time. 38 C.F.R. § 1.911 (c)(1). Resolution of the creation issue must precede consideration of the waiver issue.

One of the effects of the AMA is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of immediately remanding them directly. Nevertheless, even under the AMA the Board still has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See Pub L. No. 115-55 section (2)(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Here, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error has taken place. Despite the Veteran's challenge, no formal finding as to the validity of the debt has occurred. Given the Veteran's specific claim - that he did not receive military drill pay - the RO should reach out to the relevant payment authorities at the Army National Guard to confirm whether or not the Veteran actually received military pay during FYs 2019-2022. The Veteran should be given an audit for those years as well, per his request, and then a formal finding regarding the validity of the debt must be given.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the relevant payment authority, including from those at the Army National Guard, to confirm whether or not the Veteran actually received military drill pay during FYs 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Any response received must be documented within the claims file.

2. Following Step 1, prepare for the Veteran an explanatory audit which notes, at the very least, the military drill pay, if any, that he is confirmed to have received, as well as his VA compensation benefits during FY 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. 

3. Following Steps 1-2, the RO must make a formal finding as to the validity of the overpayment created, as a result of the Veteran receiving military drill pay while concurrently receiving VA compensation pay during FYs 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. If any amount of the purported overpayment is determined to be valid, the Veteran should again be informed of any rights/obligations associated with the overpayment.

The RO is reminded that when a Veteran raises the validity of the debt as part of a waiver application, the issue regarding the challenge to the lawfulness of the debt asserted against the Veteran must first be decided. See Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430, 437 (1991).
