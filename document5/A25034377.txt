Entitlement to an effective date of July 5, 2005, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's child, J.L., is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's children, E.L. and D.L., is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's child, J.J.L., is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On July 5, 2005, the Veteran first notified the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of his stepchildren and child, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., J.M., and J.L., respectively.

2. As the Veteran notified VA of his stepchildren and child, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., J.M., and J.L., within one-year of a request from VA and subsequent filing to add them as dependents, the appropriate effective date is July 5, 2005, with payments beginning effective August 1, 2005. 

3. On October 18, 2013, the Veteran first notified the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) of his children, E.L., D.L., and J.J.L.

4. The Veteran did not provide proof of his children, E.L. and D.L.'s, existence within one year of the effective date given for the established 30 percent or more disability rating, nor did VA receive any claim, formal or informal, seeking entitlement to dependency benefits for these children prior to October 18, 2013.

5. The appropriate effective date for the addition of the Veteran's child, J.J.L., is October 18, 2013, the date of claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of July 5, 2005, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.31, 3.204, 3.205, 3.400, 3.401(b).

3. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's children, E.L. and D.L., have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.31, 3.204, 3.205, 3.400, 3.401(b). 

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's child, J.J.L., have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1115, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.31, 3.204, 3.205, 3.400, 3.401(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from April 1996 to April 1999 and from August 1999 to June 2005. 

In February 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ/Regional Office (RO)) issued a decision continuing the award for the Veteran's dependent stepchildren and children as its current rate.

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran requested the Direct Review. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notes that the evidentiary window based on the Veteran's selection is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the AOJ issued notice of the applicable decision. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to December 1, 2007, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M. 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to December 1, 2007, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's child, J.L.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's minor children, E.L. and D.L.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to October 18, 2013, for the additional dependency compensation for the Veteran's child, J.J.L.

The Veteran asserts that earlier effective dates for the additional dependency compensation for his stepchildren and children is warranted, this awarding him retroactive payments. 

Legal Criteria

A veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).

A "child" of the Veteran for VA benefits purposes is defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.57. A child must be "unmarried" and must be either (i) under the age of 18; (ii) have become permanently incapable of self-support before the age of 18; or (iii) be between the ages of 18 and 23 and pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution. 38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57(a)(1).

VA law establishes a stepchild is a legitimate or an illegitimate child of the veteran's spouse, and must be a member of the Veteran's household to be considered the Veteran's dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57(a)(1).

An award of additional compensation on account of dependents based on the establishment of a disability rating in the percentage evaluation specified by law for the purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating; but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of notification of such rating action. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b)(3).

Regarding additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating, provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award (the first day of the calendar month following the month of the award underlying the entitlement amount). 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for a dependent spouse or stepchild is the date of the marriage, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of a request from VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401. Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).

The "date of commencement of the veteran's award" is not defined in the regulation. However, if the word "award" has the same meaning as the phrase "combined rating," and if the word "commencement" has the same meaning as the phrase "effective date," then § 3.401(b)(3) is duplicative of § 3.401(b)(4), short of § 3.401(b)(3)'s qualifier "if evidence of the veteran's marriage is received within one year of being notified of such a rating." Because such a duplication would render § 3.401(b)(3)'s qualifier meaningless, the Board concludes that the meaning of "award" differs from that of "combined rating," and the meaning of "commencement" differs from that of "effective date." Therefore, the Board examines relevant VA regulations for guidance as to the meanings of "commencement" and "award," as used in § 3.401(b)(4). Notably, 38 C.F.R. § 3.31, titled "Commencement of the period of payment," provides that, regardless of VA regulations governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits may not commence prior to the first day of the calendar month following the month in which the award became effective. Based on the similarity of the terminology used in § 3.31 and § 3.401(b)(4), and given the relevance of the § 3.31 mandate to § 3.401(b), the Board concludes that the phrase "the date of commencement of the award" in § 3.401(b)(4) means the first day of the calendar month following the month of the award underlying the entitlement amount.

In Sharp v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 267, 276 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the effective date for additional compensation for dependents shall be the same date as the rating decision giving rise to such entitlement, irrespective of any previous grant of section 1115 benefits, if proof of a dependent is submitted within one year of notice of the rating action.  Although the Court held that there can be "multiple rating decisions that establish entitlement to additional dependency compensation," it still required that proof of dependent status be submitted within one year of notice of rating action. Id. 

For purposes of determining eligibility for benefits for a dependent spouse or child/stepchild, VA will accept a claimant's statements as proof of marriage, dissolution of a marriage, proof of a birth of a child, or death of a dependent, provided that the statement contains: the date (month and year) and place of the event (i.e. the place of birth); the full name and relationship of the other person to the claimant; where the claimant's dependent child does not reside with the claimant, the name and address of the person who has custody of the child; and the social security number of the other person. 38 U.S.C. § 5124; 38 C.F.R. § 3.204. Although written evidence serves as sufficient proof, however, other, additional proof is required under circumstances where the claimant does not reside within a state; the statement, on its face, raises questions of validity; there is conflicting evidence of record; or where there is a reasonable indication that there is fraud or a misrepresentation of the relationship in question. See McColley v. West, 13 Vet. App. 553, 557 (2000).

There is a presumption of regularity in the administrative process, and it is presumed that a claimant received proper notice by VA. See Boyd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 63, 71-72 (2014) (holding that under the presumption of regularity, if notice is sent to the claimant's last known address of record, it will be presumed that VA properly discharged its official duties). This presumption may only be rebutted with "clear evidence to the contrary." Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 309 (1992). See also Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994).

Analysis

In July 2005, the Veteran submitted a copy of his Marriage Certificate/License reflecting him and his current spouse, H.M., were married on September 9, 2001, along with his current spouse's birth certificate showing her maiden name of H.L.W.  He also submitted the social security cards and birth certificates of his stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., to whom his current spouse's maiden name of H.L.W. is shown as their mother; as well as the social security card and birth certificate of his child, J.L., which reflects the Veteran and his current spouse's maiden name of H.L.W. as his parents. 

In a September 2005 rating decision, the RO rated the Veteran's combined, total service-connected disabilities at 30 percent or greater, effective, June 3, 2005. He was notified of this rating action by letter on September 26, 2005, which was mailed to his then current mailing address of record. Information regarding the addition of his dependent spouse was included with the letter, as well as the decision that his stepchildren and child could not be added to his award due to the need for a copy of their birth certificates and a completed VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents. 

In October 2005, the Veteran submitted the requested VA Form 21-686c Declaration of Status of Dependents, requesting to add his stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., and child, J.L., to his award. Within the form, the Veteran provided their birthdays, social security numbers, place of birth, and name and address of person (their mother) having custody of the children. He also included a copy of his current spouse's divorce decree from her ex-husband. 

In October 2013, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-0538 Mandatory Status of Dependents, in which he included his stepchildren and child, as well as the additional children of J.J.L., E.L., and D.L. Within the form, the Veteran provided their birthdays, social security numbers, and place of birth. The stepchildren and child, J.L., were subsequently added to the Veteran's award, effective December 1, 2007; and his children, E.L., and D.L., were added to the award, effective October 18, 2013, with payments beginning effective November 1, 2013, the first day of the month following the effective date.

In November 2021, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-0538 Mandatory Status of Dependents, in which he requested addition of his child, J.J.L, to his award. Within the form, the Veteran provided the child's birthday, social security number, place of birth, and notated the child was his biological child. J.J.L. was subsequently added to the Veteran's award, effective November 21, 2021, with payments beginning effective December 1, 2021, the first day of the month following the effective date.

Having considered the pertinent evidence of record an earlier effective date for the addition of the Veteran's stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., and the addition of the Veteran's children, J.L. and J.J.L, is warranted. However, an earlier effective date for the addition of the Veteran's children, E.L., and D.L., is not warranted.

Per the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b), the effective date for additional compensation for a dependent will be the latest of the following dates: (1) the date of claim, if the claim is received within one year of the marriage or claim; (2) the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of a request from VA; (3) the date dependency arises; (4) the effective date of a qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such action; or (5) the date of commencement of a veteran's award. Pertinent to this claim, the Veteran and his current spouse were married on September 9, 2001, however, the Veteran did not file claim to add his stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., or children, J.L. J.J.L, E.L., and D.L., as dependents until October 5, 2005 and October 18, 2013, respectively. As this is not within one-year of the date of marriage, an effective date of September 9, 2001, is not possible. 

Nevertheless, as it pertains to the Veteran's stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., and child, J.L., the date notice was received of their existence was July 5, 2005, the date dependency arose was September 9, 2001, the effective date of the qualifying disability rating was June 3, 2005, and the date of commencement of the Veteran's qualifying award was July 1, 2005. Based on section 3.401(b), the effective date is the latest of these dates, which in this case would be July 5, 2005. As notice was received within one year of a request from VA, an earlier effective date of July 5, 2005, but no earlier, for the addition of the Veteran's stepchildren, A.M., D.M., A.J.M., and J.M., and child, J.L., is warranted. To this extent only, the claim is granted.

As it pertains to the Veteran's children, E.L., and D.L., the date notice was received of their existence was October 18, 2013, the date dependency arose was September 9, 2001, the effective date of the qualifying disability rating was June 3, 2005 (but not received within one year of proof of dependents), and the date of commencement of the Veteran's qualifying award was July 1, 2005. Based on section 3.401(b), the effective date is the latest of these dates, which in this case would be October 18, 2013, and therefore, an earlier effective date for the addition of the Veteran's children, E.L., and D.L., prior to this time is not possible in this case. To this extent only, the claim is denied.

Lastly, as it pertains to the Veteran's child, J.J.L, the date notice was received of this child's existence was October 18, 2013, the date dependency arose was September 9, 2001, the effective date of the qualifying disability rating was June 3, 2005 (but not received within one year of proof of dependents), and the date of commencement of the Veteran's qualifying award was July 1, 2005. Based on section 3.401(b), the effective date is the latest of these dates, which in this case would be October 18, 2013. Therefore, an earlier effective date of October 12, 2013, but no earlier, for the addition of the Veteran's child, J.J.L., is warranted. To this extent only, the claim is granted.
