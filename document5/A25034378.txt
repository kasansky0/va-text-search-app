ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 23, 2023 for the award of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome "fatigue" is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of June 23, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for fatigue in an August 2016 rating decision of his July 2015 claim. The Veteran timely submitted a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in September 2016, and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in December 2018. However, the Veteran did not perfect his appeal to the Board by timely submitting his VA Form 9. As a result, the decision is final.

2. The next correspondence that can be interpreted as a service connection claim for fatigue was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim on June 23, 2023.

3. The Veteran initially filed his claim for sinusitis in June 2010 and again in September 2016. Rating decisions were issued in response to these claims in February 2012 and December 2018, respectively. The Veteran did not appeal these decisions, nor was new and material evidence received within one year. Thus, these rating decisions became final.

4. The next correspondence that can be interpreted as a claim for service connection for sinusitis was received on June 23, 2023.

5. The Veteran's claim for sinusitis was received more than one year from the effective date of a liberalizing law or VA issue, which established a presumption of service connection for sinusitis in association with exposure to fine particulate matter for Gulf War veterans.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than June 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for fatigue are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of June 23, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114, 3.303, 3.317, 3.320, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 1976 to August 1999, with service in Southwest Asia. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from November 2023 (sinusitis) and December 2023 (fatigue) rating decisions from a VA AOJ. The Veteran timely appealed, submitting the VA Form 10182 in September 2024 and selecting the Direct Review docket. In the Direct Review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision on appeal for each issue. Accordingly, no additional evidence after the November 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions, respectively, may be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Of note, the Board honors the Veteran's request to clarify that his appeal route before the Board is the Direct Review. See June 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2024 BVA NOD Clarification Letter; September 2024 VA Form 10182.

Effective Dates

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

From March 24, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018); 79 Fed. Reg. 57,696 (Sept. 25, 2014).

After March 24, 2015, aside from submitting a formal claim, a Veteran may file an intent to file a claim via a saved electronic application, written intent on a prescribed intent to file a claim form, or oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. If any communication indicating a desire for benefits is not completed by one of these three options, then such communication is considered a request for an application form for benefits and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2018).

Prior to February 19, 2019, a final claim is one in which the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). A claimant must file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that notice of the determination is mailed to him or her. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. A decision will not become final if new and material evidence is submitted within one year of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

After the issuance of an SOC, an appellant must file a substantive appeal within 60 days from the date of the mailing of the SOC or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of the mailing for the decision being appealed, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.22, 19.52. The AOJ may close an appeal without notice to an appellant or their representative for failure to respond to a Statement of the Case (SOC) within the period allowed. 38 C.F.R. § 19.32.

A rating decision is final and binding as to the conclusions based on the evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a). A final and binding AOJ decision will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). Where the evidence establishes such an error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended, and it will have the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the same date as the reversed or amended decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 23, 2023 for the award of service connection for fatigue is denied.

The Veteran asserts that his fatigue should be awarded to when he first filed his original claim on July 20, 2015, due to inadequacies with the VA examinations. The record indicates, in affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, that he was diagnosed with, or at least presented symptoms of fatigue, as early as 2012. See September 2023 VA examination. A claim for fatigue was originally filed by the Veteran in July 2015 and denied in an August 2016 rating decision. The Veteran timely submitted his NOD in September 2016 and the SOC was issued in December 2018. However, the Veteran did not perfect his appeal to the Board by timely submitting his VA Form 9 and the August 2016 rating decision became final. As a result, regardless of whether the Veteran had fatigue at that time, the decision is final and an effective date prior to the August 2016 decision cannot be assigned. The Board notes that for purposes of determining whether a decision became final, VA will consider evidence actually received within one year of a decision, as well as evidence constructively received within that year. A Veteran's VA treatment records are considered constructively received as of the date that they are generated. See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020). However, no relevant VA treatment records were submitted within one year of the issuance of the September 2018 rating decision. Accordingly, based on the above, the August 2016 rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156(a)-(b), 20.302, 20.1103.

The Veteran did not communicate with VA again regarding his claim for fatigue until June 23, 2023; at which time he submitted his Supplemental Claim form. In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for fatigue, effective June 23, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's petition to reopen the claim. The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date; however, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.

An effective date for a reopened claim of entitlement to service connection can be no earlier than the date the request to reopen the claim was filed. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109, 3.156, 3.400(r).

The evidence does not reflect that a claim to reopen the Veteran's claim for fatigue was received between the December 2018 SOC and June 23, 2023, nor does the Veteran allege otherwise. Absent an earlier claim for service connection for fatigue, the Board concludes that the earliest effective date that is warranted is the currently assigned date of June 23, 2023, which is the earliest effective date allowed by law.

Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's claim, the Board is bound by the applicable statutes and regulations. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). There is no legal basis by which to assign an effective date earlier than June 23, 2023, for the grant of service connection for fatigue. The claim must therefore be DENIED.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection is warranted because the Veteran did not have an in-depth examination when he filed his original claim in 2015. Such arguments equate to a theory of equitable relief rather than a dispute of material law or facts. The Board is bound by the specific, relevant laws and regulations governing the assignment of effective dates for the award of compensation benefits, as summarized above. The Board lacks the authority to award an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection on an equitable basis.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of June 23, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is granted.

The Veteran was awarded service connection for sinusitis in a November 2023 rating decision with an effective date of June 23, 2023, based on the date VA received the Veteran's claim. The Veteran contends that his award date should go back to June 21, 2010, when he first filed his claim, due to inadequacies with the VA examinations.

Upon review of the record and applicable regulations, the Board agrees that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for sinusitis is warranted, however, the Board finds that an effective date of June 23, 2022, is appropriate for the reasons that follow.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. See also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

The Veteran initially submitted his claim for sinusitis in June 2010 and was denied in a February 2012 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year, to include any relevant VA treatment records under constructive receipt. Therefore, the February 2012 decision is final.

The next correspondence that can be interpreted as a claim for service connection for sinusitis was received in September 2016, ultimately culminating in a rating decision issued on December 2018. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year, to include any relevant VA treatment records under constructive receipt. Therefore, the September 2016 decision is final.

The next correspondence that can be interpreted as a claim for service connection for sinusitis was received in June 2023 in the Veteran's submission of his Supplemental Claim. The claim was then granted in a November 2023 rating decision, with an effective date of June 23, 2023.

However, the situation in this case is one where VA regulations do provide for an effective date earlier than receipt of the claim. Retroactive dates are allowed, to a certain extent, in cases where an award or increase of compensation is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law or VA issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). To be eligible for a retroactive payment under those provisions, the evidence must show that the claimant met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue, and that such eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim. Id. In such cases, the effective date of the award or increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a).

For a claimant to receive benefits dating back to the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue, the claim must be received within one year of the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(1). If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of the liberalizing VA law or VA issue, retroactive benefits of up to one year prior to the date of receipt of such request may be available if the claimant met all eligibility criteria on the effective date of the law change and that eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3). The rule regarding presumptive service connection for Gulf War veterans for asthma, rhinitis, and sinusitis, in association with exposure to fine particulate matter became effective August 5, 2021 and applies to all claims received by VA on or after August 5, 2021, and that were pending before VA, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 5, 2021. See 86 Fed. Reg. 42724 (August 5, 2021).

The November 2023 rating decision awarded presumptive service connection for sinusitis due to toxic exposure during service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. Thus, implicitly finding that the Veteran met eligibility criteria for the liberalizing rule implemented on August 5, 2021. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Here, the Veteran's claim was received on June 23, 2023, more than one year after the effective date of the liberalizing VA law or VA issue (August 5, 2021). The September 2023 VA examiner noted the Veteran's sinusitis diagnosis date to be in 1996. Thus, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3), retroactive benefits of up to one year prior to the date of receipt of such request are available as the Veteran met all eligibility criteria on the effective date of the law change and that eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim.

Therefore, the Board finds that an effective date of June 23, 2022 one year prior to the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim seeking service connection for sinusitis, is warranted for the award of service connection for sinusitis.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection is warranted because the Veteran did not have an in-depth examination when he filed his original claim in 2012. Such arguments equate to a theory of equitable relief rather than a dispute of material law or facts. The Board is bound by the specific, relevant laws and regulations governing the assignment of effective dates for the award of compensation benefits, as summarized above. The Board lacks the authority to award an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection on an equitable basis.

Consequently, entitlement to an effective date of June 23, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for sinusitis is GRANTED.
