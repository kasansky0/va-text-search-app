ORDER

Service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease (claimed as cervical spine pain) is denied.

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (claimed as mental health condition with anxiety and depression) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's cervical degenerative disc disease began during active service, manifested to a compensable degree within the first post-service year, or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and depression, was resolved by a June 2022 rating decision, which granted service connection for depressive disorder due to chronic pain with insomnia disorder and assigned a 50 percent disability rating, effective from February 4, 2021.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease have not been met.  38 U.S.C §§ 1131, 5107, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, .3.310.  

2. As there remains no justiciable case or controversy for consideration by the Board regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and depression, the criteria for dismissal have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1981 to September 1986.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2022 higher-level review of an April 2022 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The April 2022 rating decision denied service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease with invertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), anxiety, and depression.  The May 2022 higher-level review rating decision confirmed the denials of service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease with IVDS; and, anxiety.  

However, during the higher-level review of the Veteran's service connection claim for depression, a duty to assist error was identified and the claim was transferred to the supplement claim decision review option for additional development.

In a May 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran disagreed with the denial of service connection for anxiety and cervical degenerative disc disease with IVDS.  The Veteran also elected the Direct Review docket.

Following development regarding the claim of service connection for depression, the RO issued a June 2022 rating decision granting service connection for depressive disorder due to chronic pain with insomnia (an acquired psychiatric disorder), and assigned an initial 50 percent disability rating, effective from February 4, 2021.  As noted below, the Veteran's anxiety is considered in the disability rating assigned for the service-connected psychiatric disorder

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Service connection may also be granted when a disease is diagnosed after discharge where all of the evidence shows that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Moreover, lay statements can be competent and sufficient to establish a condition that existed prior to a formal diagnosis, if the lay statements describe symptoms that are supported by a medical professional who later diagnoses a disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d at 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Service connection for certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, may be established based upon a legal "presumption" by showing that the disease manifested to the necessary degree during the requisite presumptive period.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  The option of establishing service connection through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology rather than through a finding of nexus is specifically limited to the chronic disabilities listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Even when a veteran is not entitled to the presumption of service connection, he or she may nonetheless establish service connection based with proof of actual direct causation.  See generally Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (all that is needed is a "but for" causation or aggravation to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

In determining whether service connection may be granted, a review of the entire evidence of record is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Where there is an "approximate balance" of positive and negative evidence to support a claim, the claimant will receive the "benefit of the doubt".  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

1. Entitlement to service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease (claimed as cervical spine pain)

The Veteran seeks service connection for a cervical spine disability, which he asserts is secondary to his service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine because pain radiates from his back to his neck, and he has decreased range of motion (ROM) in his neck.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  The Veteran further asserts that he is entitled to service connection for a cervical spine disability on a direct basis because his VA treatment records show that he experienced chronic cervical spine pain since his active-duty service.  See May 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review.  

As an initial matter, the AOJ made a favorable finding in the May 2022 decision on appeal that, based on a March 2022 VA medical examination report, the Veteran was diagnosed with cervical degenerative disc disease with IVDS, which manifested to a compensable degree following service.  The AOJ also found that the Veteran is service connected for degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and that the Veteran meets the minimum requirements for consideration of service connection on a presumptive basis as degenerative disc disease (arthritis) is a chronic disease that may be presumptively linked to active service.  The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings absent evidence of a clear and unmistakable error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  Indeed, the Veteran's personnel records confirms he served more than 90 days from June 1981 to September 1986.  See Department of Defense (DD) Form 214.  However, the March 2022 VA medical examination report shows the Veteran was diagnosed with "degenerative disc disease other than invertebral disc syndrome (IVDS)" (emphasis added).  Nevertheless, as it is undisputed that the Veteran has a current cervical spine disability, the remaining questions are whether the Veteran's cervical spine disability began during service, manifested to a compensable degree within one year following service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records reveals multiple complaints for low back pain in-service, and even a diagnosis of low back strain.  See November 1983 Physical Therapy Consultation; see also November 1984 separation examination (showing the Veteran had "recurrent back pain [in the] lumbosacral area since 1983").  However, the Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints of cervical spine pain, neck pain, or upper back pain.  Moreover, while the Veteran reported low back pain on his separation examination, he did not report cervical spine pain or neck pain on his Report of Medical History, and none was shown on his separation examination.  Additionally, the Veteran's post-service medical records do not contain any complaints or treatment for cervical spine pain until March 2000.  See March 2000 VA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) report.  

The Veteran initially filed a claim of service connection for a low back disability in May 2005; and, although the Veteran's treatment records show that he reported neck and back pain in March 2000, his May 2005 claim of service connection did not include a claim of service connection for neck pain.  Thus, the Veteran's current assertion that he has experienced neck/cervical spine pain since service is inconsistent with the totality of the other evidence of record.  In essence, if the Veteran had neck pain since service, then it is reasonable to infer that there would be some evidence of this, at least as early as 2000 given the MRI report, the report of neck pain in 2000, and the Veteran's report of low back pain with a claim of service connection for low back pain.  However, the Veteran did not include a claim of service connection for neck pain when he claimed service connection for low back pain in 2005, and similarly, did not include a claim of service connection for neck pain or a cervical spine disability when he claimed service connection for a lumbar spine disability and a skin rash in 2008.  Furthermore, an August 2009 VA back examination indicates that there were no objective abnormalities of the cervical sacrospinalis and no ankylosis of the cervical spine at that time.  

Although the Veteran asserts that he experienced chronic cervical spine pain since active duty, he is not competent to know whether the cervical spine pain he purportedly experienced in service was a manifestation of his current cervical degenerative disc disease as such a determination is medically complex, requiring interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing such that it is outside the competence of the Veteran, who has not been shown to possess the medical training or credentials to make such determinations.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Curiously, it wasn't until the Veteran filed his May 2022 higher-level review request, more than 36 years after service, that he asserted his cervical spine pain had been chronic since active duty.  Prior to May 2022, the Veteran reported that his neck pain began in April 2011, when he awoke from sleep with sharp pain in his cervical area that he rated as an 8 to 9 out of 10 on the pain appraisal scale (PAS).  See July 2011 VA neurosurgery note.  An April 2011 MRI confirmed the Veteran had C5-C6 right lateral disc herniation with cord compression and compromise of the right C6 nerve root as well as C6-C7 disc bulging with mild stenosis.  Similarly, during the March 2022 VA medical examination, the Veteran reported his cervical spine disability symptoms began more than two decades after service (in 2010) when he "woke up with severe neck pain."  Although the March 2022 VA examination report indicates the Veteran's cervical spine disability symptoms began in 2010, it is clear from the evidence of record that the initiating incident of severe neck pain, to which the Veteran referred during the March 2022 VA medical examination, is the same episode of severe neck pain that is discussed in the July 2011 VA neurosurgery note.  Thus, while the Veteran is competent to report having neck pain since service, as that is capable of lay observation, his assertion is not supported by, and is inconsistent with, his prior competent lay statements that were made to medical professionals (the July 2011 VA neurosurgeon and the March 2022 VA medical examiner) regarding the onset of his cervical spine pain.  As such, the Veteran's statements that his neck pain began in 2010 or 2011 as a sharp pain that woke him from his sleep are more persuasive than the assertion that his neck pain was chronic since service.  Furthermore, the Veteran's reports to the July 2011 VA neurosurgeon are extremely persuasive in that those statements were made while seeking medical care and are supported by contemporaneous medical evidence in the form of the April 2011 private MRI report.  

As noted above, post-service medical records do not document any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a cervical spine disability until March 2000 when the Veteran had an MRI of his cervical spine due to reported neck and back pain.  Although the Veteran has reported severe pain from 2011, the earlier reports of neck pain in 2000 still do not support the Veteran's later reports of neck pain since service discharge in 1986.  

In March 2000, the MRI showed early degenerative changes in the Veteran's cervical spine (minimal degrative disc space narrowing seen at the lower level of the C6-C7 as well as early uncinate spurring).  In the absence of any prior competent medical evidence of record, the March 2000 VA MRI report demonstrates that the initial development or manifestations of the Veteran's cervical spine disability occurred well beyond the one-year presumptive period after discharge from active service.  Accordingly, service connection for arthritis as a chronic disease under 38 U.S.C. § 1112 and 38 C.F.R. §3.307, based on presumed in-service incurrence, is not warranted.

Additionally, for the reasons previously set forth, the evidence of record also does not establish that the Veteran had continuity of symptoms after service such that service connection may be awarded under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  Because the service treatment records do not contain any manifestations sufficient to identify the currently diagnosed cervical spine disability or sufficient observation to establish any upper back or neck symptom chronicity during service, and because chronicity in service is not demonstrated in the service treatment records, a showing of continuity of symptoms after service is required to support the present claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  But for the Veteran's unpersuasive assertion that he has experienced cervical spine pain since active duty, the record does not contain any contemporaneous evidence of continuity of symptoms after the Veteran's military discharge to support the claim.  Moreover, there is no evidence, medical or otherwise, to show that a cervical spine disability existed, let alone was present on a chronic basis, until more than a decade following the Veteran's active duty.  As such, with regard to establishing service connection based on chronicity and continuity of symptomatology under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), the evidence does not demonstrate that the current cervical spine disability had its onset during the Veteran's active service or manifested within one year after separation.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d), service connection may still be granted on a direct basis if the evidence shows that the claimed disability, which was first diagnosed more than a year after active service, is etiologically related to a disease, injury, or event in service.  Based on the evidence of record during the period on appeal, the Veteran's current cervical spine disability is not related to a disease, injury, or event in service.  As noted above, during the period on appeal, the Veteran asserted that his current cervical spine disability was due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also March 2022 VA medical examination report.  However, after the record closed in April 2022, the Veteran asserted that his cervical spine pain began in service and that he experienced ongoing symptoms since service.  See May 2022 higher-level review request.  While the Veteran may believe that his cervical spine disability had its onset in service, his opinion is not competent in this regard given the question of etiology is medically complex, and the Veteran has not been shown to possess the necessary competence, medical training, or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Additionally, the Veteran's assertion that his cervical spine pain had its onset during his active duty is unsupported by the objective medical evidence of record, which does not contain any complaints or treatment for cervical spine pain until March 2000; and even then, there is no indication in the record that the Veteran asserted that neck pain at that time had been continuous since service.  Furthermore, as previously discussed, the Veteran's assertion that his cervical spine pain was chronic since service is unpersuasive as it is inconsistent with his prior competent and credible statements that his neck pain began in 2011 as a sharp pain that woke him from his sleep.  See July 2011 VA neurosurgeon note; see also March 2022 VA medical examination report.  For all the foregoing reasons, the Veteran's statements as to the in-service onset of his neck pain are not credible.  

Although the Veteran underwent a VA medical examination in March 2022 in connection with his claim, a VA medical opinion was not obtained to address the question of whether the Veteran's current cervical spine disability was etiologically related to his active service because there is no competent and credible evidence indicating that the Veteran experienced any cervical spine pain during active duty, and there is no competent evidence showing any relationship between the Veteran's current symptoms and his active service, during the period on appeal.  Accordingly, even the low threshold under McLendon v. Nicholson has not been met here and VA's duty to provide a medical opinion regarding direct service connection has not been triggered.  20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 3.326.  Thus, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's current cervical spine disability had its onset during or is otherwise related to his active service.  

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's current cervical spine disability was caused or aggravated by his service-connected lumbar spine disability.  The March 2022 VA examiner addressed this question, opining that the Veteran's currently diagnosed cervical degenerative disc disease was less likely than not caused by or due to the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine.  As a rationale, the VA examiner explained that two joints may share properties, but "one joint's disease does not 'spread' to another [joint] or cause damage to it."  Stated another way, the VA examiner explained that "arthritis in one joint does not cause arthritis in another joint."  The VA examiner also explained that medical literature did substantiate that lumbar degenerative disc disease could cause cervical degenerative disc disease.  See April 2022 VA medical opinion report.

The April 2022 opinion is probative because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions with supporting data.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  As such, the April 2022 VA medical opinion is entitled to significant probative weight.  Given the April 2022 VA medical opinion is the only competent medical nexus evidence of record and there is no other competent medical evidence that contradicts or could otherwise diminish the probative value of the April 2022 VA medical opinion, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's current cervical degenerative disc disease was caused or aggravated by his service-connected lumbar degenerative disc disease.  Additionally, the competent and probative evidence of record also does not show that the Veteran's cervical spine disability began during active service, manifested to a compensable degree within the first post-service year, or is otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.  Accordingly, service connection for cervical degenerative disc disease is not warranted and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (claimed as mental health condition with anxiety and depression)

The Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and depression.  As indicated above, a June 2022 rating decision granted service connection for depressive disorder due to chronic pain with insomnia disorder and assigned a 50 percent disability, effective from February 4, 2021, due to symptoms including, but not limited to, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, and depressed mood.  In his August 2022 Appellate Brief, the Veteran asserts that the present claim for service connection for anxiety was improperly denied as VA had a pre-decisional duty to provide him with a psychiatric examination in connection with his service connection claim for anxiety.  The Veteran also asserts that his anxiety may be secondary to his depressive disorder and that the symptoms of his anxiety disorder may warrant a disability rating in excess of 50 percent.  

As an initial matter, the AOJ made a favorable finding in the May 2022 decision on appeal that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability because VA treatment records show a history of unspecified anxiety disorder.  See, e.g., August 2021 VA mental health note.  As the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable finding, it is undisputed that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  

Given the Veteran's diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder, he may have been entitled to a VA psychiatric examination prior to the May 2022 decision on appeal.  Nevertheless, it is apparent from the Veteran's August 2022 Appellate Brief and the June 2022 rating decision that the Veteran was ultimately provided with a VA psychiatric examination as well as a VA opinion in June 2022, following which service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder was granted.  Thus, any pre-decisional duty to assist error of failing to provide the Veteran with a VA psychiatric examination was cured when the Veteran's March 2022 claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (to include anxiety and depression) was granted in full in the June 2022 rating decision.  In general, only one rating is available for psychiatric symptoms under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  Here, there is no indication that any symptoms of the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder would be distinguishable from the symptoms of the service-connected depressive disorder due to chronic pain with insomnia disorder, as the AOJ assigned a 50 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder due to symptoms including anxiety.  

Based on the foregoing, the Veteran no longer has an issue on appeal regarding service-connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include anxiety and depression (claimed as mental health condition with anxiety and depression).  There is no longer any justiciable case or controversy as to the claim because the matter has been resolved favorably by the June 2022 AOJ decision.  The Veteran has been granted the relief sought (service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include anxiety and depression), and there remains no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Thus, as the matter has been decided, it is res judicata and cannot be adjudicated by the Board on the same basis.  Accordingly, there is no legal justification to warrant adjudication at this time.  38 U.S.C § 7104.

As there is no justiciable case or controversy regarding the acquired psychiatric disorder issue currently before the Board, the appeal in this matter must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104; see, e.g., Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 225 (U.S. 2006); Bond v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 376, 377 (1992) (when the relief sought has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is to dismiss that matter as moot).

Finally, the dismissal of this appeal is not prejudicial to the Veteran.  It is emphasized that the sole inquiry here pertained to service connection, and not to the disability rating or effective date that was assigned by the June 2022 rating decision.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that downstream elements, such as the initial rating and effective date, are not part of an appeal of a service connection denial).  The June 2022 VA decision is not on appeal, and if the Veteran wishes to challenge the assigned effective date of February 4, 2021, or the 50 percent disability rating, he may select one of the available review options, notice of which is provided with the present decision.
