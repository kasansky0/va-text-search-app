REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1989 to July 1995.  The DD Form 214 reflects a military occupational specialty (MOS) as a field medical service technician, with completion of Naval Hospital Corpsman Class A School and Field Medical Service School.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 2023 and November 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The rating decisions considered the evidence of record on those dates.  The Veteran timely appealed these decisions to the Board by requesting the AMA Direct Review docket for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the AMA decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) made binding favorable findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Duties to Notify and Assist

The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA) and implementing regulations impose obligations on VA to provide claimants with notice and assistance.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159, 3.326(a).

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Veteran declined a Board hearing.

The Veteran in this case has not referred to any deficiencies in either the duties to notify or assist; therefore, the Board may proceed to the merits of the claim.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015, cert denied, U.S.C. Oct. 3, 2016) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board....to search the record and address procedural arguments when the [appellant] fails to raise them before the Board"); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to an appellant's failure to raise a duty to assist argument before the Board).

The Board has reviewed all of the evidence in the Veteran's claims file.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no requirement that the evidence submitted by the Veteran or obtained on his behalf be discussed in detail.  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) and Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-130 (2000).

Service Connection

To establish service connection a Veteran must generally show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "Chronic."  When the disease identity is established (leprosy, tuberculosis, multiple sclerosis, etc.), there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity.  Continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service (or in the presumptive period) is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).  

We note that pain as organic disease of the nervous system and arthritis are chronic diseases, and as such, additional presumptive theories of entitlement are relevant in addition to direct service connection.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b), service connection may be established by demonstrating continuity of symptomatology.  Continuity may be established if a claimant can demonstrate (1) that a condition was "noted" during service; (2) evidence of post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology.  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b) only apply to diseases recognized by VA as "chronic."  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.309(a).  Chronic diseases that become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of termination of active duty may be presumed to have been incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Lay evidence cannot be determined not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  However, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence can be considered and weighed against a Veteran's lay statements.  Id.  The Board, as fact finder, is obligated to, and fully justified in, determining whether lay evidence is credible in and of itself, i.e., because of possible bias, conflicting statements, etc.  Id.  Further, a negative inference may be drawn from the absence of complaints for an extended period.  See Maxson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 453, 459 (1999), aff'd sub nom.  Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Board incorporates its discussion from the section above by reference.

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).  VA regulations do not preclude service connection for a hearing loss which first met VA's definition of disability after service.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).  In addition to dictating objective test results, a VA audiologist must fully describe the functional effects caused by a hearing disability in his or her final report.  Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447, 455 (2007).

By way of background, the Service Treatment Records (STRs) include an April 1995 Report of Medical Examination from separation.  It disclosed a clinically normal evaluation of the ears - general, ear drums, and neurologic system.  In the contemporaneous Report of Medical History the Veteran denied ear, nose, or throat trouble and hearing loss.

Next, the Veteran was afforded a December 2022 VA hearing loss conditions examination with Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) and medical opinion.  The VA examiner identified recurrent tinnitus.  The VA examiner described the onset, "The date of onset of tinnitus is 1991. The circumstance of onset of tinnitus is:  Veteran stated that he began to experience tinnitus after exposure to loud noise while in the military. The reported tinnitus is intermittent. The side(s) affected:  Bilateral. Frequency and duration:  10 times per day, lasting 20 seconds.  Tinnitus has not progressed since onset."  

Nevertheless, the VA examiner reached a negative nexus opinion.  The rationale reads, "Veteran stated that he served in the military as a corpsman/medic.  He was exposed to gunfire, explosions, aircraft, generators, heavy equipment and vehicle noise.  He worked post service as a stock clerk for 1 year and in security for 2 years.  Veteran stated that he began to experience tinnitus in 1991 after exposure to loud noise while in the military.  However, no records were found that indicate complaints of or treatment for tinnitus while in service.  Medical records do not support the Veteran's claim of tinnitus."  The Board observes that the absence of complaints or treatment is not necessarily dispositive of no impairment.  

Later, in the March 2023 rating decision, the RO favorably found, "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your most recent VA examination dated December22, 2022 shows you have a diagnosis of tinnitus."  There was still no nexus to service.

Ongoing VA treatment records are substantially the same.  

The Veteran essentially contends that he was exposed to hazardous noise while serving in constant contact to loud noises, with no hazardous noise exposure after separation.  He continues to assert that he is entitled to service connection for tinnitus.  

The Veteran is competent to provide evidence of that which he experiences, including a history of noise exposure as part of his duties.  He is competent to report exposure to ammunition and heavy equipment during service.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  The Veteran is competent to report when he first noticed reduced hearing acuity and ringing in his ears following events while still in service.  The Veteran is competent to relate a current diagnostic impression of tinnitus.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) (noting that lay testimony may establish the presence of tinnitus because ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation).  He is competent to report an onset following exposure to gunfire, explosions, aircraft, generators, and heavy equipment.  

Here, the Veteran has some medical training and competently and credibly alleges tinnitus since events in service.  On the other hand, there is a negative VA examination.  Although the VA examiner's rationale is based on a lack of complaints or treatment, such are not necessarily required as criteria for service connection.  In other words, the Veteran could have simply avoided treatment for tinnitus after service.  He reportedly worked as a stock clerk after separation.  Drawing all inferences in favor of the Veteran, the Board does not have a basis upon which to disprove the Veteran's lay contentions. 

At the very least, the competent, credible, and probative lay and medical evidence that supports the claim that the Veteran's tinnitus was manifest in service is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence standing against it.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that it is approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's tinnitus was incurred in service.  In reaching this decision, the Board has favorably weighed the Veteran's report of a continuous ringing noise in his ears.  See Charles, supra.  He has had tinnitus continuously since service.  We note the constancy of the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus throughout the appeal period.  The Veteran is therefore entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

2. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability, claimed as lumbosacral strain

3. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability, claimed as degenerative arthritis of the back

The Board incorporates its discussion from the sections above by reference.

By way of background, the Report of Medical Examination from April 1995 from separation disclosed a clinically normal evaluation of the spine, other musculoskeletal system and neurologic system.  In the contemporaneous Report of Medical History, the Veteran described his health as "excellent."  He denied arthritis, rheumatism, or bursitis, recurrent back pain, and head injury.  

Years later, the Veteran filed the instant service connection claims.  On the December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, the Veteran reported that his low back condition was caused by an in-service event, injury or exposure.  He elaborated that it was caused by carrying heavy packs on military hikes.  In the September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, the Veteran reported that his injury was caused by carrying heavy packs filled with military equipment while on military hikes while at Camp Lejeune, N.C.  

Next, the Veteran was afforded a December 2022 VA back conditions examination with Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) and medical opinion.  The VA examiner elicited a lay history from the Veteran, reviewed the entire claims file, and performed a physical examination.  The VA examiner diagnosed lumbosacral strain.  The VA examiner documented the Veteran's reports of an onset in 1992 surrounding hiking with heavy packs.  

Next, the VA examiner reached a negative nexus opinion in box 3B.  The VA examiner reasoned, "After reviewing medical records dated 05/13/1991 06/20/1991 and performing a physical exam for veteran in service  04/10/1989-07/06/1995, it is less likely than not that the veteran's Lumbosacral Strain is related to military service. There are no medical records showing diagnosis, treatment for the Lumbosacral Strain while the veteran was still in service. A nexus cannot be established."  This gives short shrift to the lay evidence from the Veteran.

The following year, the Veteran was afforded another November 2023 VA back conditions examination.  In this instance, the VA examiner did not find any back disability.  The related medical opinion shows a negative indication in box 3B.  The rationale reads, "Veteran served active duty in the Navy Gulf War from 04/09/1989 to 07/05/1995. Per C file, veteran complained of low back pain in 1990. Veterans condition was acute and resolved. C file silent for any other diagnosis, treatment, complaint or care for low back condition. Chronicity of diagnosis, treatment, complaint or care for any other low back condition. Objective exam is NORMAL. Subjective findings do not warrant any diagnosis. No plausible nexus can be established between veterans claimed condition of degenerative arthritis-back and the injury caused due to carry heavy back packs filled with military equipment on military hikes and vigorous training while on tour of duty in    Camp Lejeune, NC. during service.  A nexus is NOT established."

Ongoing VA treatment records include problem lists with diagnosed low back pain, although no onset date.  

The March 2023 rating decision favorably found, "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your most recent VA examination dated December 22, 2022 shows you have a diagnosis of lumbosacral strain."

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a back disability, claimed as lumbosacral strain and a back disability, claimed as degenerative arthritis of the back.

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  In this case, the Veteran has medical expertise.  A layperson is competent to provide "evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience."  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  "Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person."  See id.  A layperson is also competent to report on the onset and continuity of their current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  The Veteran is competent to provide evidence of that which he experiences, including his symptomatology and medical history.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran is competent to relate what she has been told by a professional.  

For these issues on appeal, the most probative evidence is the competent and credible lay statements of back pain provided by the Veteran based on his expertise as a field medical service technician.  

First, the RO already accepted a current diagnosis of diagnosed back disability in the form of lumbosacral strain.  The Veteran competently and credibly explained, using his medical expertise, that he experienced painful back impairment since long hikes with heavy gear in service in 1992.  The Board notes the constancy of the Veteran's reports across the appeal period.  Essentially, the Veteran has endorsed continuity of symptomatology, including painful impairment of the back since events in service.  In this regard, the law now provides that evidence of pain alone which results in functional impairment, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, can constitute a disability.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  The RO has since favorably accepted the remote, formal diagnosis of lumbosacral strain.

On the other hand, there are negative nexus opinions from the VA examiners.  To the extent the November 2023 VA back examination shows no current disability, the RO already accepted diagnosed lumbosacral strain.  The Board is bound by the favorable findings.  

Second, the VA examiners gave short shrift to the competent and credible statements from the Veteran as a medical professional.  These limit their probative value to only moderate probative weight.  The rationales based on the absence of medical records, especially when there is competent lay evidence, are not the same as a clinically normal examination.  The lack of reporting for treatment for the back does not necessarily preclude self-treatment.  The limited reasons and bases diminish the probative weight of the VA medical opinions for the back.  

To remand to resolve the diagnostic inconsistency would at best lend additional evidence to the current lumbsacral strain disability favorably found in the March 2023 rating decision.  At worst it could develop negative evidence against the appeals.  

At the very least, the competent, credible, and probative lay and medical evidence that supports the claim that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain was manifest in service is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence standing against it.  See Lynch v. McDonough, No. 20-2067 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain disability was incurred in service.  He has experienced painful back impairment since service, eventually diagnosed as lumbosacral strain.  We note the constancy of the Veteran's reports throughout the appeal period.  The Veteran is therefore entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Therefore, service connection for a lumbosacral strain disability is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Turning to the separate issue on appeal of a back disability claimed as arthritis, this was adjudicated by the RO in a November 2023 rating decision after the granted claim above.  Here, any diagnosed back impairment is attributable to the now-service-connected lumbosacral strain disability.  Additionally, for service connection purposes, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  There is no other diagnosed chronic back disability or the characteristic manifestations necessary to identify arthritis as determined by clinicians.  Once again, the most probative evidence is the VA examination results.  Even assuming there was separate back disability claimed as arthritis, although we do not concede this, there is still no nexus to service.  Therefore, service connection for the separate issue of a back disability claimed as arthritis is denied.

The Board incorporates its discussion from the sections above by reference.

By way of background, the Report of Medical Examination from April 1995 from separation disclosed a clinically normal evaluation of the upper extremities, feet, lower extremities, spine, other musculoskeletal system, and neurologic system.  In the contemporaneous Report of Medical History, the Veteran wrote "Excellent Health No Meds."  The Veteran denied arthritis, rheumatism or bursitis, lameness, painful or "trick" shoulder or elbow, trick or locked knee, and head injury.  He endorsed foot trouble and venereal disease.

After filing the instant service connection claims, the Veteran was afforded a series of December 2022 and November 2023 VA examinations with Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) and medical opinions.  The VA examiners elicited a lay history from the Veteran, reviewed the entire claims file, and performed a physical examination.  The VA examiner reached a series of negative nexus opinions in box 3B.  The opinion and results for each disability are as follow:

No diagnosis for degenerative arthritis-neck warranted on the day of the exam. Veterans claimed condition of degenerative arthritis-neck is less likely than not incurred in or caused by (the) Injury was caused due to carrying heavy back packs filled with military equipment on military hikes while on tour of duty in Camp Lejeune, NC. During service.

No diagnosis of degenerative arthritis -left and right shoulders warranted on the day of the exam. Veterans claimed condition of degenerative arthritis -left and right shoulders is less likely than not incurred in or caused by (the) Injury caused due to carrying heavy back packs filled with military equipment on military hikes while on tour of duty in Camp Lejeune, NC. during service.

No diagnosis for left knee degenerative arthritis warranted on the day of the exam. Veterans claimed condition of right knee degenerative arthritis is less likely than not incurred in or caused by (the) Injuries was caused due carrying heavy back packs filled with military equipment on military hikes while on tour of duty in Camp Lejeune, NC. during service.

After reviewing medical records dated 05/13/1991 06/20/1991 and performing a physical exam for veteran in service 04/10/1989-07/06/1995, it is less likely than not that the veteran's Left Ankle Strain is related to military service. There are no medical records showing diagnosis, treatment for the Left Ankle Strain while the veteran was still in service. A nexus cannot be established.

No diagnosis for degenerative arthritis-left and right ankles warranted on the day of the exam. Veterans claimed condition of degenerative arthritis-left and right ankles is    less likely than not incurred in or caused by (the) Injuries was caused while carrying heavy back packs filled with military equipment on military hikes while on tour of duty in Camp Lejeune, NC. during service.

Additional claimed bilateral disability opinions are substantially the same.  The VA examiner provided detailed reasons and bases for each claimed disability citing evidence in the claims file.

Next, the March 2023 rating decision in part granted service connection for right ankle strain, claimed as a musculoskeletal disability.  This represented a complete grant of that benefit sought on appeal.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993).

Later, the November 2023 rating decision reflects, "Your service treatment records do not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for this condition."

The following month, the December 2023 lists the issues on appeal, but does not feature any argument or identified evidence of current disability to contract these findings.  There was also still no nexus.

Ongoing treatment records are substantially the same. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for disabilities of the neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, left knee, left wrist, right wrist, left ankle, right ankle, left foot, and right foot.

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to provide "evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience."  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).  "Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person."  See id.  A layperson is also competent to report on the onset and continuity of their current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  The Veteran is competent to provide evidence of that which he experiences, including his symptomatology and medical history.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran is competent to relate what he has been told by a professional.  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary).  In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim.  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

The most probative evidence is the VA examination results.  The VA examiners performed physical examinations and considered the Veteran's lay evidence.  To the extent the Veteran has medical expertise, his findings are outweighed by the weight of the VA examination results grounded in medical reasons and bases.  The more recent November 2023 VA examination clarifies there is no current left ankle impairment, and the right ankle is already-service-connected.  The Veteran has not raised any specific objections to the VA examination results.

Here, the Board finds the lack of objective medical evidence as to the existence and diagnosis for any chronic neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, left knee, left wrist, right wrist, left ankle, right ankle, left foot, and right foot disability to be highly probative.  The most probative evidence is the contemporaneous treatment records, including the Report of Medical Examination from separation.  The examination disclosed a clinically normal evaluation of the upper extremities, feet, lower extremities, spine, other musculoskeletal system, and neurologic system.  In addition, there is a history in the VA treatment records of drug abuse.  

In reaching this decision, the Board considered a change in the law not long before the rating decision on appeal.  Saunders clarified that evidence of pain alone which results in functional impairment, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, can constitute a disability.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) found that the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability."  Saunders was in the context of the musculoskeletal system, though it does not explicitly hold that it is limited to such circumstances.  

Since Saunders, in Wait v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) addressed the question of what is necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that his or her pain or other symptoms cause "functional impairment of earning capacity," and therefore meet the current disability requirement under Saunders.  Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8, 2020 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1609, 2020 WL 5200689.  The CAVC held that, to meet the current disability requirement under Saunders, "there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person."  The CAVC clarified that the Board must make the factual determination whether the appellant's manifestations rise to the level of a functional impairment in earning capacity.  Notably, Saunders does not eliminate the need for underlying pathology, disease, or injury (also sometimes called a diagnosis). 

Here, the weight of the evidence does not suggest characteristic manifestations of a neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, left knee, left wrist, right wrist, left ankle, right ankle, left foot, and right foot disability.  This is consistent with the findings of the separation examination, to which the Board assigns the most probative weight.  Put simply, there was no impairment due to the claimed pain alone as is addressed by Saunders.  Any ankle impairment from service, other than for the right ankle, was acute, transitory, and resolved without residuals before separation.  It follows that the weight of the evidence is against any indication of a relationship to service.  Therefore, even after considering Saunders, service connection for these disabilities is not warranted. 

In reaching this decision, the Board notes that the Veteran has not identified any other probative evidence demonstrating that service connection is warranted for the claimed disabilities.  The Veteran declined a hearing and submitted remote lay assertions that he experienced such symptoms in service.  Such allegations are outweighed by the contemporaneous medical records.  The Board finds the lack of objective medical evidence as to the existence and diagnosis for the claimed disabilities to be highly probative.  Even assuming recent pathology were identified, though we do not concede this, there is still no link to service (nexus).  The Veteran has been afforded a series of VA examinations to substantiate his claims.  There is no doubt to resolve.  Accordingly, service connection for neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, left knee, left wrist, right wrist, left ankle, right ankle, left foot, and right foot disabilities is not warranted.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  

The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

In reaching these conclusions, the evidence persuasively stands against finding in favor of the claims in that it is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" to the evidence that supports the claims.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding "[E]vidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.")  Although the rule does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise, there is still no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  Therefore, the service connection claims are denied.
