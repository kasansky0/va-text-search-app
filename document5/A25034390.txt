ORDER

A higher level of special monthly compensation than special monthly compensation based on anatomical loss of a creative organ is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has not suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of a foot, or hand, or both buttocks, or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, has suffered complete organic aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech, or deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction, or, in the case of a woman veteran, has suffered the anatomical loss of 25 percent or more of tissue from a single breast or both breasts in combination (including loss by mastectomy or partial mastectomy) or has received radiation treatment of breast tissue.  He is not housebound or in need of regular aid and attendance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a higher level of special monthly compensation than special monthly compensation based on anatomical loss of a creative organ have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1997 to November 2001.  

The December 2023 rating decision continued the level of special monthly compensation at the current rate.  The modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to this decision.  

The December 2023 rating decision arose from an August 2023 Supplemental Claim.  In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the December 2023 rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board, including statements submitted with the July 2024 VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran submitted evidence after the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for testicular cancer at a noncompensable rate.  The rating decision stated that the final evaluation for this disability was deferred.  To date, the issue of the final evaluation is still pending and unadjudicated.  The Board does not have the issue of the evaluation for testicular cancer before it because it was not decided in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Veteran may contact the agency of original jurisdiction to request a status of the final adjudication of the rating for testicular cancer as noted in the May 2023 rating decision.

A higher level of special monthly compensation than special monthly compensation based on anatomical loss of a creative organ.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a higher level of special monthly compensation (SMC) because he meets the criteria for a higher evaluation due to urinary frequency.

The Veteran has been awarded special monthly compensation for anatomical loss of a creative organ under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k).  The May 2023 rating decision found the Veteran lost his left testicle due to cancer.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k), special monthly compensation is payable if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs, or one foot, or one hand, or both buttocks, or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, has suffered complete organic aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech, or deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction, or, in the case of a woman veteran, has suffered the anatomical loss of 25 percent or more of tissue from a single breast or both breasts in combination (including loss by mastectomy or partial mastectomy) or has received radiation treatment of breast tissue.  

This special compensation is payable in addition to the basic rate of compensation otherwise payable on the basis of degree of disability, provided that the combined rate of compensation does not exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C.1114(l) when authorized in conjunction with any of the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1114 (a) through(j) or (s). When there is entitlement under 38 U.S.C. 1114 (l) through (n) or an intermediate rate under(p) such additional allowance is payable for each such anatomical loss or loss of use existing in addition to the requirements for the basic rates, provided the total does not exceed the monthly rate set forth in 38 U.S.C. 1114(o). The limitations on the maximum compensation payable under this paragraph are independent of and do not preclude payment of additional compensation for dependents under 38 U.S.C. 1115, or the special allowance for aid and attendance provided by 38 U.S.C. 1114(r). 38 C.F.R. §  3.350.

In this case, an August 2023 private treatment record shows the Veteran had an orchiectomy for classic seminoma in 2010.  The Veteran reported frequent urination and blood in his urine.  The clinician found no evidence of recurrent testicular cancer. The clinician found the Veteran does have urinary frequency.

There is no evidence of, and the Veteran does not assert, that he suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of one foot, or one hand, or both buttocks, or blindness of one eye, having only light perception, has suffered complete organic aphonia with constant inability to communicate by speech, or deafness of both ears, having absence of air and bone conduction, or, in the case of a woman veteran, has suffered the anatomical loss of 25 percent or more of tissue from a single breast or both breasts in combination (including loss by mastectomy or partial mastectomy) or has received radiation treatment of breast tissue.  He has not asserted, and the evidence does not show, that he is housebound or in need of regular aid and attendance.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (r) - (s).

As the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that an additional disability that qualifies for SMC is present, a higher level of SMC compensation is not warranted.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Board notes that the Veteran's arguments address the urinary frequency that may be associated with the rating of his testicular cancer residuals.  They do not address the criteria for a higher level of SMC.  As noted above, the Veteran may request that the AOJ re-adjudicate the rating for testicular cancer and its residuals, since the May 2023 rating decision stated the 0 percent rating for it was not final.
