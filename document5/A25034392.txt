DOCKET NO. 250116-509069
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment for beneficiary travel expenses for travel to and from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) on December 13, 2024, subject to regulations governing payment or reimbursement, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran traveled to and from a VA facility on December 13, 2024, for a primary care appointment; had a 100-percent combined disability rating and meets the eligibility criteria for beneficiary travel benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to payment or reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses for travel to and from the VA facility on December 13, 2024, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 111; 38 C.F.R. §§ 70.2, 70.10, 70.20, 70.30.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1970 to August 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a determination made by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in December 2024.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted evidence with the January 2025 VA Form 10182.  However, as discussed below, the claim will be granted in full.  Consequently, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding without clarifying whether he wanted to proceed on the Evidence docket.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).

The Board also acknowledges that the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) has not yet elapsed.  However, the Board finds that a docket switch letter pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024) is not necessary because there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with the granting of the claim. 

1. Beneficiary Travel 

The Veteran contends that he traveled to an authorized appointment at a VA facility on December 13, 2024, and that he should be reimbursed for mileage.  See January 2025 VA Form 10182. 

Applicable Regulatory Guidance 

Generally, VA beneficiary travel is a payment for travel expenses incurred in the United States to help Veterans and other persons obtain care or services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 38 U.S.C. § 111; 38 C.F.R. § 70.10.  A Veteran is eligible for beneficiary travel payments for travel to or from a VA facility or VA-authorized health care facility for the following: (1) treatment for a service-connected disability, regardless of the disability rating; (2) treatment for any disability, provided that the veteran has a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more; (3) a scheduled compensation and pension examination; (4) if the veteran receives pension under 38 U.S.C. § 1521 ; (5) if the veteran's annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension that the veteran would receive under 38 U.S.C. § 1521 ; or, (6) if, the veteran is unable to defray the expenses of that travel under certain circumstances.  38 C.F.R. § 70.10 (a).

Analysis 

The AOJ denied the claim for beneficiary travel on December 13, 2024, based on finding that the appointment associated with date of travel did not qualify for payment.  See December 2024 AOJ Decision.  The AOJ also made a favorable finding that the Veteran is administratively eligible for beneficiary travel benefits.  Id.  The Board is bound by this finding.  

The issue before the Board is whether the Veteran's appointment qualifies for beneficiary travel benefits.  

At the time of the December 13, 2024, VA appointment, the Veteran had a 100-percent rating for his combined service-connected disabilities.  He, therefore, qualifies for the beneficiary travel benefit regarding treatment for any disability.  38 C.F.R. § 70.10(a).

The record indicates that the Veteran was eligible for beneficiary travel reimbursement, and that he went to a VA primary care appointment on December 13, 2024.  The Board also notes that the AOJ did not indicate that the claim was untimely filed.  The record also confirms that the VA primary care appointment on December 13, 2024, was completed.  See December 2024 VA Primary Care Note in Beneficiary Travel File.  Thus, the evidence of record shows that the appointment existed, was completed, and was authorized, and that VHA found him otherwise eligible for beneficiary travel program benefits.

Therefore, the evidence is at least evenly balanced, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is for application.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application).

In sum, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that he traveled to his authorized appointment on December 13, 2024, for VA care for which he was eligible.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).  The Veteran's claim for beneficiary travel expenses related to travel to the VA Primary Care treatment on December 13, 2024, is therefore granted.
