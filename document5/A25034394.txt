ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II associated with herbicide exposure is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A September 2023 Board decision granted service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II associated with herbicide exposure pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board's September 2023 decision granted service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II on a presumptive basis. Then, the agency of jurisdiction (AOJ), in the September 2023 rating decision set the PACT Act effective date and effectuated the grant of the benefit. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7104; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.1100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1972 to November 1992.

By way of background, in a January 2019 special review decision, the AOJ denied service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II. The Veteran appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board); and during the appeal period, the PACT Act became law effective August 10, 2022.

In September 2023, following a hearing, the Board issued a decision granting service connection on a presumptive basis pursuant to the PACT Act. In a September 2023 rating decision, the AOJ implemented the Board's decision and assigned August 10, 2022, as the effective date. In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran attempted to appeal.

However, this issue must be dismissed as a matter of law. The Board recognizes the holding in Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194, 197 (2023) (finding that a Board decision is the final and conclusive determination of the Secretary as to any discrete issue decided in that decision, and a pure implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits). A rating decision that implements a grant of benefits by the Board is not a "decision" for appeal purposes, as the issue has already been determined by another part of the agency. Rather, such a rating decision is merely ministerial in nature. Id.

Because the September 2023 AOJ decision that effectuated the Board decision was not appealable to the Board, the Board cannot accept the July 2024 NOD as to that issue. Accordingly, the appeal to that issue is dismissed as a matter of law.
