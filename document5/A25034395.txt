DOCKET NO. 241015-482842
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is dismissed.  

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received notice that the Veteran died in October 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1985 to July 1994. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of a VA Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied service connection for prostate cancer.

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on which he identified the September 2024 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of this appeal.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  Therefore, this appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision.  This process is called substitution.  The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b).  To file a request for substitution, you may use VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant," which can be found online here: https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-0847-ARE.pdf.

The completed form may be submitted electronically via ACCESSVA.  The web address for ACCESSVA is https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=dmhs.

Alternatively, you may mail the completed form to:

				Department of Veterans Affairs

				Pension Intake Center

				P.O. Box 5365

				Janesville, WI 53547-5365

You may also submit the form directly to your nearest VA regional office.  To find a VA regional office nearest you go to https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?facilityType=benefits.

Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution.  A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5152(a) of this title...."  38 U.S.C. § 5152A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a).  There is a helpful factsheet that explains who is eligible for accrued benefits here: https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/general/Accrued.pdf
