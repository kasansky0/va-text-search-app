DOCKET NO. 241021-483581
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The October 2024 rating decision, from which the Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), was only a proposal to reduce the rating for allergic rhinitis from 10 percent to zero percent, and not a final decision on the matter.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) does not have jurisdiction over the issue of the proposal to reduce the rating for allergic rhinitis from 10 percent to zero percent. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1998 to April 2003. This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a rating decision issued in October 2024 by a Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Later the same month, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision to the Board by filing a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182).

In this regard, the Board notes that the time period during which the Veteran may switch to a different docket has not yet passed; however, as the appeal must be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, such is moot. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Proposal to reduce the rating for allergic rhinitis from 10 percent to zero percent disabling.

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104; 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.

Where action by the rating agency would result in the reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, a rating initially proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting out all material facts and reasons for the proposed action. The beneficiary of the compensation payments must be notified at his or her latest address of record of the contemplated action, furnished detailed reasons therefore, and be given 60 days from the date of the notice for the presentation of additional evidence to show that the compensation payments should be continued at their present level. Thereafter, if a reduced rating is found to be warranted, a final rating action will be issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

In the October 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) proposed to reduce the disability rating for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis from 10 percent to zero percent. Later the same month, he filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA From 10182) disagreeing with the proposal. However, as previously noted, the October 2024 rating decision was only a required notification to the Veteran of the proposed action and not a final decision on the matter. Rather, in a January 2025 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the disability rating for the Veteran's allergic rhinitis from 10 percent to zero percent, effective April 1, 2025. Therefore, no appeal could be initiated from the October 2024 rating decision. Consequently, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal and, as such, it must be dismissed.

In this regard, the Veteran is advised that, if disagrees with the January 2025 rating decision that effectuated the reduction, he may file a Decision Review Request within one year of the issuance of it.
