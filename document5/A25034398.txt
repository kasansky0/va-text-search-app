DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (claimed as PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD which has been attributed to his active duty service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.309, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1993 to July 1993, February 2001 to October 2001, December 2004 to May 2006, and from April 2009 to May 2010. His service decorations include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the NATO Afghanistan Service Medal, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

PTSD

In order to establish service connection for PTSD, the evidence of record must include 1) a medical diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a); 2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and 3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f). Lay testimony may be sufficient to corroborate an in-service stressor if the stressor is related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a) requires that the diagnosis conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (2013) (DSM-5).  

In this matter, the record shows that the Veteran submitted a private medical report and examination in August 2023. The disability questionnaire filled out by the private examiner noted that diagnosing criteria were from the DSM-5. The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD pursuant to the DSM-5 criteria and his diagnosis was based on stressors he encountered while deployed. Concurrently with the disability benefits questionnaire, the Veteran submitted a written report from his examiners. Review of his file was noted. The examiners provided further discussion of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms, diagnosis, and his in-service stressors. 

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination in December 2023. The examiner did not note review of the Veteran's private medical diagnosis or address his prior diagnosis of PTSD. The examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD or any other mental health disorder. The Board, however, cannot afford the December 2023 VA examination any probative value as a full discussion of the conflicting evidence contained the Veteran's file was not conducted or provided. Furthermore, the Board notes that seeking to obtain negative evidence against the Veteran is prohibited by VA law. See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).

As such, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record establishes that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD which conformed to the DSM-5 criteria and has been attributed to his active duty service. As such, the criteria for service connection for PTSD have been met and service connection is granted.
