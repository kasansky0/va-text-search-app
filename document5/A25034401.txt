ORDER

The issue of the proposed reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent for the service-connected left knee disability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The July 2024 rating decision that proposed a reduction of the Veteran's rating for the left knee disability is not an adjudicative decision that can be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The July 2024 rating decision proposing a reduction in the rating for the service-connected left knee disability is not a final rating action. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(e), 3.160(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2015 to January 2019. This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket without a Board hearing in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board (Notice of Disagreement)) in July 2024.

The issue of the proposed rating reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent for the left knee disability.

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104; 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.205. Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.

Here, the Board finds this appeal, which challenged the proposed rating reduction from 30 percent to 10 percent for the service-connected left knee disability must be dismissed as a matter of law.

On July 9, 2024, the RO proposed to reduce the Veteran's current 30 percent rating for the left knee disability to 10 percent. On July 10, 2024, the Veteran was given notice of the proposal as required under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). See 7/10/2024 Proposal to Reduce Service Connected Compensation. No subsequent rating decision had, or has ever, been issued reducing the Veteran's 30 percent rating. Then, on July 11, 2024, the Veteran prematurely filed a VA Form 10182, appealing the proposed reduction directly to the Board.

A proposed reduction is not a decision that can be appealed to the Board. Just as a deferred rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed, a proposed rating is not an adjudicative determination that can be appealed because the factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d). As the rating reduction was not implemented prior to the July 2024 submission of the VA Form 10182, there is no final action which can be appealed and dismissal of the appeal on this basis is warranted.

Therefore, the appeal of a proposed reduction of the disability rating for the left knee disability is dismissed as a matter of law.
