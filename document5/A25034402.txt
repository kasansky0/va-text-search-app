ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in the Appellant's favor, the Veteran's hypertension, which was a principal cause of death, at least as likely as not began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for cause of death have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1110, 1131, 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.5, 3.102, 3.303, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1961 to January 1981. Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away in December 2016. The Veteran's surviving spouse is the Appellant.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on January 22, 2025. A transcript of the hearing is included in the evidence of record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 RO decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302 (a), 20.801. The Board notes that the 90-day period to submit evidence after the hearing has not expired, however, the Board finds that the Appellant is not prejudiced by having the claim adjudicated now, as the instant decision represents a complete grant of the benefits sought on appeal.  

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902 (c).

Entitlement to service connection for cause of death

The Appellant and her representative contend that the Veteran began suffering from hypertension and respiratory issues while in service, and although the Veteran smoked tobacco, his hypertension may have worsened his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), thus contributing to his death.

To establish service connection for a veteran's cause of death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by active service was the principal or contributory cause of death. 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (a).

A principal cause of death is one which, singly or jointly with some other condition, was the immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related thereto. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (b). A contributory cause of death is one which contributed substantially or materially to cause death or aided or lent assistance to the production of death. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (c). A contributory cause of death is inherently one not related to the principal cause. In determining whether the service-connected disability contributed to death, it must be shown that it contributed substantially or materially; that it combined to cause death; that it aided or lent assistance to the production of death. It is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (c)(1).

As a preliminary matter, when the RO issued the decision on appeal, the only cause of death listed on the Veteran's death certificate was COPD. A February 2025 letter from the Veteran's private physician Dr. M.A. stated that the Veteran carried a diagnosis of hypertension which he had for many years dating back to his service in the military, which led to him having a stroke, which left him disabled and unable to care for himself to any degree. The physician added that the Veteran's disability, along with his COPD, ultimately led to his passing and that the diagnosis of hypertension should be added to his death certificate as a contributing factor to his death. In March 2025, the Appellant submitted an amended death certificate listing the immediate cause of death as COPD and the underlying causes as hypertension and stroke. As the amended death certificate lists hypertension as an underlying cause, the Board finds that hypertension was a principal cause of death under 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (a).

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's hypertension was related to service. Determinations as to whether service connection may be granted for a disability that caused or contributed to a veteran's death are based on the same statutory and regulatory provisions that generally govern determinations of service connection.

VA regulations establish that certain diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents may be presumed to have been incurred in service even if there is no evidence of the disease in service, provided the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6) are met. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). A veteran who, during active service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 C.F.R.§ 3.307 (a). In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the RO conceded that the Veteran was presumptively exposed to herbicide agents due to his service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

In August 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act was enacted. The PACT Act amended the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents to include hypertension. Prior to the PACT Act, hypertension was not included on that list. As such, hypertension cannot be service connected on a presumptive basis as due to herbicide agent exposure from an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, the effective date for implementation of the PACT Act. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a). As the Appellant previously submitted a claim for service connection for cause of death that was denied by the RO in August 2022, less than one year before she submitted the May 2023 supplemental claim, the Board must determine whether service connection for cause of death may be established on a direct basis, as the review period begins prior to implementation of the PACT Act.

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Any reasonable doubt regarding the claim is resolved in favor of the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107. When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other point, such doubt should be resolved in favor of the claimant. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

There is evidence against and in favor of the claim. Evidence against the claim includes the following. In April 1981, a VA compensation and pension examiner noted that the Veteran had a history of dizziness and fainting spells and noted "no hypertension." His recumbent blood pressure was recorded as 130 systolic over 85 diastolic. The Board assigns no probative value to the examiner's statement that there is "no hypertension," because the examiner made this evaluation under blood pressure guidelines in place at the time of the examination.

In August 2022, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's COPD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness because the most important risk factor for COPD/emphysema is cigarette smoking. The Board assigns very limited value to this opinion because it does not address whether the Veteran's hypertension was related to his military service. At the time this opinion was made, the only cause of death listed on the Veteran's death certificate was COPD. 

Evidence in favor of the claim includes the following. An October 2023 letter from the Veteran's private physician Dr. M.A. stated that the Veteran was a patient of his for many years until he passed away and among his many medical problems, he was treating him for hypertension. Also, as mentioned, a February 2025 letter from this physician stated that the Veteran carried with him a diagnosis of hypertension dating back to his military service. 

In January 2025, the Appellant submitted an undated letter from private physician Dr. C.R. This physician stated that he reviewed medical records spanning the Veteran's care from April 1957 through his passing in 2016 and his service treatment records demonstrated uncontrolled blood pressure readings of 142 over 100 meeting current criteria for stage 2 hypertension. The physician stated that there is also a demonstration of dyspnea, chest pain, and dizziness with these episodes beginning in 1969 and he continued to have uncontrolled measurements throughout his medical records, and frequent episodes of dizziness or vertigo and intermittent chest pain. The Board notes that the Veteran's military retirement report of medical history lists headaches, dizziness/fainting spells, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, palpitation or pounding heart, and high or low blood pressure, consistent with Dr. C.R.'s opinion. 

The Board also notes that the service treatment records show mildly elevated blood pressure readings in February 1969 (142 over 100), September 1976 (122 over 90), February 1977 (130 over 90) and in January 1979 (130/96). The Board assigns high probative value to Dr. C.R.'s opinion because it is consistent with the objective service treatment records and the Appellant's testimony that the Veteran had high blood pressure, shortness of breath, headaches, and a fainting spell while on active duty.

Thus, upon review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's cause of death, hypertension, began in service.  Accordingly, after resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Appellant, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for cause of death, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
