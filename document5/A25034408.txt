ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an April 2024 decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) referenced February 1988 denials of service connection for hemorrhoids and a back disability and indicated that it was issued "for backfill purposes only."  

2. In July 2024, the Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), identifying the issues to be appealed as hemorrhoids and back problems and the date of decision as April 2024.

3. The April 2024 backfill decision is not an adjudicative decision subject to appellate review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4(a)(1), 20.104(c), 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for a back disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4(a)(1), 20.104(c), 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1976 to August 1980.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision adjudicated under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Within the framework of the AMA, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge in July 2024.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  The Board notes that under the direct review option, no additional evidence received after the appealed rating decision is to be considered; rather, review is limited to the evidence on record at the time of the decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2(d), 20.301.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is dismissed.

By way of background, the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids and a back disability were initially denied in February 1988.  See November 1987 VA Form 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension; February 1988 Notification Letter (e.g., VA Form 20-8993, VA Form 21-0290, PCGL).

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim of entitlement to service connection for back problems on VA Form 21-526EZ.  Thereafter, in a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ deferred a decision on entitlement to compensation for back problems and indicated that the issue was being deferred to reschedule a pending examination.  See March 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative; March 2024 Notification Letter (e.g., VA Form 20-8993, VA Form 21-0290, PCGL).  

In April 2024, the AOJ issued a decision which was meant "for backfill purposes only."  The issues included in the decision were entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids and a back disability, and the AOJ indicated that both decisions were backfilled to February 1, 1988.  See April 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.

In May 2024, the AOJ sent a letter to the Veteran acknowledging receipt of his December 2023 request to file a claim for back problems, which had previously been denied.  In this regard, the letter explained that VA regulations required him to file his claim on the proper form and explained that no action would be taken until the completed form was received.  See April 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative; May 2024 Request for Application AMA Review Letter.

Thereafter, in July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and indicated that he wanted to appeal the April 2024 backfill decision.  See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

Under the AMA, a NOD is defined as "an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the [AOJ] and a desire to contest the result."  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d).  In this regard, the Notice must "identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees."  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Thus, "before a claimant may file a NOD, there must be some 'adjudicative determination' to contest."  Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461-62 (2011).

Here, the April 2024 decision was issued "for backfill purposes only."  As a general matter, backfill rating decisions are internal record-keeping mechanisms undertaken to facilitate proper award processing and do not, in and of themselves, constitute new or free-standing entitlement determinations.  Rather, backfill rating decisions enter prior rating decision data that may not appear on the Codesheet or in the corporate database.

The Court has determined that "agency action that only implements an earlier agency decision is ministerial, not adjudicative, because the action lacks the requisite assessment of legal or factual issues."  Cardoza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 407, 411 (2024) (citing Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194, 200 (2023)).  Ultimately, actions that "do nothing more than implement a grant of benefits already determined by another agency department [fall] outside the definition of a "decision" because [they lack] the requisite assessment of legal or factual issues.  Such [actions]...merely [effectuate] an earlier judgment and [leave] no room during implementation for choice or discretion."  Encarnacion, 36 Vet. App. at 200 (2023).  Therefore, decisions issued for "backfill purposes only[,]"do not constitute decisions from which a NOD may be filed.  

Here, the Veteran has challenged the April 2024 rating decision denying service connection for hemorrhoids and a back disability; however, the April 2024 rating decision was issued for backfill purposes only.  Therefore, there was no adjudicative decision from which a NOD could be filed.  

In reaching the above conclusions, the Board notes that, prior to issuing the May 2024 letter informing the Veteran that he submitted his claims on the wrong form, the AOJ ordered additional development, which seems to suggest its acceptance of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a back disability.  If the Veteran believes that his December 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ remains pending and unadjudicated based on the AOJ's implicit acceptance of such by seeking development, he should pursue such adjudication with the AOJ in the first instance.  See DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52, 56 (2006) (holding that the proper procedure for a claimant to pursue "a claim believed to be unadjudicated (and for which there is no final decision that arguably failed to consider the claim) is to pursue a resolution of the original claim, e.g., seek issuance of a final [AOJ] decision with proper notification of appellate rights and initiate" a Notice of Disagreement).  The Veteran may also file a Supplemental Claim on a VA Form 20-0995, along with new and relevant evidence for VA to consider, as detailed by the AOJ in its May 2024 letter.  

Thus, with respect to his claims of entitlement to service connection for hemorrhoids and a back disability, there is no justiciable issue before the Board and the appeals must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

REASONS FOR REMAND

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is remanded.

Initially, the Board finds that the AOJ committed pre-decisional duty to assist errors by failing to obtain private medical records identified by the Veteran prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  In this regard, during his November 2023 VA examination for knee and lower leg conditions, the Veteran reported that he was shot in the left leg three times during a robbery and underwent extensive surgery at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) in or around June 2010.  See December 2023 C&P examination.

However, neither records from the Veteran's June 2010 injury or subsequent treatment, to include extensive surgery, nor any private treatment records from UMMC have been associated with the claims file.  Thus, the Board finds that a remand is required to obtain these records to cure the duty to assist errors with regard to obtaining private medical records.

In addition, the Board finds that some of the VA treatment records identified as reviewed by the AOJ in the March 2024 rating decision on appeal have not been associated with the claims file.  Specifically, the March 2024 rating decision shows that medical records from the VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Jackson, Mississippi dated from August 1999 to February 2024 were reviewed in connection with the decision.  However, the Board notes that the earliest VA treatment records currently associated with the Veteran's claims file are dated in August 2019 and that no unavailable records response has been received.  See December 2023 CAPRI.  Thus, the Board also finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to associate VA records reviewed in connection with the March 2024 rating decision with the Veteran's claims file, and as such, that a remand is also required to obtain these records.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2502.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request and obtain all outstanding VA treatment records from the VAMC in Jackson Mississippi dated from August 1999 to August 2019, to include any archived VA treatment records.

If any treatment records are unavailable, issue a formal finding of unavailability and notify the Veteran so that he can submit any medical records in his possession.

2. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for all records related to his June 2010 injury/gunshot wound to his left lower extremity and subsequent treatment and all relevant medical treatment records from the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) dated in or around June 2010, to include all surgical treatment records.
