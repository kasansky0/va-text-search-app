ORDER

Service connection for sinusitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence does not show that the Veteran has a current sinusitis disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for a sinusitis disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 3.309; Diagnostic Code 6523.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1966 to April 1973, from June 1974 to March 1982, and from February 1990 to October 1992.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran filed the claim for service connection for "broken nose to include sinusitis problem" in July 2023. In a December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for nasal bone fracture. The AOJ denied service connection for sinusitis in a February 2024 rating decision. The Veteran requested a higher-level review, and in the July 2024 rating decision the AOJ again denied service connection for sinusitis.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing Docket. A Board hearing was held in December 2024. A transcript of the hearing is in the record. No further evidence was received after the hearing.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires competent evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury, or for additional disability resulting from the aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The Veteran contends that he has sinusitis that was incurred in service or is due to service.

Service treatment records (STRs) show that the Veteran had several physical examinations during his military career where evaluating physicians noted normal findings for the sinuses. Specifically, Reports of Medical Examination for January 1974, May 1978, April 1982, December 1986, September 1988, and May 1989 show normal findings.

STRs show that the Veteran was examined in January 1978 for a complaint of injury to the nasal bridge while playing basketball. The diagnosis was fractured nasal bone.

In October 1984 the Veteran was treated for a complaint of sinus congestion. The medical assessment was upper respiratory infection with bronchitis. In February 1985 the Veteran was treated for sinus congestion where the medical assessment was "rule-out sinusitis."

At the Veteran's examination for retirement in July 1992, the evaluating physician noted normal findings for the sinuses.

January 2021 private treatment records show that the Veteran denied current rhinorrhea, or acute or chronic nasal congestion, at a chiropractic office visit. November 2022 private treatment records show that the Veteran denied nasal congestion at a medical clinic visit.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2023. The examiner performed a physical examination of the Veteran and reviewed the Veteran's medical records and claims file. The Veteran reported that he could not recall the circumstances of his condition in service, but reported that he had bleeding, swelling and terrible breathing. The Veteran also reported that he had no current symptoms or current treatment. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with allergic rhinitis, but not chronic sinusitis. The examiner reviewed the results of X-rays taken in conjunction with the examination which showed moderate chronic mucosal thickening nasal turbinate regions; otherwise, no other radiographic findings involving the sinuses. The examiner stated that there was no diagnosis of sinusitis because there were no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis.

At the December 2024 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he was diagnosed with sinusitis a few times while in the service, and that he had problems with breathing at night and having to get up to blow his nose, which have continued to the present. He stated that the problem is more than just seasonal.

The Veteran has asserted throughout the appeal that he has a current sinusitis condition due to service. The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms. However, service connection requires a finding of a current disability. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (stating that "Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability"). After reviewing all evidence of record including the Veteran's Board testimony, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for sinusitis, as he does not have a current sinusitis disability.

The Board finds that the Veteran's in-service complaints of sinus congestion in 1984 and 1985 resolved. The Veteran had medical examinations in 1986, 1988, and 1989, and for his retirement in 1992, where examining physicians noted normal findings on examination of the sinuses. Therefore, he did not have chronic sinus issues during service. 

The Veteran's available medical records associated with the claims file do not show a current diagnosis for sinusitis, per the November 2023 VA examination. That conclusion is significant probative medical evidence because the examiner examined the Veteran, considered his lay statements, reviewed the claims file, and provided a detailed rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). The VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not have any sinus, nose, throat, larynx, or pharynx condition that impacted his ability to work. The Board has considered the Veteran's testimony regarding his symptoms and the objective and lay evidence and finds that his symptoms did not cause functional impairment that affects earning capacity, and therefore do not constitute a disability pursuant to Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

Because there is no evidence of a current sinusitis disability, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted, and the claim is denied. As the evidence is against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.
