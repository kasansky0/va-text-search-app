ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left eye cancer is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left eye cancer is at least as likely as not related to his service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left eye cancer are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1956 to December 1958, and from May 1960 to July 1978, including two combat deployments to Vietnam.  The Veteran's many awards and decorations include the Purple Heart, Combat Infantry Badge, and the Air Medal with Five Oak Leaf Clusters.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his many years of valorous, honorable, and courageous service to our country in a time of war.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

This matter has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.8009(c).

In the September 19, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on January 8, 2025.  A transcript of that hearing is of record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for left eye cancer, to include as due to herbicide exposure in Vietnam.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

There is no dispute that the Veteran has left eye cancer and there is no dispute that he was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Vietnam.

Pursuant to the AMA, the Board is bound by previous findings of fact that are favorable to the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Here, the AOJ has found and conceded that both that the Veteran is currently diagnosed with left eye cancer and that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Vietnam.  See September 2024 Rating Decision.

A Veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in or near the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the Veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).

Service in Vietnam includes the landmass and the territorial sea, which is defined as the 12 nautical miles surrounding Vietnam.  See Procopio v. Wilkie, 913 F.3d 1375-1376, 1379-1380 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (emphasis added).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e), a presumption of service connection arises for a Vietnam Veteran who develops one of several enumerated conditions associated with herbicide agent exposure.  The enumerated diseases shall be service connected, even if there is no record of such disease during service, provided that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

Choroidal melanoma, which is the type of eye cancer the Veteran has, is not included on the list of diseases presumed to have been incurred in service in Vietnam.  38 U.S.C. § 1116(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e).  However, the Veteran may still be entitled to service connection on a direct basis if the evidence establishes that this cancer is related to his active duty military service.

Therefore, the only question before the Board is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current left eye cancer diagnosis and his in-service herbicide agent exposure or any other in-service incurrence or aggravation.

The Veteran received a VA examination for left eye cancer in August 2024.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's left eye cancer is less likely than not due to his service.  See August 2024 VA Examination.  As rationale the examiner explained that there currently is not enough medical research to support "the claim that exposure to Agent Orange herbicide results in an elevated risk of choroidal melanoma."  Id.

However, the examiner also specifically noted that, after review of the Veteran's records, the Veteran does not have any other risk factors for choroidal melanoma other than his military service.  Id.

In other words, although the VA examiner was not able to specifically link the Veteran's Agent Orange exposure to his eye cancer, the examiner did find that the Veteran's twenty years of active duty military service and all the risk factors and exposures this entailed-including two combat deployments-were his only risk factors for developing this very rare form of cancer.  

The Board emphasizes that the Federal Circuit has held that there is a difference between the "as likely as not" adjudication standard and a determination that something is medically or scientifically certain.  See Hodges v. Sec'y of Dep't of Health and Human Servs., 9 F. 3d 958, 965 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Newman, J. dissenting); Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 388 n.1 (2016).  

The Board also emphasizes that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reiterated in Wise that "[b]y requiring only an 'approximate balance of positive and negative evidence' to prove any issue material to a claim for Veterans benefits, 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), the nation, 'in recognition of our debt to our Veterans,' has 'taken upon itself the risk of error' in awarding such benefits." Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014) (citing Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54 (1990)).

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board therefore finds that the evidence both for and against his claim is at least approximately balanced; therefore, the claim for entitlement to service connection for left eye cancer is hereby GRANTED.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
