FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  A September 2016 rating decision denied service connection for idiopathic small fiber peripheral neuropathy; the Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year, and the September 2016 rating decision became final.

2.  There is no record of any communication received by VA prior to April 15, 2022, indicating an intent to request readjudication of the previously denied claim for service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from April 1990 to April 1994.  He is the recipient of, among other decorations, a Combat Action Ribbon.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision by the Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran filed an appeal to the Board by way of a July 2024 notice of disagreement (Form 10182) and requested Direct Review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket on his July 2024 notice of disagreement.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.   Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  See Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

1.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the award of service connection for right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy with lower radicular group nerve involvement

2.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the award of service connection for left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy with lower radicular group nerve involvement

3.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy with sciatic nerve involvement

4.  Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 21, 2023, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy with sciatic nerve involvement

A September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy with lower radicular group nerve involvement, and for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy with sciatic nerve involvement, all effective June 21, 2023.  The Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for service connection.

The effective date of an award of service connection based on an original claim for service connection or request to readjudicate a previously denied claim will generally "be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later."  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (2024); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) (2012).

Effective on March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations, effectively eliminating informal claims and requiring a "complete claim" on a form proscribed by the Secretary.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.160 (2024).  

If VA receives a complete claim within one year of receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b) (2024).

The mere existence of medical records generally cannot be construed as an informal claim; rather, there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for a benefit.  Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 504 (2006).  

Likewise, the effective date for an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence demonstrating a causal connection, but on the date of the claim for service connection.  See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). 

Private treatment records dated in 2015 show diagnosed idiopathic peripheral neuropathy.  See Records, June 2016 at p.2 and 12.  A July 2023 VA examination report shows the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy in 2017.  

A September 2016 rating decision denied service connection for idiopathic small fiber peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within one year of the September 2016 rating decision, and the decision became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.302, 20.1103 (2016).

Since the September 2016 rating decision, no correspondence was received from the Veteran or his representative until the filing of an Intent to File a Claim (Form 21-0966) on April 15, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. 3.155(b).  The specific benefit sought was not noted in the form.  In April 2022, the RO acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Intent to File and notified him that he must complete a Form 21-526EZ in order to begin processing a claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5102; 38 C.F.R. § 3.150(a).  The Board notes, however, that Form 21-526EZ would not be the proper form prescribed by the Secretary to request readjudication of a previously denied claim.  Rather, the proper form would have been a Form 21-0995, Supplemental Claim.  Nevertheless, within one year, on April 14, 2023, the Veteran filed a Form 21-526EZ as suggested by the RO.  In May 2023, the RO sent a letter to the Veteran requesting that the claim be filed on the "proper form," but the letter failed to explain which form was proper.  On June 21, 2023, the Veteran submitted a Form 21-0995, Supplemental Claim, which is the proper form for a request for readjudication of a previously denied claim.  A September 2023 rating decision granted service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, effective June 21, 2023.  The Veteran appealed the effective dates.

If within one year of filing an intent to file a claim, VA receives a complete application form on the form prescribed by the Secretary, VA will consider the complete claim as being filed as of the date of the intent to file the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  

As explained above, in April 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim (which did not identify any specific claim).  Within one year, in April 2023, the Veteran filed the Form 21-526EZ requesting readjudication of the peripheral neuropathy claims ("neurological issues"), on the form suggested by the RO, which form was unfortunately incorrect.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(c), upon receipt of an incomplete application form, VA is required to notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application on a form prescribed by the Secretary, and if a complete claim is received within one year of receipt of the incomplete application, VA will consider it filed as of the date VA received the incomplete application.  Unfortunately, the RO failed to notify the Veteran what is the proper form prescribed by the Secretary in a May 2023 notification letter; rather, the RO simply requested the "proper form."  Regardless, within one year, in June 2023, the Veteran nonetheless submitted the proper form prescribed by the Secretary to request readjudication of the claims, a Form 21-0995, Supplemental Claim.  As such, the Board finds that the June 2023 Supplemental Claim relates back to the April 2023 incomplete application, which related back to the May 2022 Intent to File.  Thus, the Board finds that the date of the claim for purposes of the Veteran's request for readjudication of the claim for service connection for upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was April 15, 2022.  Accordingly, because the earliest possible effective date is the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, the Board finds that entitlement to earlier effective dates of April 15, 2022, are warranted for the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathies.

The Board further finds that the weight of the evidence is most persuasively against finding entitlement to effective dates prior to April 15, 2022, for the awards of service connection for the bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathies.  As explained above, the Veteran did not express disagreement within one year of the September 2016 rating decision that denied the initial claims for service connection, which became final.  Thereafter, no communication was received from him until April 15, 2022, when he filed an intent to file a claim, followed by the complete claim on a proper form in June 2023.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the earliest possible effective date for an award based on a reopened or readjudicated claim is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  Thus, without any communication from the Veteran or his representative expressing an intent to file a request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy prior to April 15, 2022, there can be no earlier effective date.  While the Board acknowledges that the Veteran is shown to have diagnosed peripheral neuropathy in 2015, as explained above, the earliest possible effective date as a matter of law is the date of the claim, or date entitlement arose (e.g., diagnosis), whichever is later.  Although the Veteran was diagnosed as early as 2015, the date of the claim (intent to file) was not until April 15, 2022.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran asserted in his notice of disagreement that "the VA failed to consider presumptive service connection and evidence of current disability" in a prior final September 2016 rating decision that denied service connection for peripheral neuropathy.  The Board wishes to clarify, however, that the issue of whether there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the September 2016 rating decision is not before the Board in this appeal.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  

A request for revision of a rating decision on the basis of CUE "must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error."  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(vii)(B).  "Non-specific allegations of failure to follow regulations or failure to give due process, or any other general, non-specific allegations of error are insufficient to satisfy the requirements" of pleading with specificity.  See id.    

The Board finds that the Veteran's statement alleging error in the September 2016 rating decision did not amount to a CUE motion.  His statement was general, and he did not plead, with specificity, the alleged clear and unmistakable error of fact or law in the prior decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  He did not even mention "clear and unmistakable error," and otherwise his statement was simply too general.

Even if the Veteran's statement had been sufficient to constitute a motion for revision on the basis of CUE, such a motion would be adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance before it could be appealed to the Board.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A(e) (motions for revision of a rating decision on the basis of CUE shall be decided in the same manner as any other claim).  To date, there has been no adjudication by the AOJ of any CUE motion in the first instance from which the Veteran could appeal.  Thus, the Board finds that a CUE motion is not properly on appeal herein.  To the extent the Veteran desires to file a CUE motion, he is invited to do so in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.

In summary, the Board concludes that entitlement to earlier effective dates of April 15, 2022, for the awards of service connection for bilateral upper and lower extremity peripheral neuropathies is warranted, and to that extent only, the claims are granted, and entitlement to effective dates prior to April 15, 2022, is denied.  Because there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit of the doubt rule is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
