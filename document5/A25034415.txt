REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from January 2014 to January 2020.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023 decision. In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2024 decision. In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023 decision regarding the issues of increased ratings for eczema and allergic rhinitis, the reduction of lumbosacral strain, and service connection for scars. Additionally, the May 2024 HLR decision on appeal considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2024 decision regarding the issues of service connection for a left and right lower extremity nerve disabilities. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of either the April 2023 decision or March 2024 decision, depending on the disorder for consideration.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 or March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Reductions

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that the notice requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) are not for application. Prior to the April 2023 rating action on appeal, the combined disability rating for the service-connected disorders was 90 percent, effective January 14, 2020. As a result of the April 2023 rating action decreasing the rating for lumbosacral strain, the combined disability remained 90 percent; the Veteran's actual payments never decreased. Therefore, the reliance concerns reflected in the above regulation were not implicated, and no notice proposing a reduction was required in this case.

Turning to the propriety of the reduction, the criteria governing certain rating reductions for certain service-connected disabilities is found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344. The provisions of 3.344(a) and(b) apply to ratings that have been continued for five years or more. Reexamination disclosing improvement will warrant a rating reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c). Nevertheless, in Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993), the Court stated that there are general VA regulations that apply to all rating reductions regardless of whether the rating has been in effect for five years or more. Id. at 420-421.

Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 requires that each disability be viewed in relation to its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 establishes that it is the reasonability of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. Furthermore, 38 C.F.R. § 4.13 provides that the rating agency should assure itself that there has been an actual change in the condition, for better or worse, and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in use of descriptive terms. Additionally, in any rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but that such improvement reflects improvement in ability to function under ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 420-21. A claim as to whether a rating reduction was proper must be resolved in the veteran's favor unless the Board concludes that a preponderance of evidence weighs against the claim. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421.

1. The reduction of the rating assigned to the Veteran's lumbosacral strain from 20 percent to 10 percent disabling was proper

The Veteran contents that her disability rating of 20 percent should be restored. Specifically, she contends that the severity of her service-connected lumbosacral strain warrants a rating in excess of 10 percent. 

The 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain had been in effect for less than 5 years at the time the reduction took place. It was in effect from January 2020 to January 2023. Therefore, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a) and (b) do not apply.

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243) (General Rating Formula), or under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes (Diagnostic Code 5243) (IVDS Rating Formula), whichever method results in the higher rating when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Ratings under the General Rating Formula are made with or without symptoms such as pain (whether it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.

Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees, but not greater than 85 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees, but not greater than 235 degrees; muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. Id. 

A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees, but not greater than 60 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. Id.

VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran sought treatment for low back pain. In a February 2021 treatment note, the Veteran described her back pain as constantly sore with increased pain more frequently. The Veteran reported that she was very active but avoided using weights. A December 2022 primary care progress note stated that the Veteran good range of motion for her back. 

During a March 2021 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of lumbosacral strain. She Veteran reported daily moderate flareups lasting 2 to 3 hours, which were alleviated by rest and over-counter-medication. The examiner measured the Veteran's initial range of motion as follows: forward flexion was 75 degrees; extension was 25 degrees; right lateral flexion was 25 degrees; left lateral flexion was 25 degrees; right lateral rotation was 25 degrees; and left lateral rotation was 25 degrees. The examiner observed pain during active range of motion, which was the same as passive range of motion. The examiner measured the Veteran's range of motion following three repetitions as follows: forward flexion as 70 degrees; extension was 20 degrees; right lateral flexion was 20 degrees; left lateral flexion was 20 degrees; right lateral rotation was 20 degrees; and left lateral rotation was 20 degrees. The examiner estimated that repeated use over time would cause pain and lack of endurance. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion following repeated use as follows: forward flexion was 60 degrees; extension was 15 degrees; right lateral flexion was 15 degrees; left lateral flexion was 15 degrees; right lateral rotation was 15 degrees; and left lateral rotation was 15 degrees. The examiner estimated the Veteran's range of motion during flareups as follows: forward flexion was 50 degrees; extension was 10 degrees; right lateral flexion was 10 degrees; left lateral flexion was 10 degrees; right lateral rotation was 10 degrees; and left lateral rotation was 10 degrees. The Veteran did not exhibit localized tenderness, guarding, or muscle spasms. The Veteran did not have ankylosis.

During a January 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of service-connected lumbosacral strain. The Veteran denied any prior surgery, being hospitalized within the prior year for her back and flareups. She described non-radiating lower back pain when walking longer than 40 minutes or sitting for over an hour. The examiner measured the Veteran's initial range of motion as follows: forward flexion was 90 degrees; extension was 25 degrees; right lateral flexion was 30 degrees; left lateral flexion was 25 degrees; right lateral rotation was 30 degrees; and left lateral rotation was 30 degrees. The examiner observed pain with forward flexion, which did not result in functional loss. The examiner did not perform passive range of motion testing because it was medically contraindicated. The Veteran did not have crepitus or exhibit evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation. The Veteran was capable of performing repetitive use testing with no additional loss of function or range of motion. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have muscle spasms or guarding. The Veteran did not demonstrate any additional contributing factors. 

Based on the January 2023 VA examination finding, an April 2023 rating decision reduced the 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain to 10 percent, effective January 25, 2023. As of this date, the disability rating had been in effect for less than 4 years, and, thus, a reexamination disclosing improvement in this disability would warrant a rating reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c).

The Board finds the evidence of record persuasively demonstrates an improvement in the disability supporting the reduction in evaluation of lumbar spine disability. The basis for the assignment of a 20 percent evaluation consisted of examination findings documenting forward flexion of the lumbar spine to 50 degrees during flareups which met the diagnostic criteria for a 20 percent rating. The January 2023 examination findings showed that the range of forward flexion had improved by 40 degrees, to 90 degrees. Moreover, this improvement was consistent even when functional impairment due to factors such as pain were taken into account. Even when looking at the combined range of motion there was improvement, which demonstrates improvement in other planes of excursion. Specifically, at worst, the former combined range of motion was to 100 degrees in March 2021, which the examiner estimated during flareups. By January 2023, the combined range of motion, at worst, was 230 degrees, and the Veteran denied flareups. The Veteran's lumbar spine disorder, which is rated based on impaired motion, clearly improved. Moreover, the Board finds that these improvements are under the ordinary conditions of work and life.

The Board notes that the lumbar spine disorder has not been defined by examiners as including intervertebral disc syndrome, and thus the proper comparison point for improvement is range of motion. The Veteran's pain in the lumbar spine has been persistent, and so the only change in the disorder has been the improved range of motion. This improved range of motion exists even when functional impairment and flare ups are taken into account.

In light of the above, the Board is persuaded against restoration of the 20 percent rating for a lumbosacral strain. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the appellant working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's entire history is considered when assigning disability ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995). A review of the recorded history of a disability is necessary to make an accurate rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.41. The regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings where such current findings are adequate and relevant to the rating issue. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994); Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31 (1999). The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis

The Veteran contends that her service-connected allergic rhinitis warrants a compensable rating. 

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent raring for allergic rhinitis pursuant to Diagnostic Code 6522. 

Under Diagnostic Code 6522 for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A maximum 30 percent disability rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

VA treatment records demonstrated a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. 

During a March 2021 VA examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The examiner noted that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis did not cause greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage, complete obstruction of the right or left side, nor nasal polyps. The examiner stated that the Veteran had permanent hypertrophy of the nasal passage. The Veteran did not have a granulomatous condition, or scars associated with her allergic rhinitis. 

During a January 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a service-connected diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The Veteran reported taking daily medication for her allergic rhinitis due to symptoms of runny nose and itchy eyes year round. The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have greater than 50 percent obstruction on both sides of nasal passage nor complete obstruction of either the left or right side. The Veteran did not have permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, nor a granulomatous condition. 

Based on a review of the record, the Board finds that compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is not warranted. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis did not manifest as 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. 

To the extent that the Veteran may believe that she is entitled to a higher rating for her allergic rhinitis, the Board finds the objective medical findings by skilled professionals are more persuasive which, as indicated above, do not support higher ratings. There are no other diagnostic codes or ratings that would be appropriate in the evaluation of the Veteran's disability as the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is listed in the Rating Schedule. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336-37 (2015) (holding that when a diagnosed condition is specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, rating by analogy is inappropriate).

As the medical evidence is persuasively against the finding of a greater than 50-percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction on one side, or nasal polyps, the Board finds that a compensable for allergic rhinitis is not warranted. As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable, and the Veteran's claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for eczema

The Veteran contends that her service-connected eczema warrants a compensable rating.

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a noncompensable rating for eczema located on the head, face, and neck pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7806. 

Diagnostic Code 7806 is to be rated under the General Rating Formula for Skin, under which a 10 percent rating will be assigned if the disability meets at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body; or (ii) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (iii) intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

A 30 percent rating will be assigned if the disability meets at least one of the following: (i) characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or (ii) systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7806 (2018).

The Federal Circuit addressed the meaning of "systemic" and "topical" for rating skin disabilities under the regulatory criteria prior to August 31, 2018. See Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017). For these purposes, systemic therapy means treatment pertaining to or affecting the body as a whole, whereas topical therapy means treatment pertaining to a particular surface area, as a topical anti-infective applied to a certain area of the skin and affecting only the area to which it is applied. Id. at 1355. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that a topical corticosteroid treatment could meet the definition of systemic therapy if it was administered on a large enough scale such that is affected the body as a whole, but the Court emphasized that this possibility does not mean that all applications of topical corticosteroids amount to systemic therapy. Id. Rather, the use of a topical corticosteroid could be considered either systemic therapy or topical therapy based on the facts of each case. Id. at 1356.

VA regulations explicitly state that for the purposes of the skin disability ratings, "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin." 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

VA treatment records demonstrated that the Veteran has eczema located on her face. In August 2022, the Veteran reported a distant history of eczema on her feet from her army boots. She recalled a flare that spread around her mouth and cheeks. She reported using colloidal silver soap and aloe vera gel over the counter. In December 2022, the Veteran reported eczema on her face with episodes of hives and itching causing hypopigmentation.

During a January 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted a service-connected diagnosis of eczema. The Veteran reported that she began a topical ointment treatment that week but did not recall prior treatment. She stated that her eczema flares occurred on her cheeks and around the ears rather than the body. The examiner observed a rough, flesh tone annular macule under 2 centimeters on the left cheek, which was consistent with eczema. The examiner stated that the Veteran was using topical treatment for under 6 weeks. The Veteran had not undergone any treatments or procedures other than systemic or topical medications within the prior 12 months. The examiner estimated that the Veteran's total body and exposed area were under 5 percent. The Veteran did not have a benign or malignant neoplasm or metastases related to her eczema. Her eczema did not cause scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. 

As indicated by the examination of record, the area encompassed by the Veteran's eczema, whether looking at overall surface area or to just the exposed areas, is not sufficient to establish entitlement to a compensable rating under the applicable rating criteria. Nor does the disorder require systemic therapy as defined by the Federal Circuit and by regulation. In addition, the eczema does not result in scarring or any noted disfigurement. As such, entitlement to a compensable rating for eczema is denied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, are subject to presumptive service connection if it manifests to a compensable degree within one year from separation from service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

To establish service connection under this provision, there must be evidence of a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under C.F.R. § 3.307) and subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease. The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology, however, can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly enumerated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

When there is an approximate balance in the evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, reasonable doubt will be resolved in each such issue in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An appellant need only demonstrate that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in order to prevail. To deny a claim on its merits, the preponderance of the evidence must be against the claim. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

4. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity nerve disability, to include on a secondary basis

5. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity nerve disability, to include on a secondary basis

6. Entitlement to service connection for scars of the head, face, or neck, to include on a secondary basis

Service treatment records are silent for any scars of the head, face, or neck or a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability.

VA treatment records are silent for any scars of the head, face, or neck or a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability. 

During a March 2021 VA examination, the examiner only noted a service-connected right wrist scar. The examiner noted no scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. 

During a March 2021 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have radiculopathy. The Veteran's muscle strength testing, reflex exam, and sensory exam were normal. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any other neurologic abnormalities associated with her thoracolumbar spine.  

During a January 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have scars from eczema. Additionally, the Veteran denied a claim for scars due to eczema. Therefore, the examiner stated that no medical opinion was required. 

During a January 2023 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have radiculopathy. The Veteran described non-radiating lower back pain. The Veteran's muscle strength testing, reflex exam, and sensory exam were normal. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any other neurologic abnormalities associated with her thoracolumbar spine. 

During a February 2024 VA examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran did not have radiculopathy. The Veteran's muscle strength testing, reflex exam, and sensory exam were normal. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any other neurologic abnormalities associated with her thoracolumbar spine. 

Initially, the Board notes that in order to be successful on a claim for service connection, either direct or secondary, the Veteran must possess a current disability. Here, the record is devoid of any documented diagnosis of either a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability or eczema scars. The treatment records are silent for a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability and eczema scars. Therefore, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted on either a direct or secondary basis for either a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability or eczema scars.

As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report symptoms pertaining to her eczema scars and bilateral lower extremity nerve disability. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). The Board finds her accounts to be credible as they are corroborated by the record. The Veteran denied any scars related to her eczema, and neither the March 2021 nor January 2023 examiners observed scarring on her head, face, or neck. Additionally, during the January 2023 examination, the Veteran denied any radiating pain associated with her service-connected lumbosacral strain. Furthermore, the March 2021, January 2023, and February 2024 examiners did not diagnose the Veteran with a bilateral lower extremity disability. The Board finds the Veteran's lay statements to be competent and credible. Therefore, the Board affords the Veteran's lay statements along with the March 2021, January 2023, and February 2024 examiners' opinions probative value. 

Thus, the weight of the competent and credible evidence indicates that the Veteran did not manifest either a diagnosis of a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability or eczema scars during service or within one year of separation from service nor continuous of symptoms after separation. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

The Board is persuaded against the Veteran's claims for service connection for a bilateral lower extremity nerve disability and eczema scars. Accordingly, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims are denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
