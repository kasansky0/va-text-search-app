ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for narcolepsy is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's narcolepsy is due to her service-connected Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for narcolepsy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from October 1992 to February 1995 and with the Air Force National Guard from February 1995 until February 2016.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2022 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for narcolepsy

The Veteran contends narcolepsy is secondary to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability that is due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The August 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran is diagnosed with narcolepsy.

In a March 14, 2025 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD with alcohol use disorder, rated at 100 percent disabling, effective March 7, 2020. This decision is not evidence but rather a legal determination that the Board may consider regardless of the fact that it occurred outside the evidentiary windows.

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion from Dr. M. S.  He opined that The Veteran's narcolepsy is at least as likely as not the direct result of her PTSD.  He provided the rationale that PTSD often causes daytime somnolence, excessive somnolence, distressing dreams, and/or hallucinations just prior to falling asleep.  All the above symptoms are seen with a higher prevalence than normal in patients with PTSD.  Many neurologists believe that PTSD can cause narcolepsy as the body's way of dealing with the hyperstimulation, which is so prevalent in PTSD. In patients with PTSD, the hypothalamus is intimately involved either by overstimulation or an attempt by the body to shut down the hypothalamus due to its extreme role in mediating emotions.  It is known that PTSD increases the odds of REM sleep disorder parasomnias, thus resulting in extremely poor sleep quality and subsequent hypersomnia during the day.

The Board finds while Dr. M. S. provides an adequate and probative opinion linking the Veteran's narcolepsy to the now-service-connected PTSD.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding service connection for narcolepsy is due to her service-connected PTSD. The claim is granted.
