REFERRED

Whether there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the May 30, 2019, Rating Decision which denied a 100 percent rating for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) is referred to the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for allergic rhinitis.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The May 2019 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a TBI was not timely appealed and no new and relevant evidence was received within one year of that rating decision; the Veteran next filed an intent to file on February 7, 2022, followed by a completed application seeking service connection for TBI on March 8, 2022.

2. The Veteran's residuals tibial plateau fracture, right knee, is manifest by pain on motion and flexion limited to, at worst, 135 degrees including after repetitive use over a period of time.

3. The Veteran's sciatic radiculopathy, left lower extremity, is manifest by symptoms comparable to no more than mild incomplete paralysis.

4. The Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery measures 5 cm long and 0.2 cm wide with a total area of 1 square cm.

5. It was first ascertainable on February 7, 2022, that the Veteran's status post degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine with IVDS, was manifest by forward flexion of 30 degrees or less; at no point during the period on appeal was the Veteran's status post degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine with IVDS, manifest by unfavorable ankylosis or the equivalent.

6. The Veteran's seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis and autoeczematization reaction required use of topical therapy and was manifest by visible characteristic lesions that covered less than five percent (5%) of total body area and of the exposed body area.

7. The Veteran's allergic rhinitis was not manifest by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis, complete obstruction on either left or right due to rhinitis, permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, nasal polyps, or any granulomatous condition.

8. The May 2019 rating decision granting service connection and assigning a zero percent evaluation for a scar on the left long finger was not timely appealed and no new and relevant evidence was submitted within one year; it was not first ascertainable at any time prior to February 7, 2022, that the scar was painful. 

9. The January 2020 rating decision assigning a 10 percent evaluation for headaches was not timely appealed and no new and relevant evidence was submitted within one year; it was not first ascertainable at any time prior to February 7, 2022, that the Veteran's headaches were manifest by characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months or greater symptoms.

10. The Veteran filed an initial claim for, among other conditions, "irritable colon syndrome" but withdrew that claim in February 2017; the Veteran next filed an intent to file on February 7, 2022, followed by a completed application seeking service connection for IBS on March 8, 2022.

11. It was first ascertainable on February 7, 2022, that the Veteran's gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was manifest by two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.

12. The Veteran's GERD/IBS does not result in dysphagia or symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health. He reports 5-8 bowel movements per day, with frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, but without weight loss or malnutrition, serious complications, or general health effects due to IBS.

13. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2000 to March 2001, from May 2003 to March 2007, from February 2011 to January 2017, and from January 2017 to March 2019.

VA's modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies to this matter.

The Veteran submitted an April 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss, entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for "TBI/PTSD", and entitlement to an increased rating for migraine headaches which were most recently addressed in an August 2022 rating decision and requested readjudication of entitlement to increased rating claims for back, low back scar, IBS/GERD, skin disabilities, left lower extremity radiculopathy, scar of the middle finger, rhinitis, and right knee and entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction which claims were most recently addressed in an April 2022 rating decision.  

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a July 2023 supplemental claim decision, which confirmed and continued the evaluations for the back condition, the back scar, radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, the right knee condition, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), the skin condition, and allergic rhinitis; denied earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder and traumatic brain injury (TBI), migraine headache, and a scar on the left middle finger; and confirmed and continued the previous denials of service connection for erectile dysfunction (ED) and hearing loss. 

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a September 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 2023 rating decision.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the January 2024 HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 supplemental claim decision.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and/or based on the need for aid and attendance, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

VA regulations provide that, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1). That regulation does not indicate that the claimant is entitled to pre-decisional notice of this optional hearing. In fact, 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1) provides that, following a decision, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief... [including] the right to a hearing on any issue involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d) of this section...." Read together with § 3.103(d), the only notice § 3.103(b) requires is that a claimant be provided notice of the right for a hearing with notification of the decision (by definition, a post-decisional notice). In November 2022, VA amended VA Form 21-526EZ and in May 2024 VA amended VA Form 20-0995 to inform claimants of the right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  The claims in this appeal were filed on a VA Form 20-0995 prior to the amended version. However, the Board finds that any error in the failure to inform the Veteran of the right to a pre-decisional hearing before the Regional Office (RO) was harmless error. 

In Bowen, the Court found that when a claimant is denied a hearing before the RO, there is no due process violation if he is subsequently offered the opportunity for a hearing before the Board, even if a hearing was not requested or conducted, as long as there is no violation of due process concerning the Board hearing opportunity. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253-4 (2012). The facts in the case can be differentiated on several levels, to include that the Veteran did not actually request an RO hearing and the issue in Bowen was not one of notice. Regardless, the Board cannot find a basis to conclude that the underlying holding and logic of the Bowen case would not lead to the same finding of no prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case. The July 2023 notification letter informing the Veteran of the rating decision included a VA Form 20-0998, Your Right to Seek Review of Our Decision, outlining the Veteran's appeal options, to include a hearing before the Board. Additionally, in the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran was provided with an option to request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge. The Veteran instead selected direct review by a Veterans Law Judge and the form explicitly states that by choosing this option, the Veteran does not want a Board hearing. Because the Veteran was provided with notice of the right to appeal to the Board, as well as the right to a Board hearing, there was no due process violation in the processing of the claim or any suggestion that the Veteran was prejudiced by the failure of VA to provide a hearing at the RO level. See Bowen.

Referred Issues/Issues Not on Appeal

Briefly, the Board will explain the basis for the above characterizations of the claims on appeal and why some claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates listed in the VA Form 10182 are not properly before the Board, as well as the basis for referring claims to the AOJ.

For a number of claims, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing the rating evaluation and effective date (GERD/IBS, right knee, left lower extremity radiculopathy, back, back scar, skin, allergic rhinitis).  These claims are all characterized as increased rating claims above because the effective date for the award of service connection is not at issue, other than as noted and discussed further below. As the AOJ noted in the January 2024 rating decision, the effective dates are not at issue because no review request was filed within one year of the rating decision which awarded service connection for these disabilities, so the effective dates are final. See May 2019 rating decision (awarding service connection for GERD, right knee, left lower extremity radiculopathy, back, back scar, and skin). The assignment of an appropriate rating must take into account the proper date to award that rating, and the Board has done so below.

However, the effective date for the award of service connection for allergic rhinitis was properly appealed. Allergic rhinitis was granted service connection in an April 2022 rating decision, with notice on April 13, 2022.  Therefore, the April 2023 supplemental claim expressing disagreement with the effective date was timely. This issue is REFERRED to the AOJ, since it was not addressed in the July 2023 or January 2024 rating decisions. 

Similarly, entitlement to service connection for IBS was first claimed in March 2022 (following a February 7, 2022, intent to file) and was awarded in the April 2022 rating decision and the effective date assigned was appealed in the April 2023 supplemental claim.  The AOJ adjudicated that claim in the January 2024 HLR decision on appeal, amending the effective date for the award of service connection for IBS to February 7, 2022.  So the claims on appeal do include entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for IBS.

The Veteran appealed the effective date for the left long finger and for migraines.  These claims seek an earlier effective date for the assignment of the higher ratings assigned in the April 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran filed his supplemental claim within one year of that rating decision, so has continuously pursued the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for compensable ratings for migraines and the scar of the left long finger.  However, the effective dates for the award of service connection for the migraines and scar of the left long finger are not at issue.  See May 2019 and January 2020 rating decisions.

In the September 2023 Brief in Support of HLR, the Veteran's representative argued for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  The January 2024 HLR decision granted entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and no aspect of that issue was appealed in the February 2024 VA Form 10182.

Finally, the September 2023 Brief in Support of HLR contains argument in favor of a higher rating for PTSD with TBI and, in the February 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran attempted to appeal the "rating evaluation & effective date" for "PTSD w/ TBI."  However, there is no PTSD claim at issue in this appeal.  As noted above, the April 2023 supplemental claim sought review of claims denied in April 2022 and August 2022 rating decisions. The August 2022 rating decision granted service connection for TBI and combined it with the 70 percent rating for PTSD that had been in effect since 2019. The supplemental claim sought review of only "Effective Date - TBI/PTSD."  Consequently, the supplemental claim did not raise the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD, for TBI, or for the now combined PTSD with TBI.  The July 2023 supplemental claim decision on appeal then adjudicated entitlement to "an earlier effective date for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder and traumatic brain injury (TBI)" (in acknowledgement that the conditions are assigned a single rating because the symptoms cannot be separated).  The September 2023 VA Form 20-0996, HLR request sought to appeal the evaluation and effective date for "mental health condition/TBI."  The January 2024 HLR decision stated that "the evaluation assigned for posttraumatic stress disorder with traumatic brain injury residuals was decided in the rating decision dated August 27, 2022, and your request for higher level review was received on September 19, 2023."  The AOJ concluded that the HLR request was untimely as to the evaluation assigned for PTSD with TBI and, so, that issue would not be addressed.  The Board agrees.  The attempt to appeal the evaluation was only made in the HLR request which was untimely as to any rating decision actually addressing the appropriate rating for PTSD or TBI (e.g., the August 2022 rating decision).  Again, no such issue was raised in the April 2023 supplemental claim giving rise to this appeal, so a higher rating for PTSD/TBI was not adjudicated in the July 2023 supplemental claim decision on appeal.  Therefore, the issue of the proper rating for PTSD/TBI is not currently before the Board. The Veteran can file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) for a higher rating if he wishes to do so.

Finally, in the September 2023 Brief in Support of HLR, the Veteran's representative raised the issue of whether there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the May 30, 2019, Rating Decision which denied a 100 percent rating for service-connected PTSD and MDD.  The Veteran argues that the March 2018 VA examination "clearly and unmistakably shows total occupational and social impairment" and, so the failure in the May 2019 rating decision to assign a 100 percent rating constitutes CUE.  As of this Board decision, the AOJ has not adjudicated that claim of CUE, so the issue of whether there was clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the May 30, 2019, Rating Decision which denied a 100 percent rating for service-connected PTSD and MDD is referred to the AOJ for initial adjudication.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI)

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for TBI.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995 (appealing the effective date for "TBI/PTSD" in the August 2022 rating decision); August 2022 Rating Decision (awarding service connection for TBI effective March 8, 2022); July 2023 Supplemental Claim Decision (awarding an effective date of February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for PTSD with MDD and with TBI residuals).  The Veteran and his representatives have not presented argument why the effective date should be earlier than February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for TBI.

Unless otherwise provided, the effective date for an award of compensation for service-connected disability shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  The effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The date of receipt of a claim is the date on which a claim, information, or evidence is received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  A "claim" is defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  Under 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim after notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  After notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  After notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  After a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2), if a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued a notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.

The Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for TBI that was received March 8, 2018. See March 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ.  That claim was denied in a May 2019 rating decision.  The Veteran filed an August 2019 VA Form 20-0996, Request for HLR, and the AOJ issued a September 2019 HLR decision again denying the claim.  The Veteran did not submit new and relevant evidence within a year of that decision and did not timely file a notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) or a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), so the May 2019 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

The Veteran next filed a claim for service connection for TBI that was received on March 8, 2022.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ..  The Veteran had previously filed a February 2022 VA 21-0996, Intent to File.  Because the intent to file was received within one year prior to the March 2022 claim, the effective date of the claim was the date VA received the intent to file:  February 7, 2022.

The March 2022 claim was granted in an August 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran timely filed an April 2023 VA Form 20-0995 challenging the March 8, 2022, effective date.  In the January 2024 HLR decision in this appeal stream, the AOJ granted an effective date of February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for TBI (combined for rating purposes with PTSD).

February 7, 2022, is the correct effective date for the award of service connection for TBI as that is the earliest date of claim after which the Veteran continuously sought an earlier effective date.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for TBI residuals is denied.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for residuals tibial plateau fracture, right knee

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his residuals tibial plateau fracture, right knee (hereinafter "right knee disability").  The claim giving rise to this appeal was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for the right knee disability which arose out of a March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022 is the date of claim for the increased rating claim for the right knee.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of the continuously pursued claim), to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."), 3.2500(h).

The Veteran's right knee disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260, for limitation of flexion of the leg. Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for the right knee disability. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that the Veteran has impairments related to running, walking when carrying weight, stairs, and ladders would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees. 

The April 2022 VA examination documented the Veteran's subjective complaints, including complaints of functional limitations including impairments related to running, walking when carrying weight, stairs, and ladders, but also his report that he did not have flare-ups of the right knee.  The examiner measured full extension and 140 degrees of flexion of the right leg.  Active and passive ranges of motion were identical.  There was no evidence of pain or of crepitus.  There was objective evidence of localized tenderness posteriorly lateral described as "4/10" severity.  The Veteran was able to complete repetitive use testing with no additional loss of range of motion.  The examiner indicated that procured evidence indicated that pain, fatigability, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time.  The examiner estimated the limitation of flexion as 135 degrees after repeated use over time.  The procured evidence did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups, including because the Veteran specifically denied flare-ups.  There were no additional factors contributing to disability.  There was no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, no recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, no ligament tear, no recurrent patellar instability, and no recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, or any other tibial or fibular impairment.  The Veteran did not have a current meniscus condition.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the right knee disability.  Imaging of the right knee showed trace effusion.  The Veteran's right knee disability impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks including walking, running, standing, and lifting due to pain in the right knee.  The Veteran reported losing 1 week or less of work in the last 12 months.

Available treatment records are consistent with the April 2022 VA examiner's findings and do not weigh in favor of assigning a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's right knee disability.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

The Veteran does not have ankylosis of the right knee, so no rating under Diagnostic Code 5256 is warranted.  In making this finding, the Board has also considered whether the Veteran's subjective complaints of functional limitations would more closely approximate those associated with ankylosis, but finds that they do not.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 10-11 (2021) (noting 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permit an evaluation based on ankylosis if a claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis).  The findings regarding limitations of motion even after repetitive use over a period of time and the VA examiner's opinions are persuasively against finding that the Veteran's functional limitations more closely approximate ankylosis and the Veteran's subjective complaints also do not support finding that his functional limitations of the right knee more closely approximate ankylosis.

The April 2022 VA examiner specifically found that the Veteran did not have recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, or patellar instability of the right knee based on physical examination findings supporting that conclusion and the Veteran's failure to report any subjective history of instability or recurrent subluxation or the right knee, so no rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 is warranted.

The VA examiner found that the Veteran did not have any disability related to dislocated semilunar cartilage and the evidence does not support finding that the Veteran had "locking", pain, and effusion into the joint.  See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 366 (2007) (use of conjunctive "and" indicates all criteria must be met).  The Veteran had very modest limitation of motion but no locking, some pain, and "trace" effusion, none of which was due to problems with the Veteran's semilunar cartilage.  The absence of locking and the fact that the Veteran did not have symptoms related to his semilunar cartilage each provide an independent basis to conclude that no rating is warranted for the knee under Diagnostic Code 5258.  In addition to the fact that the Veteran does not have symptoms related to the semilunar cartilage, to include symptomatic removal thereof, the Veteran's symptoms of pain and limitation of motion are already rated as 10 percent under DC 5260, so an additional rating under Diagnostic Code 5259 would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); see also VA Gen. Coun. Prec. 9-2004 (Sep. 17, 2004) ("[T]he key consideration in determining whether rating under more than one diagnostic code is in order is whether the ratings under different diagnostic codes would be based on the same manifestation of disability or whether none of the symptomatology upon which the separate ratings would be based is duplicative or overlapping.").  Further, the Veteran would not benefit from changing from DC 5260 (which fully an adequately encompasses the Veteran's symptoms) to DC 5259 (which provides no higher rating and is a less appropriate diagnostic code given the actual diagnosis and findings related to the Veteran's knee).

The Veteran has full extension and his painful motion is fully compensated under DC 5260, so no higher or additional rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 5261.

The Veteran had no impairment of his tibia or fibula and did not have genu recurvatum, so no rating under Diagnostic Code 5262 or Diagnostic Code 5263 is warranted.

In making the above findings, the Board is cognizant of the fact that the Veteran has used medication, including "Aleve prn", to treat his overall musculoskeletal disability pain, to include knee pain. The Court has held that in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). More recently, the Court stated that the "the Board [is] obligated to discount the beneficial effects of the medication taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity of those disabilities" and held that "Jones applies in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant [diagnostic code] does not reference medication as a factor in evaluation." Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025). 

The Board notes, however, that neither Jones nor Ingram address how the Board is to discount the beneficial effects of medication, particularly when used as treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms and where examiners do not reasonably have the ability to assess range of motion both with and without use of medication. Remanding this appeal to order an addendum medical opinion based on Jones and Ingram, and in the lens of the rating criteria under § 4.71a, would almost certainly require an examiner to engage in medical speculation and would result in a medical opinion that lacks the degree of certainty to ascertain, even under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard, the impact of the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of a veteran's musculoskeletal disability in terms of range of motion. See, e.g., Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2005) (medical opinions that are speculative have "little probative value"). Significantly, one of the judges in McCarroll, joined by another judge in concurrence, expressed the same concern as to the implications of the holding in Jones: 

The requirement that the Secretary "may not consider the relief afforded by [a veteran's] medication when" applying the rating schedule, as Jones demands...invites medical speculation in trying to guess what a veteran's symptoms might be without the medication, or medical malpractice in the cessation of medication so that the veteran's symptoms without medication might be recorded. The former invites non-helpful guesswork by medical practitioners,...and the latter raises, at a minimum, serious ethical concerns that no court should encourage. That Jones essentially requires the Board to consider whether a medical examination is required to determine how serious a veteran's symptoms would have been in an alternate reality in which he or she was not taking his or her required medication should alone demonstrate the fallacy of the Jones holding.

McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 278 (2016) (internal citations omitted). Because it is highly unlikely that remand to obtain a medical opinion as to the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's right knee disability would result in a probative, non-speculative opinion as to such, the Board does not wish to further delay adjudication of the Veteran's appeal to engage in likely unfruitful further development pursuant to Jones and Ingram. Moreover, the Board certainly cannot - and will not - order the Veteran to stop taking medication to undergo an examination that would reflect the severity of his right knee disability without the use of pain medication. This would not only be cruel and potentially damaging to the Veteran, but the undersigned finds it would be legally unethical to ask such.  Finally, the Board does not read the examination report in this case as indicating the Veteran was using over-the-counter pain medication (i.e. Aleve) at the time of the April 2022 VA examination.  

In addition, the examiner provided opinions regarding the additional functional limitations after repetitive use over time and his findings do not suggest the examiner only considered the limitations that would be present after use of medication, but, as the Board interprets the report, opined on the most severe limitations experienced by the Veteran which, presumably, would occur without taking medication.

Finally, the Board notes that VA compensation does not contemplate hypothetical symptoms or impairment. Instead, the purpose of VA benefits is to compensate for decreased earning capacity - to compensate for actual symptoms or impairment that an individual experiences in the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. The Veteran's manifestations of pain have been considered in rating his right knee disability, but it still remains the Board's obligation to rate the condition based on the application of the rating criteria found in the diagnostic codes to the objective medical evidence. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for the service-connected right knee disability. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

3. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for sciatic radiculopathy, left lower extremity

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.  The claim was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from April 3, 2022, to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."). 

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  (Neuritis and neuralgia of that group are evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 8620 and 8720.).  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

Neuritis, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. Tic douloureux, or trifacial neuralgia, may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124.

The VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1MR) is not binding on the Board. However, the Board must address relevant provisions of the M21-1 and conduct an independent analysis before determining whether the provisions may be relied upon as a factor to support its decision. Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a directs decision-makers to assign the evaluation corresponding to mild or moderate degree of impairment where the peripheral nerve disability is only manifested by sensory impairment.  Under M21-1 Section V.iii.12.A.2.b., the mild level of evaluation is more appropriate where symptoms are:

"	Recurrent but not continuous,

"	Assigned a lower medical grade reflecting less impairment, and/or

"	Affect a smaller area in the nerve distribution

 The moderate level of evaluation is appropriate for the most significant and disabling cases of sensory-only involvement, including where the sensory symptoms are:

"	Continuous,

"	Assigned a higher medical grade reflecting greater impairment, and/or

"	Affect a larger area of nerve distribution

The primary evidence regarding the extent and severity of the Veteran's disability of the sciatic nerve of the left lower extremity during the period under consideration is the April 2022 VA examination.

The April 2022 VA examiner found no impairment of motor function (muscle strength was normal throughout the lower extremities), there were no trophic changes, sensory examination was normal throughout the lower extremities, reflexes were normal, there was no muscle atrophy, and the Veteran did not have complete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.  The examiner diagnosed radiculopathy of the lower left extremity affecting the sciatic nerve.  The Veteran had no constant pain, but did have mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness of the left lower extremity. The Veteran described his radicular symptoms as shooting pain down the left leg during flare-ups once per week lasting 12-24 hours.

Available VA treatment records do not provide any indication that the Veteran's symptoms or functional impairments are more severe than indicated by the April 2022 VA examination.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the disability is primarily manifest by mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness, though not revealed on sensory examination.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disability is manifest by impairment of motor functions, trophic changes, loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis.  The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to mild incomplete paralysis.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for scar, status post lumbar surgery

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his scar, status post lumber surgery.  The claim was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for the scar, status post lumbar surgery, which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022 is the date of claim.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of the continuously pursued claim), to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."), 3.2500(h).

The Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery, is rated under Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802, was for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that were superficial and nonlinear.  Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7802 instructed that a superficial scar was one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Id.  

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Diagnostic Code 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018, amendments.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery, is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  The April 2022 VA examination (Scars DBQ) revealed a stable scar of the lumbar spine region present since 2016.  The examiner indicated that the scar was not painful, was not tender to palpation, was stable, did not have underlying tissue damage, and did not have frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The examiner measured the scar as 5 cm long and 0.2 cm wide with a total area of 1 square cm.  These results do not meet the criteria for a compensable rating under DC 7802.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  However, the Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery, is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and non-linear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Moreover, the Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery, is not unstable or painful.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, and 7804, both prior to and from August 13, 2018, are inapplicable.  Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under both pre- and post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, but the Veteran has not submitted any statements regarding additional symptoms or impairments of the scar of the lumbar region.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Importantly, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the Veteran's scar, status post lumbar surgery, is manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for scar, status post lumbar surgery.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 20 percent prior to February 7, 2022, and in excess of 40 percent thereafter, for status post degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine, with IVDS

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his back disability, particularly including a 40 percent rating effective February 7, 2021.  See September 2023 Brief in Support of Higher-Level Review Appeal.  The claim was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for status post degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine with IVDS, which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022, is the date of claim.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of the continuously pursued claim), to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."), 3.2500(h).

The Veteran's status post degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine with IVDS (hereinafter "back disability") is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code DC 5242-5243.  

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012).  Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Id.  at Note 5.  The Board has also considered whether the Veteran's subjective complaints of functional limitations would more closely approximate those associated with ankylosis, but finds that they do not.  Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 10-11 (2021) (noting 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permit an evaluation based on ankylosis if a claimant's functional loss is consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for the back disability prior to February 7, 2022.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, lack of endurance, incoordination, repetitive use, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that his symptoms, particularly during flare-ups and after repetitive use over time, affect his ability to bend over, lift, twist, navigate stairs, and perform some activities of daily living would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  This is particularly so where the Veteran's statements to this effect were first documented by the April 2022 VA examiner and do not reflect any definite date of onset prior to April 2022.  VA has assigned an effective date for an increase based, in part, on the statements of February 7, 2022, the date of claim.  The Board finds this is appropriate as, presumably, the Veteran's statements would apply at least to his symptoms as of the date of his claim for an increase.

The criteria for awarding an increased rating prior to the date of claim is whether an increase in disability warranting a higher rating was first factually ascertainable within the one year prior to the date of claim.  Here, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Veteran's more serious symptoms and functional limitations began sometime prior to his claim and, more importantly, there is no basis to pick any particular date within the one year prior.  The Veteran's representative argues that the 40 percent rating should be awarded effective February 7, 2021, precisely one year prior to the date of claim.  See September 2023 Brief in Support of Higher-Level Review Appeal.  However, the representative cites no evidence and makes no specific argument why it would have been factually ascertainable on February 7, 2021, that the Veteran's back disability had increased sufficient to warrant a rating in excess of 20 percent.  There is no factual basis on which the Board could pick any other specific date from February 7, 2021, to February 6, 2022, (dates inclusive) for finding that the Veteran's back disability had increased in severity sufficient to warrant a rating in excess of 20 percent.

Therefore, the Board finds that the April 2022 VA examination provides no basis for a rating in excess of 20 percent prior to February 7, 2022.  Moreover, VA treatment records from the period February 2021 to February 2022 note pain, but do not indicate that the Veteran had limitation of motion beyond that which would warrant a 20 percent evaluation and which was reflected in the 2022 VA examination.  For example, a June 2021 VA Primary Care Note documents the Veteran's report of various types of pain including back pain, but the notes on physical examination indicate only: "back pain, tenderness upon palpation."  The examiner notes the back condition is being treated with NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and that the Veteran has no loss of bowel/bladder function and no perineal numbness.  The record fails to reflect any complaints of functional limitations related to the back or any measured or observed loss of range of motion.  Another June 2021 VA Nursing Note documents back pain characterized as "aching, sharp, shooting, soreness" with onset more than five years ago and use of non-opioid medication to alleviate symptoms.  However, the severity of the pain, functional impacts, and loss of range of motion (if any) were not discussed.  The treatment records are otherwise silent for any documentation of either the Veteran's subjective reports of functional loss from which an appropriate rating could be discerned or physical examination findings relating to loss of range of motion or functional impairments.  Again, VA has assigned an effective date of February 7, 2022, based on the findings of the April 2022 VA examination and giving the benefit of the doubt that his February 7, 2022, claim was an implicit assertion that those symptoms existed at the time of claim.  There is no other date which the Board could plausibly pick as constituting the date the Veteran had onset of symptoms and, therefore, from which it would be factually ascertainable that he met or more closely approximated the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent.

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes for the period prior to February 7, 2022.  However, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating prior to February 7, 2022.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  The only evidence prior to that date addressing the issue is the January 2020 VA examination which indicated that the Veteran did not have any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician in the past 12 months. Treatment records during the period do not support finding that the Veteran had any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician in the past 12 months.  Moreover, the April 2022 VA examination also affirmatively indicated that the Veteran had not had any episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to IVDS that required bedrest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician in the past 12 months (i.e., from April 2021 to April 2022).  Consequently, there is no basis for assigning a rating in excess of 20 percent prior to February 7, 2022, pursuant to DC 5243 (relating to IVDS).

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the finding the Veteran's back disability warranted a rating in excess of 20 percent prior to February 7, 2022, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at 1364; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

As to the period beginning February 7, 2022, the evidence of record is persuasively against any rating in excess of 40 percent. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, excess fatigability, lack of endurance, incoordination, repetitive use, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that his symptoms, particularly during flare-ups and after repetitive use over time, affect his ability to bend over, lift, twist, navigate stairs, and perform some activities of daily living would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

The April 2022 VA examiner documented the Veteran's report of flare-ups of the back disability once per week, lasting 12-24 hours, characterized by increased shooting pain in the back and down the left leg.  Precipitating factors were bending over, lifting, twisting, using stairs, performing ADLs, or doing chores.  Pain was described as 8/10 and, during flare-ups, the Veteran was impaired in bending over, lifting, twisting, using stairs, performing ADLs, and doing chores.  The examiner also noted additional functional loss of impairment after repeated use over time (with the same list of impairments as for flare-ups).  Forward flexion was measured as 30 degrees and the Veteran had measurable range of motion in every other aspect with combined range of motion of 105 degrees.  There was pain on all aspects of range of motion.  Passive range of motion was identical to active range of motion.  There was evidence of pain that caused functional loss related to bending over, lifting, twisting, stairs, and ADLs.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus but there was objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue described as "tender, sore" at the left lumbar.  Severity was 3/10.  The Veteran's fear of pain prevented repetitive use range of motion testing.  The examiner opined that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, and incoordination would reduce flexion to 25 degrees and combined range of motion to 80 degrees with repetitive use over time and to 20 degrees forward flexion and to 65 degrees of combined range of motion during flare-ups.  The Veteran had localized tenderness which did not result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour and did not have guarding or muscle spasm.  Muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation of the lower extremities was normal.  The Veteran did not have ankylosis or any other neurological abnormalities.

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  As already noted above, the April 2022 VA examiner found that the Veteran was not prescribed bed rest by a physician during the 12 months preceding the examination.

Regarding neurological impairment, the Veteran has already been granted service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity (the rating for which is separately addressed above) and the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability.

The VA examiner's findings indicate limitations which meet, but do not exceed the criteria for a 40 percent rating.

In making the above findings, the Board is cognizant of the fact that the Veteran has used medication, including "Aleve" (which the Board notes is an over-the-counter NSAID), to treat his overall musculoskeletal disability pain, to include back pain. The Court has held that in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones, 26 Vet. App. 56. More recently, the Court stated that the "the Board [is] obligated to discount the beneficial effects of the medication taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity of those disabilities" and held that "Jones applies in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant [diagnostic code] does not reference medication as a factor in evaluation." Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025). 

The Board notes, however, that neither Jones nor Ingram address how the Board is to discount the beneficial effects of medication, particularly when used as treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms and where examiners do not reasonably have the ability to assess range of motion both with and without use of medication. Remanding this appeal to order an addendum medical opinion based on Jones and Ingram, and in the lens of the rating criteria under § 4.71a, would almost certainly require an examiner to engage in medical speculation and would result in a medical opinion that lacks the degree of certainty to ascertain, even under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard, the impact of the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of a veteran's musculoskeletal disability in terms of range of motion. See, e.g., Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2005) (medical opinions that are speculative have "little probative value"). Significantly, one of the judges in McCarroll, joined by another judge in concurrence, expressed the same concern as to the implications of the holding in Jones: 

The requirement that the Secretary "may not consider the relief afforded by [a veteran's] medication when" applying the rating schedule, as Jones demands...invites medical speculation in trying to guess what a veteran's symptoms might be without the medication, or medical malpractice in the cessation of medication so that the veteran's symptoms without medication might be recorded. The former invites non-helpful guesswork by medical practitioners,...and the latter raises, at a minimum, serious ethical concerns that no court should encourage. That Jones essentially requires the Board to consider whether a medical examination is required to determine how serious a veteran's symptoms would have been in an alternate reality in which he or she was not taking his or her required medication should alone demonstrate the fallacy of the Jones holding.

McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 278 (2016) (internal citations omitted). Because it is highly unlikely that remand to obtain a medical opinion as to the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's back disability would result in a probative, non-speculative opinion as to such, the Board does not wish to further delay adjudication of the Veteran's appeal to engage in likely unfruitful further development pursuant to Jones and Ingram. Moreover, the Board certainly cannot - and will not - order the Veteran to stop taking medication to undergo an examination that would reflect the severity of his back disability without the use of pain medication. This would not only be cruel and potentially damaging to the Veteran, but the undersigned finds it would be legally unethical to ask such.  Moreover, the Board does not read the examination report in this case as indicating the Veteran was using over-the-counter pain medication (i.e. Aleve) at the time of the April 2022 VA examination but that he would use it when necessary such as during flare-ups.  

In addition, the examiner provided opinions regarding the additional functional limitations after repetitive use over time and his findings do not suggest the examiner only considered the limitations that would be present after use of medication, but, as the Board interprets the report, opined on the most severe limitations experienced by the Veteran which, presumably, would occur without taking medication.

Finally, the Board notes that VA compensation does not contemplate hypothetical symptoms or impairment. Instead, the purpose of VA benefits is to compensate for decreased earning capacity - to compensate for actual symptoms or impairment that an individual experiences in the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. The Veteran's manifestations of pain have been considered in rating his back disability, but it still remains the Board's obligation to rate the condition based on the application of the rating criteria found in the diagnostic codes to the objective medical evidence.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 40 percent for the back disability.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

6. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis and autoeczematization reaction

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis and autoeczematization reaction (hereinafter "skin disability").  

The claim was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for the skin disability, which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022, is the date of claim.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of the continuously pursued claim), to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."), 3.2500(h).

The Veteran's skin disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 7806, for seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis and autoeczematization reaction.  

Effective August 13, 2018, VA regulations explicitly state that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a).

Additionally, effective August 13, 2018, a new General Rating Formula for the Skin applies to Diagnostic Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Under this formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.  A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC's 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating for the Skin for DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.  

Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that the predominant disability is dermatitis.  The March 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran uses topical therapy for dermatitis (but not the other skin conditions) and the Veteran's dermatitis and dermatophytosis were the only conditions with visible characteristic lesions and both covered less than five percent (5%) of total body area and of the exposed body area.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation because the Veteran's skin disability does not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the skin disability covered an area or required therapy which more nearly approximates the criteria in the next higher rating.

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the skin disability would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for the skin disability.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

7. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to higher ratings for his allergic rhinitis, but has not provided specific argument or identified evidence in support of this contention.

Allergic rhinitis is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522 (allergic or vasomotor rhinitis).  Under DC 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for rhinitis with polyps.

The March 2022 VA examination documented the Veterans' report that in the Fall and Spring, he would have itchy eyes and runny nose. The examiner diagnosed rhinitis and physical examination revealed that there was no greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides due to rhinitis, there was no complete obstruction on either left or right due to rhinitis, there was not permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, there were not nasal polyps, and the Veteran did not have any granulomatous conditions.  The condition did not affect the Veteran's ability to work.

These findings do not support a compensable rating.  The VA treatment records do not reveal symptoms or physical examination findings relating to the diagnosed rhinitis which would meet or more nearly approximate the criteria for any compensable rating.

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for rhinitis.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

8. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of a 10 percent rating for painful scar, left long finger

The Veteran seeks entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of a 10 percent rating for painful scar, left long finger.  The Veteran currently has a noncompensable rating prior to February 7, 2022, and a 10 percent rating thereafter.  The claim was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for the scar, left long finger, which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022 is the date of claim.  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), the effective date of an increase in a veteran's disability compensation 'shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) provides an exception to this general rule: "The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date."

Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of an increased rating earlier effective date case:

(1) If an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1));

(2) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)); or

(3) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims under 38 C.F.R. 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014). The amendments apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015. Because the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date was filed after March 24, 2015, the claim must have been on a standard form.

In addition, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.

Here, service connection for a scar on the left long finger was initially granted with a zero percent evaluation effective March 17, 2019.  See May 2019 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not submit new and relevant evidence within a year of that decision and did not timely file a notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) or a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), so the May 2019 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

The Veteran next filed a claim for an increased rating for the scar that was received in March 2022.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022, is the date of claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  The 10 percent rating granted by the AOJ was made effective date of claim. The question then is whether it was first ascertainable that the Veteran was entitled to a 10 percent rating during the period February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of claim) and February 7, 2022 (the date of claim and the effective date for the 10 percent rating).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d at 982-84.

The Veteran's scar of the left long finger is rated under Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802, was for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that were superficial and nonlinear.  Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7802 instructed that a superficial scar was one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Id.  

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Diagnostic Code 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018, amendments.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 10 percent rating.  Three or four scars that are unstable or painful scars warrants a 20 percent rating.  Five or more scars that are unstable or painful warrants a 30 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7804 instructs that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Id.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802, because the Veteran's scar of the left long finger was not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.  

The April 2022 VA examination (Scars DBQ) revealed a stable scar of the left middle (long) finger present since 2013.  The examiner indicated that the scar was painful (described as "tender"), was tender to palpation, was stable, did not have underlying tissue damage, and did not have frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  The examiner measured the scar as 0.5 cm long and 0.2 cm wide with a total area of 0.1 square cm.  

These results meet the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7804 (one painful scar).  It was first ascertainable that the Veteran's scar of the left long finger met the criteria for a compensable rating on the date of the VA examination which was in April 2022.  The date of claim for an increased rating was February 7, 2022.  Giving the Veteran the benefit of every doubt, the 10 percent rating was warranted as of February 7, 2022, but no earlier.  This is what the AOJ assigned.

Treatment records and other evidence reflecting the period prior to February 7, 2022, do not indicate findings similar to those of the April 2022 VA examination which support a 10 percent rating and do not otherwise indicate symptoms or features of the scar of the left long finger from which it would be ascertainable that a 10 percent rating is warranted under either DC 7802 or 7804.

The Board has also considered whether it was first ascertainable that the Veteran's scar warranted a 10 percent rating under any of the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars.  However, the Veteran's scar of the left long finger is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and non-linear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  Moreover, the Veteran's scar of the left long finger is not unstable.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7801, both prior to and from August 13, 2018, are inapplicable.  Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under both pre- and post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for en effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for a 10 percent rating prior to February 7, 2022, for scar of the left long finger.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of a 10 percent rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

9. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than February 7, 2022 for the award of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches.  

The increased rating claim for migraine headaches was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for migraine headaches which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022 is the date of claim.  

The law concerning effective dates and provided above and incorporated here by reference. 

Here, service connection for migraine headaches was initially granted with a 10 percent evaluation effective March 17, 2019.  See January 2020 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not submit new and relevant evidence within a year of that decision and did not timely file a notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) or a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), so the January 2020 rating decision became final.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

The Veteran next filed a claim for an increased rating for migraine headaches that was received on March 8, 2022.  See March 2022 VA Form 20-0995.  The Veteran had previously filed a February 2022 VA 21-0996, Intent to File.  Because the intent to file was received within one year prior the March 2022 claim, the effective date of the claim was the date VA received the intent to file:  February 7, 2022.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The March 2022 increased rating claim was granted in an April 2022 rating decision which awarded a 50 percent rating effective February 7, 2022.  The bases for the rating are the findings in the March 2022 VA examination (Headache DBQ).  There was no other VA examination during the relevant period.

The question is whether there is evidence from which it is first ascertainable that the Veteran's migraine headaches warranted a rating in excess of 10 percent sometime between February 7, 2021 (the date one year prior to the date of claim for the continuously pursued increased rating claim), and February 7, 2022 (the currently assigned effective date).

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, for migraine.  Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

VA treatment records document complaints of migraines, including increased severity, but do not indicate the frequency of the migraine headaches or provide sufficient detail regarding the increased symptoms such that it was ascertainable a rating in excess of 10 percent was warranted at some point between February 7, 2021, and February 7, 2022.  See June 2021 VA Progress Note ("Complaints of chronic headaches. . . States lights and noise bothers him. . . States headaches will last 15-20 minutes."; "Denies worse headache ever. Will schedule for brain CT scan s/t increase severity of headaches.").  The record does not reveal any evaluation of the Veteran's migraine headaches that note symptom severity or frequency which would meet the criteria for any rating in excess of 10 percent.  For example, while the June 2021 primary care note indicated the migraines had become more severe, it did not indicate any symptoms other than those noted in 2019 VA examinations and did not indicate the frequency of the migraine headaches, particularly including the frequency of characteristic prostrating attacks.  Therefore, there is no evidence upon which to find the Veteran met the criteria for any higher rating for migraine headaches prior to the March 2022 VA examination.  The AOJ gave the Veteran the benefit of every doubt in assigning the February 7, 2022, effective date for the 50 percent rating.

February 7, 2022, is the correct effective date for the award of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches as that is the earliest date of claim after which the Veteran continuously sought an earlier effective date.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches is denied.

10. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for IBS.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995 (appealing the effective date for "IBS/GERD" in the April 2022 rating decision); April 2022 Rating Decision (awarding service connection for IBS effective March 22, 2022); January 2024 HLR Claim Decision (awarding an effective date of February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for GERD with IBS).  The Veteran and his representatives have not presented argument why the effective date should be earlier than February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for IBS.  (Note: Service connection for GERD was granted in a May 2019 rating decision that became final and, so, entitlement to an earlier effective date for GERD is not part of this appeal.)

Unless otherwise provided, the effective date for an award of compensation for service-connected disability shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  The effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

The date of receipt of a claim is the date on which a claim, information, or evidence is received by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  A "claim" is defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.  Under 38 C.F.R. §3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim after notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  After notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  After notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  After a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2), if a supplemental claim is received more than one year after the date on which the agency of original jurisdiction issues notice of a decision or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued a notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.

The Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for "colon syndrome, irritable" in August 2016.  See August 2016 VA Form 21-526EZ.  That claim was withdrawn in February 2017.  See February 2017 Report of General Information (documenting the Veteran's withdrawal of his pending claims because he was currently on active service); February 2017 VA Correspondence (documenting the withdrawal and notifying the Veteran of time limit to dispute withdrawal or the procedural to reinitiate a claim).

The Veteran next filed a claim for service connection for IBS that was received on March 8, 2022.  See March 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The March 2022 claim was granted in an August 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran timely filed an April 2023 VA Form 20-0995 challenging the March 8, 2022, effective date.  In the January 2024 HLR decision in this appeal stream, the AOJ granted an effective date of February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for IBS (combined for rating purposes with GERD), in recognition of the fact t he Veteran had previously filed a February 2022 VA 21-0996, Intent to File. The Board concludes February 7, 2022, is the correct effective date for the award of service connection for IBS, as that is the earliest date of claim after the Veteran's withdrawal of the prior 2016 claim.

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the claim, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 7, 2022, for the award of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is denied.

11. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for his service-connected GERD with IBS.  He has specifically argued in favor of the higher 10 percent rating to be effective February 7, 2021.  The increased rating claim for GERD with IBS was received on April 3, 2023.  See April 2023 VA Form 20-0995.  This was within one year of the April 2022 rating decision adjudicating an increased rating claim for GERD with IBS which arose out of the March 2022 supplemental claim.  As noted above, a February 7, 2022, intent to file preceded the March 2022 supplemental claim, so February 7, 2022 is the date of claim.  Therefore, the period on appeal with respect to this claim runs from February 7, 2021, (one year prior to the date of the continuously pursued claim), to July 18, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o) ("Earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim."), 3.2500(h).

The Veteran's GERD with IBS is rated by analogy to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346, for hiatal hernia. Prior to May 19, 2024, GERD was not specifically listed in the rating schedule. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20 (when an unlisted condition is encountered it will be permissible to rate under a closely related disease or injury in which not only the functions affected, but the anatomical localization and symptomatology are closely analogous).

Pursuant to DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

It was first ascertainable on February 7, 2022, that the Veteran's GERD with IBS first manifested in two or more symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  The evidentiary basis for this is the March 2022 VA examination and the February 7, 2022 claim (from which date VA has assumed that the Veteran's lay contentions documented in the report on the VA examination relate).  

The March 2022 VA examiner noted persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, sleep disturbance caused by reflux, nausea (four or more times per year lasting less than one day), and vomiting (four or more times per year lasting less than one day).  The condition affected the Veteran's ability to work due to gagging with acid reflux which would require him to "walk away to vomit."  He missed 0-1 weeks of work in the last 12 months due to the condition.  These symptoms meet the criteria for a 10 percent rating but not for any higher rating.

VA treatment records prior to February 7, 2022, do document complaints of GERD, but, during the appeal period prior to February 7, 2022, the records only documented "more burning" (i.e. pyrosis), but no other symptoms such as dysphagia, regurgitation, or substernal, arm, or shoulder pain.  See June 2021 VA Progress Note ("More GERD even with taking Prilosec. States he has more burning and states his medication is not working.").  The treatment records do not otherwise indicate symptoms included in the 30 percent criteria or that the Veteran's condition was productive of considerable impairment of health.

Consequently, it was not ascertainable prior to February 7, 2022, that the Veteran had two or more symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  It was not factually ascertainable until February 7, 2022, that the 10 percent rating was the appropriate rating, as the Veteran's symptoms were not productive of considerable impairment of health.  See March 2022 VA Examination.

As noted above, February 7, 2022, is the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection for IBS. Therefore, the symptoms of IBS cannot be considered prior to that date for the purpose of determining whether a compensable rating was warranted prior to that date; only the GERD symptoms can be considered. The next highest rating is not warranted because his symptoms have not resulted in considerable impairment of health. "Considerable" is not defined within 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  When interpreting a regulation, the words should be given their ordinary meaning. See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018). "Considerable" is defined as "significant" or "large in extent or degree." See Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/considerable. 

As for whether a rating higher than 10 percent is warranted for GERD with IBS, the Board finds it is not. He can be rated under either DC 7346 for the GERD symptoms or DC 7319 for the IBS symptoms, whichever results in a higher rating. He cannot, however, receive separate ratings per VA's regulations. 

The criteria for GERD are given above. The 30 percent rating criteria includes conjunctive provisions, which thus specifically require, in part, the existence of dysphagia, and there is no evidence, either lay or medical, to suggest that the Veteran experienced dysphagia at any part during the appeal period. Moreover, the 2022 VA examiner did not check the box indicating that the Veteran's symptoms of GERD were/are productive of considerable impairment of health. The VA examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements and the evidence and determined, from a medical perspective, the evidence did not show considerable impairment of health, as she did not check that box when listing the signs and symptoms of the Veteran's GERD.

As for rating his symptoms as IBS, under DC 7319, a 20 percent rating is warranted for abdominal pain related to defecation for at least three days per month during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.

The March 2022 VA examination diagnosed IBS and documented the Veteran's report of 5-8 bowel movements per day.  The examiner noted frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress.  The Veteran did not have weight loss or malnutrition, serious complications, or general health effects of the IBS.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the IBS.  The examiner indicated that the condition did not affect the Veteran's ability to work. These examination findings did not indicate that the Veteran met or more nearly approximated the criteria for a higher rating under DC 7319.

There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved. The Veteran's GERD did not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a compensable rating prior to February 7, 2022.  As the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7346 were not met prior to February 7, 2022, a noncompensable rating was warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. As for a rating higher than 10 percent from February 7, 2022, for the GERD with IBS, the evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran met or more nearly approximated the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent on or after February 7, 2022.  The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

12. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The determination of whether a veteran has a disability based on hearing loss is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a hearing loss disability for VA purposes and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The most recent audiological examination was conducted in March 2018.

On the authorized audiological evaluation in March 2018, pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 15	15	10	15	15

LEFT	20	20	20	20	10

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and of 96 percent in the left ear.

These audiological results are persuasively against finding that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes.  

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of hearing loss, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires the ability to conduct and interpret complicated diagnostic audiological testing.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The Veteran was scheduled for more current VA examinations to evaluate his hearing loss claim on April 12, 2022, June 4, 2022, August 9, 2022, and August 25, 2022, but failed to appear for those VA examinations.  The Veteran has not argued that he had or provided evidence of good cause for failure to attend four scheduled audiological examinations.  Consequently, the Board must decide the claim on the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655.

The evidence is not in approximate balance, but is persuasively against the claim, therefore there is not reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Duties to Notify and Assist

This appeal is being adjudicated under the modernized system (AMA).  The reasons for remand by the Board in the modernized review system are limited to correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

The Veteran has not raised any specific issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist, much less any pre-decisional errors or errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).  Therefore, the Board does not need to discuss VA's compliance with the duties to notify and assist.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) or based on the need for aid and attendance is remanded.

Prior to the July 2023 rating decision on appeal, the record contained evidence which raised the issue of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) or based on the need for aid and attendance.  Specifically, the Veteran applied for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers based on an alleged (1) inability to perform an activity of daily living; or (2) a need for supervision, protection, or instruction.  See March 2022 VA Progress Note (Caregiver Certificate).  The AOJ did not adjudicate the issue of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) or based on the need for aid and attendance which was reasonably raised in a March 15, 2022 VA progress note and encompassed within the April 2023 claim of entitlement to higher ratings.

The failure to adjudicate the reasonably raised claim of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) or based on the need for aid and attendance constitutes a pre-decisional failure to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (allowing the Board to remand for correction of any other error by the RO in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

After any indicated development has been completed, readjudicate the issue of entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and/or based on the need for aid and attendance.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
