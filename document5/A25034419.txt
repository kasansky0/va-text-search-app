ORDER

An effective date of October 22, 2015, for the grant of service connection for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (initially claimed as undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War service) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War from January 1991 to April 1991.

2. The Veteran's currently diagnosed IBS, which manifested to at least some degree prior to December 31, 2026, is presumed to be associated with his Southwest Asia service. 

3. On October 22, 2015, the Veteran submitted an intent to file; and within one year, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War service; in a November 12, 2019 rating decision, issued under the Appeals Modernization Act review system, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim of service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War, and the Veteran has continuously pursued that claim by submitting supplemental claims with new and relevant evidence within a year of each subsequent rating decision that denied a claim of service connection for a gastrointestinal disorder until a July 2023 rating decision granted service connection for IBS, effective from August 10, 2022.  

4. The Veteran's undiagnosed illness, manifested by chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain (and eventually diagnosed as IBS), is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that arose while on active-duty service in Southwest Asia and has continued since.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 22, 2015, for the grant of service connection for IBS have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1117, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.317, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1990 to March 1995.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a July 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In the July 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for IBS and assigned an initial 10 percent disability rating, effective from August 10, 2022.  The February 2024 HLR rating decision increased the initial disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected IBS from 10 percent to 30 percent disabling and continued the initially assigned effective date of August 10, 2022.

In a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket and specifically identified disagreement with the effective date of the award of service connection for IBS.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying July 2023 AOJ rating decision which was the subject of the February 2024 AOJ HLR rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for IBS.

The Veteran's attorneys assert that an effective date of October 22, 2015, is warranted for his grant of service connection for IBS because he has continuously pursued his claim for an undiagnosed illness related to the Gulf War (eventually diagnosed as IBS) since the VA received his intent to file on that date.

Generally, the effective date for an award based on, inter alia, an original claim of service connection shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application thereof.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of the receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of service connection shall be the day following the date of discharge or release if application is received within one year from such date of discharge or release.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If a formal claim is received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a), the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), is applicable to all claims or requests for readjudication of finally decided claims for which VA issues notice of a decision on or after the effective date of the AMA.  The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 19.2(a).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a new supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1).  Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(2).

The first question before the Board is whether the Veteran established continuous pursuit of his claim from October 22, 2015, to the present appeal.

In this case, the RO received a VA 21-0996 Intent to File on October 22, 2015.  Less than one year later, on October 21, 2016, the RO received a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim, claiming entitlement to service connection for any and all mental disorders and entitlement to service connection for an undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War Service.  

In November 2016, the Veteran was notified that no further action would be taken on his October 2016 claim in light of the RO's November 22, 2004, administrative decision that determined the Veteran was not entitled to VA benefits due to a bad conduct discharge.  In July 2017, the Veteran filed a legacy notice of disagreement (NOD).  In August 2018, after challenging the character of his discharge, the Veteran received an updated DD-214 reflecting a general discharge under honorable conditions.  In September 2019, the VA sent the Veteran a letter advising him that his discharge was now considered honorable for VA purposes.  In light of this change, the RO began to develop the October 2016 claim and sent the Veteran a request for additional information regarding the illnesses he was claiming were related to Gulf War service.  

Notably, the Veteran characterized his initial claim for service connection in October 2016 as "Undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War Service," presumably because the Veteran's service treatment records refer to a history of Gulf War Syndrome.  It is therefore reasonable to infer that the Veteran believed that in claiming service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War Syndrome (the diagnosis he was given), the Veteran was seeking, at least in part, service connection for his gastrointestinal symptoms (later diagnosed as IBS) as a manifestation of Gulf War Syndrome.  

In a November 2019 rating decision, the RO denied the claim, characterizing it as service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War.  The Veteran received notification of the decision on November 12, 2019.  Regarding the gulf war illness claim, the RO noted that undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War are not recognized by the VA as a syndrome and that the Veteran did not provide information requested by the RO in a September 27, 2019, letter regarding the undiagnosed illnesses he claimed as related to his Gulf War Service.

On November 11, 2020, within one year of notification of the November 2019 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Supplemental Claim for service connection for gulf war illness.  With respect to his gulf war illness claim, the Veteran's attorney argued, in a November 2020 brief, that the Veteran has been examined on multiple occasions since service which have documented his symptoms, including chronic joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal issues, headaches, respiratory issues, and abnormal weight loss, but have been unable to give an affirmative diagnosis of any identifiable condition, despite multiple rounds of bloodwork and physical evaluation.  

In a March 2021 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD, effective November 11, 2020, but denied the claim for service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War service, finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  However, new evidence was added to the file, including compensation and pension exams conducted in March 2021 regarding his claim for gulf war illnesses and a private medical report from an examination of the Veteran by Dr. K, specifically regarding gulf war illness.  This evidence was discussed by the RO in the April 2021 rating decision, and the claim was adjudicated, but denied on the merits.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on April 5, 2021.  

On March 28, 2022, within one year of notification of the March 2021 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a request for a higher-level review of the March 2021 rating decision.  In April 2022, the higher-level reviewer continued the denial of service connection for undiagnosed illnesses related to Gulf War, finding that new and relevant evidence was received, but denied the claim on the merits.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on April 19, 2022.

On April 18, 2023, within one year of the April 2022 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for "gulf war illness (functional gastrointestinal disorder - IBS)".  

In a July 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for IBS, and assigned an initial 10 percent disability rating, effective from August 10, 2022.  The RO found that the Veteran was entitled to service connection for IBS as a manifestation of an undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 and 38 U.S.C. § 1117.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on July 14, 2023.

On October 5, 2023, the Veteran requested a higher-level review of the July 2023 rating decision, and his attorneys attached a brief arguing that an effective date of October 22, 2015 (the intent to file) is warranted because the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since that time. 

In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the initially assigned disability rating for the Veteran's IBS was increased to 30 percent, from the effective date of service connection, August 10, 2022; however, the AOJ denied an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection.  The RO found that the Veteran continuously pursued his claim for service connection for an undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War service since his October 22, 2015, intent to file.  However, the RO denied an earlier effective date, finding that there was no objective medical evidence confirming that a qualifying condition existed to link to the conceded qualifying service prior to the Veteran's April 2023 supplemental claim.  

As noted by the RO and discussed in greater detail above, the Veteran has indeed continuously pursued his claim by filing an appropriate review option to each rating decision.  Within one year of the November 2019 rating decision, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence.  Within one year of the subsequent April 2021 rating decision, the Veteran requested HLR of the April 2021 decision.  Within one year of the subsequent April 2022 HLR rating decision, the Veteran filed another supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence.  Service connection was then granted in the July 2023 rating decision.  Accordingly, the evidence shows the Veteran continuously pursued his claim of service connection for a gastrointestinal disorder, initially claimed as an undiagnosed illness due to gulf war syndrome, and currently diagnosed as IBS. 

The remaining question is when entitlement to service connection for IBS arose.  

The August 10, 2022, effective date of for the grant of service connection for IBS is the date of the enactment of PL 117-168 (PACT Act), which amended 38 U.S.C. § 1117 to establish a presumption of service connection for undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic multi-symptoms illnesses (MUCMI) manifesting to any degree at any time after qualifying service, as opposed to manifesting by a certain time period.

The Veteran filed his claim for service connection in October 2015 - prior to the enactment of the PACT Act in August 2022.  At that time, in order for a Persian Gulf War veteran's qualifying chronic disability to be presumed related to qualifying service in Southwest Asia, the disability needed to manifest while on active duty in Southwest Asia, or to a degree of 10 percent or more disabling prior to December 31, 2016.  38 U.S.C. § 1117 (2015); 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (2015).  

Additionally, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (2015), except as otherwise provided, VA will pay compensation in accordance with chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, to a Persian Gulf veteran who exhibits objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability, provided that such disability: (i) Became manifest either during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2016; and (ii) By history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.

(2)(i) For purposes of this section, a qualifying chronic disability means a chronic disability resulting from any of the following (or any combination of the following): (A) An undiagnosed illness; (B) A medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms, such as:  (1) Chronic fatigue syndrome; (2) Fibromyalgia; (3) Functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding structural gastrointestinal diseases).

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are a group of conditions characterized by chronic or recurrent symptoms that are unexplained by any structural, endoscopic, laboratory, or other objective signs of injury or disease and may be related to any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Specific functional gastrointestinal disorders include, but are not limited to, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional vomiting, functional constipation, functional bloating, functional abdominal pain syndrome, and functional dysphagia. These disorders are commonly characterized by symptoms including abdominal pain, substernal burning or pain, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits (including diarrhea, constipation), indigestion, bloating, postprandial fullness, and painful or difficult swallowing. Diagnosis of specific functional gastrointestinal disorders is made in accordance with established medical principles, which generally require symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis and the presence of symptoms sufficient to diagnose the specific disorder at least 3 months prior to diagnosis.  Additionally, by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis.  

Qualifying disabilities include signs or symptoms of a MUCMI.  38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(2)(b) (2015) states that symptoms of a MUCMI could include chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  38 C.F.R. § 3.317 describes symptoms of a MUCMI, which include: fatigue, signs or symptoms involving skin, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, neurological signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms, sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight loss, and menstrual disorders.  Following the PACT Act, the qualifying disability is eligible for the presumption of service connection when it manifests to any degree at any time.  38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.  

Accordingly, the Veteran's IBS would warrant service connection prior to August 10, 2022, (PACT act) if there was a showing that his IBS manifested while on active duty or to a degree of 10 percent or more by December 31, 2016. 

With his original October 2016 claim, the Veteran submitted treatment records immediately prior to discharge which show he complained of, and was diagnosed with, gulf war syndrome.  April 1995 (immediately after active-duty service), treatment progress notes show the Veteran reported constant abdominal pain and underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EDG) which found redness, swelling, and small raised dots of reddened mucosa in the stomach, but the Board is unable to locate any medically explained, diagnosis based on those findings.  Post-service private treatment records show the Veteran continued to complain of abdominal pain in October 2016.  In a brief submitted by his attorney representative at the time, it was asserted that the Veteran suffered from a number of undiagnosed illnesses associated with service in the Gulf War, including gastrointestinal symptoms.  

VA treatment records show that in January 2019, Veteran complained of a history of chronic diarrhea in which he had at least 2-3 loose bowel movement per day for years.  

The medical report from Dr. K received in November 2020 shows that the Veteran reported onset of diarrhea in April 1991 (immediately after his service in Southwest Asia).  He said that he did not seek medical attention for diarrhea at that time.

In sum, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, later diagnosed as IBS (which is medically unexplained), including chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain, which were determined to be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War service, were present at the time the Veteran was on active duty and continued to a degree of at least 10 percent since that time.  As the symptoms manifested on active duty, the Veteran meets the criteria for presumptive service connection pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1117 (2015) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 (2015) on October 22, 2015.  Therefore, the Veteran was entitled to service connection for IBS (originally claimed as undiagnosed illness related to Gulf War) at the time the Veteran filed his intent to file, which was followed within one year by his completed original claim for undiagnosed illnesses due to Gulf War Syndrome.  In short, the date of the October 22, 2015 Intent to File, is the latter of the date of claim, and the date entitlement arose.  As the earliest effective date available is the later of the date entitlement arose or the date of claim, the earliest effective date available for the Veteran's claim for IBS is the intent to file - October 22, 2015.

Accordingly, the assignment of an effective date of October 22, 2015, for the grant of service connection for IBS is warranted.
