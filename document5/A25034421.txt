DOCKET NO. 241003-479678
ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a skin condition, variously diagnosed as dermatitis and eczema, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's skin condition was incurred in service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for a skin condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 1110; 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1991 to March 1991, from February 2003 to June 2004, from February 2005 to February 2008, from March 2008 to October 2012, and from November 2012 to April 2013.  He appeals a September 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that denied service connection for a skin condition.

The Veteran requested that his appeal be placed on the direct review docket.  See October 2024 VA Form 10182.  Under the direct review docket, the Board is only authorized to review the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's September 2024 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301.

Entitlement to service connection for a skin condition

The Veteran seeks service connection for a skin condition.  To establish service connection, a claimant must show (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a causal relationship or "nexus" between the present disability and the in-service injury or disease.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran contends that he has had rashes periodically on his arms and behind his knees ever since he returned from deployment to Iraq.  See April 2023 statement.  His service treatment records show that he reported recurring rashes during service.  See September 2008, August 2009, May 2010 STRs.  

The Veteran was given a VA examination in May 2023, in which the examiner noted a 2008 diagnosis of "contact dermatitis and eczema, status post."  See May 2023 VA examination.  The examiner concluded that a nexus to service could not be established because the Veteran did not "currently have any active dermatitis/eczema."  Id.  The examiner, however, did not explain why the lack of any active dermatitis would be determinative given the reportedly periodic nature of the Veteran's condition.  

The record contains an opinion from the Veteran's treating physician who has seen the Veteran for eczema/atopic dermatitis since 2017.  See March 2024 medical opinion.  The physician noted the Veteran's record of in-service treatment for periodic rashes as well as his reports that he continued to have exacerbations of this condition regularly for years and was self-treating with steroid creams.  Id.  She attributed the absence of any active symptoms at the time of the May 2023 VA examination to the Veteran's use of prescribed medication.  Id.  She then concluded that the Veteran's condition likely began while he was in service in 2008 and that it will require lifelong treatment.  Id.  

In July 2024, the AOJ obtained an additional medical opinion which purported to review the conflicting medical evidence.  The clinician concluded that the Veteran's current eczema was less likely than not related to his service, relying on a lack of records of medical treatment between the 2010 report and the 2017 diagnosis.  See July 2024 VA medical opinion.  The clinician did not, however, discuss the Veteran's reports of recurrent symptoms during that time.  

The Board finds the VA opinions of record to be inadequate.  The initial VA opinion does not explain why the absence of active eczema at the time of the examination should be determinative, especially given that the Veteran was using prescribed medication at the time.  The second opinion bases its conclusion on a lack of documentation of treatment between 2010 and 2017, but does not take note of the Veteran's lay statements concerning his symptoms and treatment throughout this time.  See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016) (the examiner must consider the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms).

On the other hand, the physician's opinion takes account of the Veteran's lay statements and provides a clear conclusion and rationale.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).  The Board is thus persuaded by the physician's opinion, and concludes that service connection for a skin condition is warranted.
