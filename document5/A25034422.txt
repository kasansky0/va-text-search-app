ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on aid and attendance is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A May 2023 rating decision denied entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with May 2023 rating decision and appealed the issue to the Board. 

2. In an August 2024 Board decision, entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance was granted.

3. In a March 2025 Board decision, the Board vacated the August 2024 decision that granted entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance and in the same decision granted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance at the intermediate rate between the (m) and (n) rates.

4. These Board decisions addressed the issue of entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance; as such, the Board will dismiss the duplicate docketed appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1957 to September 1960 and from April 1966 to April 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the April 29, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran, or representative, with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. §3.2501. If the evidence 

?

is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance is dismissed.

The May 2023 rating decision on appeal denied SMC based on aid and attendance. The Veteran appealed the decision in his April 2024 notice of disagreement.

In August 2024, the Board granted entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance and an August 2024 rating decision implemented the Board's grant.

In November 2024, the Veteran appealed the effective date for SMC as well as the level of SMC awarded.

In March 2025, the Board vacated the August 2024 decision that granted entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance and in the same decision granted entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance at the intermediate rate between the (m) and (n) rates.

The Board finds this to constitute a full grant of the issue of entitlement to SMC based on aid and attendance on appeal. At no time has either the Veteran or his representative indicated that entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance higher than at the intermediate rate between the (m) and (n) rates was warranted or sought. The Board finds no potential additional benefits that could stem from the instant appeal. The March 2025 Board decision therefore renders the Veteran's appeal as to the issue moot.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's appeal has been rendered moot by the subsequent grant of the March 2025 Board decision. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. As such, the Veteran's appeal for entitlement to 

?

SMC based on aid and attendance is dismissed as moot. See Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997) (noting that dismissal is the proper remedy to employ when an appeal has become moot).
