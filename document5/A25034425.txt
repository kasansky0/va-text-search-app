ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 31, 2020 for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability for service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The January 2021 rating decision which established service connection for a lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities was not appealed and became final.

2. The Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities prevented him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment from August 31, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a radiculopathy of the right lower extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

3. The criteria for an earlier effective date than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a radiculopathy of the left lower extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

4. The criteria for an earlier effective date of August 31, 2020 for a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from May 1966 to April 1969. His decorations include the National Defense Service Medal.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) which, in pertinent part, continued a 40 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability, continued 20 percent disability ratings for the Veteran's service-connected radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities, and awarded entitlement to a TDIU, effective December 7, 2023. In March 2025, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran's counsel submitted a statement with the VA Form 10182, waiving the due process protections afforded pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), including the Veteran's ability to change dockets. The Board appreciates the clarification submitted with the appeal and may proceed to adjudicate the issues.

Finality and Earlier Effective Dates

Decisions of the AOJ are final, subject to certain exceptions. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. These exceptions include when an appeal is timely filed, 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103; when new and material evidence is received within one year of a decision in VA's legacy appeals system, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a)-(b); when new and relevant evidence is received within one year of a decision in an AMA appeal, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; when relevant service department records are received, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c); and when a decision is revised on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. A motion of CUE in a prior rating decision to revise or reverse must be addressed in the first instance by the AOJ. See Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that Veterans are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim. The Court specifically held that, once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding earlier effective date claim in an attempt to overcome the finality of a decision. The Court reasoned in Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) that to allow such claims would vitiate the rule of finality. Earlier effective date claims must arise on appeal from the rating decision granting the disputed effective date. 

A TDIU is a form of increased rating claim, and, therefore, the effective date rules for increased compensation apply. See Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1999); Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). The effective date shall be the later of either the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). An effective date for a claim for increase may also be granted prior to the date of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred within one year from the date of the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(1), (2). Therefore, the ultimate question in determining the effective date for TDIU is when it was factually ascertainable that the service-connected disabilities rendered a veteran unemployable.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is denied.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is denied.

The Veteran maintains entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 6, 2020 for the award of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and for radiculopathy of his right and left lower extremities. He specifically argues that the effective date for these disabilities should be March 19, 2004, the date of his original claim for service connection. As resolution of these appealed issues is dependent on the timing of certain occurrences, the Board concludes that a brief recitation of pertinent facts would be helpful.

The Veteran first filed a claim of service connection for a lumbar spine disability on March 19, 2004. The Board notes that a claim for a lumbar spine disability necessarily includes any manifestations of such a disability, to include radiculopathy. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). This claim was denied in an August 2004 rating decision. That same month, the Veteran filed a valid notice of disagreement (NOD). However, the AOJ did not issue a statement of the case (SOC) regarding this issue in response to the Veteran's August 2004 NOD. Thus, the Veteran's August 2004 NOD remains unadjudicated.

On October 6, 2020, the Veteran filed another claim of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability. In a January 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for a lumbar spine disability and for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities, all effective October 6, 2020, the date of the claim. Significantly, the Veteran did not appeal the January 2021 rating decision, nor did he proffer new and relevant evidence within a year of its issuance. Thus, the January 2021 rating decision which established the effective date of service connection for these claims became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

On December 7, 2023, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to a TDIU, the basis of which included all of his service-connected disabilities. In September 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision which, in pertinent part, continued the then-current disability ratings for the Veteran's lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities. The Veteran then filed the VA Form 10182 which generated the instant appeal, seeking an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for these disabilities. Importantly, the September 2024 rating decision on appeal did not establish the effective date of service connection for these claims; this date was established in the January 2021 rating decision which has become final. 

As explained above, the Court has held that there can be no valid "freestanding" earlier effective date claim raised at any time after a rating decision becomes final. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300. The only means of establishing the claimed earlier effective date would be to establish CUE in the August 2004 rating decision. CUE is a specific challenge to a prior final decision and must be pled with specificity to the AOJ and adjudicated. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 333 (2006) (en banc). To date, no such claim involving an allegation of CUE in a pertinent prior decision regarding this matter is currently before the Board. The Board is bound by the laws and regulations of VA regarding finality of prior decisions. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.

Accordingly, absent an allegation of CUE addressed in the first instance to the AOJ, the Veteran's disagreement with the effective date of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities constitutes a freestanding claim and must be denied as a matter of law in light of Rudd. This decision, however, does not preclude the Veteran from filing a CUE motion if he so chooses. 

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of August 31, 2020 for a TDIU is granted.

The Veteran maintains entitlement to an effective date earlier than December 7, 2023 for the award of a TDIU. 

VA will grant a TDIU when the evidence shows that a Veteran is precluded, by reason of service-connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. TDIU benefits are granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining of gainful employment. If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for TDIU benefits; if there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

In addition, in Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019), the Court defined the term "unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation" as having two components: one economic and one noneconomic. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. The Court defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024). The non-economic component of Ray includes consideration of the following: the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the Veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.

The VA regulation defining eligibility for a TDIU is 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 as discussed above. This regulation, however, does not define the procedure by which a Veteran may claim a TDIU. Instead, VA practice and case law have defined two ways formal and informal. A formal claim exists when VA receives a VA Form 21-8940. An informal claim, in contrast, is created pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Rice holds that a claim for a TDIU is part and parcel of any open rating issue (initial or increased) when unemployability is expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record during the rating appeal, and it attaches for the entire rating period.

The Veteran was awarded service connection for a lumbar spine disability and for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities in a January 2021 rating decision. He was assigned an initial 40 percent disability rating for his lumbar spine disability, and initial 20 percent disability ratings per lower extremity for his radiculopathy, effective October 6, 2020. On March 9, 2021, within one year of the issuance of this rating decision, the Veteran filed the aforementioned VA Form 21-8940 application. Pursuant to Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims (March 13, 2025), this form may serve as a supplemental claim under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued higher initial disability ratings for his service-connected lumbar spine and radiculopathy disabilities. The evidence of record at the time of the grants of service connection and the assignment of the initial disability ratings included a November 2020 VA examination report that noted that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities would negatively impact employment. As such, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU was reasonably raised by the record in conjunction with these issues in accordance with Rice during the initial rating appeal. 

The Board finds that the Veteran has met the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU throughout the appeal period. The record reflects that the Veteran worked as a truck driver for decades, ending employment on August 31, 2020. The record does not reflect, nor does the Veteran argue, that his employment as a truck driver prior to August 31, 2020 was marginal, nor was it in a protected environment. 

Although not vocational experts, every Board member has experience in a work environment, so a Board member may draw upon common knowledge or general experience about work environments when assessing TDIU evidence. See Arline v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 238, 252 (2021). At the November 2020 VA examination, a VA examiner noted that the Veteran experiences pain and the limited ability to lift, carry, climb, stand, or walk, or bend or twist his back due to his service-connected lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities. Similar symptomatology was documented in the Veteran's VA treatment records and the April 2021 VA examination report. The Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities adversely affect his ability to perform physical or sedentary employment as he is unable to take on strenuous tasks or to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time. 

While the Board finds that the issue of a TDIU was raised by the record as part and parcel of the Veteran's increased disability rating claims for his service-connected lumbar spine disability and radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities, the Board may not award an effective date back to the original claim, as the record demonstrates that he was substantially, gainfully employed through August 31, 2020. Thus, the effective date for the Veteran's TDIU is most appropriately August 31, 2020, the date he ended employment.
