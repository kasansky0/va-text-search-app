DOCKET NO. 240523-442311
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The issues of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and service connection for OSA as secondary to his service-connected disabilities of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis has been withdrawn and is, therefore, dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a signed June 2024 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, the Board received a request from the Veteran for a withdrawal of this appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a withdrawal of the Veteran's substantive appeal have been met as to his service connection claim for OSA. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 2005 to January 2009.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection for OSA and service connection for OSA as secondary to the service-connected disabilities of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis.

Veteran filed a June 2024, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim stating "Please withdrawal Appeal Application to the Board of Veterans' Appeals dated May 23rd, 2024, for sleep apnea. Filing was a mistake on [his] end." In an October 2024 VA 27-0820, the Veteran further stated he did not want to continue with any more disability claims. In a March 24, 2025, VA 27-0820, the Veteran further stated the BVA claim should have been canceled and that he sent a VA 21-4138 to cancel the claim that was filed in error.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. In a June 2024, VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran withdrew this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
