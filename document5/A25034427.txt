REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from April 1970 to December 1971. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of a March 2018 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In a January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), under the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) disagreeing with the March 2018 decision, issued in the legacy appeals system. The Veteran requested the Hearing Review docket. The matter was improperly docketed as an appeal in the AMA appeals system.

In January 2025, a BVA NOD Clarification Letter was sent explaining that the January 2023 VA Form 10-182 did not meet the necessary procedural requirements to perfect an appeal to the Board.  It was also explained that if the Veteran disagreed with this determination, the Veteran was required to respond within 60 days of the date of the letter.  The Veteran did not respond within the requisite time period or otherwise disagree with the finding of a procedural defect with the January 2023 VA Form 10182.

In the legacy appeals system, a claimant must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. Otherwise, the rating decision will become final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52 (a), 20.1103. As such, the Veteran's attempt to appeal the March 2018 decision with the submission in January 2023 was invalid. Moreover, for the reasons already stated, the Form 10182 was an incorrect form to use. Nonetheless, the Veteran's "appeal" was improperly docketed in the AMA appeals system.

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that when a claimant appeals a decision governed by the legacy review system by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD), and it is improperly docketed at the Board under the AMA, the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. However, it may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons, such as a procedural defect. Additionally, in determining whether dismissal is appropriate, "the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors." Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333-34.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c).

The Board has noted the regulations governing the requirements for a timely appeal and the required form to be used. The Board concludes there are no factors, to include waiver and forfeiture, which would preclude dismissal of these claims under a processing defect of improper forms and, most significantly, the considerable passage of time since the March 2018 denial. Moreover, nothing in the record shows a request by the Veteran for an extension to appeal or good cause as to why he waited approximately 4 years to pursue again his claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b).

For the reasons stated, the Board finds the exceedingly late attempt to appeal the March 2018 denial, the manner and form of the filing and the improper docketing of the matter as an appeal in the AMA appeals system constitute a procedural defect. Therefore, on that basis, the appeal as docketed in the AMA system is dismissed.
