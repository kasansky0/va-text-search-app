ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence persuasively supports that a hearing loss disability did not originate in service or for many years thereafter and is not related to any incident during active service, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1967 to September 1969.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

1. Bilateral Hearing Loss

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the August 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the favorable findings for hearing loss included that: hazardous noise exposure in service was conceded; a claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to his military service; his sensorineural hearing loss can be service-connected if it was diagnosed to a compensable degree within a year of separation; he was diagnosed with a current disability, as at the August 2024 VA examination he was diagnosed with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss for VA purposes.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that this disability began during service or was otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include conceded noise exposure. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland (MD) CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As noted above, the favorable findings in the August 2024 rating decision found that the Veteran had a currently diagnosed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes based on the findings in the August 2024 VA examination. 

The favorable findings in the August 2024 rating decision also found that the Veteran's noise exposure in service was conceded. The Veteran's DD Form 214, DD Form 215, and his service personnel records (SPRs) reflect he served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War and received the Bronze Star medal, thereby supporting his statements of exposure to excessive noise during active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). 

Service treatment reports (STRs) demonstrate that the results of the audiometric testing in the January 1967 examination are as follows: 

			HERTZ		

					

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	0	0	0	-	0

LEFT	5	10	0	-	0

STRs demonstrate that the results of audiometric testing in the September 1969 examination are as follows:

			HERTZ		

					

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	5	0	0	-	5

LEFT	15	5	5	-	25

The September 1969 separation examination did not reflect any findings of abnormalities in the ears or eardrums, and the September 1969 Report of Medical History at separation revealed the Veteran checked the box "no" when answering whether he had or ever had hearing loss or ear, nose or throat trouble. 

The Board observes that there is no evidence of a nexus between the currently diagnosed hearing loss disability and the Veteran's active service. The evidence of record does not demonstrate any medical opinions relating the current disability to the Veteran's active service, and the medical evidence does not demonstrate a continuity of treatment or symptoms. 

A December 2019 private medical report reflects audiological testing demonstrated the Veteran had bilateral hearing loss in both ears that met the criteria for a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. In an August 2024 VA audiological examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears that met the criteria for a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. In this examination, the Veteran reported difficulty hearing in large groups and with background noise. The VA examiner concluded that hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by or the result of an event in military service. In her rationale, the VA examiner noted there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation, which is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise. She also found there was no report of complaints or treatment for hearing decrease in the STRs or at separation from active service. The VA examiner found that, although noise exposure was conceded and the relationship of noise, auditory damage and hearing loss was well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss were not conceded based on noise alone. She explained that there must be a nexus of auditory damage to relate current hearing loss to military noise and not another etiology. The VA examiner then concluded the evidence was against a nexus in this case, and therefore it was less likely than not that the hearing loss is related to military noise exposure. 

The Board observes that, in her rationale, the VA examiner considered the Veteran's report in the VA examination of hearing loss, his report of an onset of this disability in 1969, and the confirmation of noise exposure in active service. In formulating her opinion, it is clear the VA examiner considered this evidence along with the STRs and found the contemporaneous medical evidence of record did not support the report of an onset of hearing loss in 1969. Therefore, it is evident from her opinion that she afforded more weight to the medical evidence of record. 

While a Veteran is competent to report treatment and symptoms of a disorder, he is not competent to diagnose or medically attribute any in-service symptom or incident to a current disorder. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). In this case, the Veteran is competent to report a history of an onset of progressive hearing loss since 1969; however, he is not competent to relate his hearing loss disability to his active service, and specifically, to malaria medication he had taken during his active service. The issues are medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran to relate the current hearing loss disability to active service in this case, as such would constitute a medical conclusion, which the Veteran is not competent to make as a lay person and the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377; see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). 

Although the Veteran is competent to an onset of hearing loss since 1969, these statements are not credible as they are inconsistent the medical evidence of record. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In this regard, the Board observes that, in his June 2024 initial claim for service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus, the Veteran reported that these disabilities were caused by taking malaria medication in service and the onset of this disability was in September 1969. STRs and post-service medical evidence reflect initial complaints and treatment for low back pain were first documented in the June 2024 claim for service connection for hearing loss. Although the Veteran reported his hearing loss had its onset in September 1969, the Board observes that the September 1969 separation examination did not reflect any findings of abnormalities in the ears or eardrums, and the September 1969 Report of Medical History at separation revealed the Veteran checked the box "no" when answering whether he had or ever had hearing loss or ear, nose or throat trouble. Therefore, his post-service report of an onset of hearing loss in September 1969 is inconsistent with his statements in the September 1969 Report of Medical History and the September 1969 separation examination findings. Consequently, as the Veteran's statements regarding the onset of hearing loss in 1969 are inconsistent with his own reports of his health in the September 1969 Report of Medical History and the September 1969 separation examination findings, these statements are not credible lay evidence. Therefore, the Board gives more probative weight to the medical evidence of record. 

In this case, the VA examiner's opinion was based on examination of the Veteran, review of the claims file, consideration of lay statements, and an adequate rationale and is supported by the medical evidence of record. Therefore, it is afforded more probative weight over the competent but not credible lay statements of record.

As the evidence persuasively favors against the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
