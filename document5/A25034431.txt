ORDER

The appeal for the issue of entitlement to service connection for memory loss is dismissed.

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for left ear hearing loss is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss is denied. 

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a seizure disorder is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a sleep disorder, to include sleep apnea and hypersomnia, is remanded. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran filed a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Form 10182 in September 2022 in which he included the issue of entitlement to service connection for memory loss and identified a December 2021 rating decision. The record contains no appealable decision on that issue in December 2021 or in the preceding year.

2.  The Veteran's service-connected left ear hearing has been level I.

3.  The Veteran has not been shown to have right ear hearing loss for VA compensation purposes since he filed his claim or within close proximity thereto.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The appeal for the issue of entitlement to service connection for memory loss is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 5104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.104, 20.203.

2.  The criteria for an initial compensable evaluation for left ear hearing loss have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

3.  Right ear hearing loss was not incurred in active service, and right ear sensorineural hearing loss may not be presumed to have been so incurred. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2002 to April 2005.

In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, requesting higher level review (HLR) of December 2021 and March 2022 rating decisions.  In May 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 and March 2022 rating decisions.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in September 2022 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 and March 2022 rating decisions, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board could not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the issues of entitlement to service connection for a seizure disorder and a sleep disorder, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes that the appeal had also originally included the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  However, during the pendency of the appeal, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for that disability in an April 2023 rating decision.  The grant constitutes a full award of benefits sought on appeal. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F. 3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Therefore, the issue is no longer on appeal.

Law and Analysis

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the pre-decisional duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues decided herein. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board...to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Memory Loss

The Board has jurisdiction to make decisions in appeals on all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of VA under a law that affects the provision of VA benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  An appeal consists of a notice of disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 affecting the provision of VA benefits. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.203; see also 38 U.S.C. § 511.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In the September 2022 VA Form 10182, the Veteran included the issue of entitlement to service connection for memory loss and identified the decision date as December 2021.  However, the December 2021 rating decision did not adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for memory loss.  In fact, the AOJ most recently adjudicated that issue in a November 2017 rating decision.  Thus, there is no appealable decision for that issue in the one-year period preceding the September 2022 VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed due to this procedural defect.

Increased Evaluation

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation for his service-connected left ear hearing loss, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

In evaluating hearing loss, disability ratings are derived by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are performed. Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  Evaluations of hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity, as measured by controlled speech discrimination tests in conjunction with the average hearing threshold, as measured by puretone audiometric tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second.  The rating schedule establishes 11 auditory acuity levels designated from Level I for essentially normal hearing acuity through Level XI for profound deafness.

VA audiological evaluations are conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with the results of puretone audiometry tests.  The vertical line in Table VI represents 9 categories of the percentage of discrimination based on a controlled speech discrimination test.  The horizontal columns in Table VI represent 9 categories of decibel loss based on the puretone audiometry test. The numeric designation of impaired hearing (Levels I through XI) is determined for each ear by intersecting the vertical row appropriate for the percentage of discrimination and the horizontal column appropriate to the puretone decibel loss.  The percentage evaluation is found from Table VII by intersecting the vertical column appropriate for the numeric designation for the ear having the better hearing acuity and the horizontal row appropriate for the numeric designation for the level for the ear having the poorer hearing acuity.  For example, if the better ear had a numeric designation of Level V and the poorer ear had a numeric designation of Level VII, the percentage evaluation is 30 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 (includes Tables VI, VIA, and VII).

Regulations also provide that in cases of exceptional hearing loss, i.e., when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, the rating specialist will determine the numeric designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.86(b) provide that when the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz, the rating specialist will determine the numeric designation for hearing impairment from either Table VI or Table VIA, whichever results in the higher numeral. That numeral will then be elevated to the next higher numeral.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In considering the evidence of record under the law and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to an increased evaluation for his service-connected left ear hearing loss.

During a March 2022 VA audiological examination, the Veteran's puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

LEFT	 15	15	 15	45	23 

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the left ear.

Those audiometric findings equate to Level I hearing in the left ear in Table VI.  The application of those values to Table VII results in a noncompensable evaluation under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.

In summary, when the above values are applied to Table VII, it is apparent that the currently assigned evaluation is accurate and appropriately reflects the Veteran's left ear hearing loss under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  The examination findings also do not show an exceptional pattern of hearing loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 4.86.  The assigned evaluation is consistent with the mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned based on the audiometric evaluation performed, and the evaluation is based on the current VA law and regulations in effect for evaluating this disability. Lendenmann, supra. The Board has considered the lay statements of record as to the Veteran's hearing loss; however, the Veteran stated that his hearing was "pretty good" and denied having hearing difficulties during the March 2022 VA examination.  Moreover, his lay statements do not establish that he met the specific test results required for a higher evaluation, as required by the rating criteria.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a compensable evaluation for left ear hearing loss.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the appeal is denied.

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 368 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  As organic diseases of the nervous system, including sensorineural hearing loss, are considered to be chronic diseases for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In addition, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

For the purpose of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for right ear hearing loss.

The Veteran's service treatment records show that he reported having right ear pain in October 2002.  However, those records did not document any right ear hearing loss, and there were no other complaints pertaining to his right ear in service.

The evidence of record also does not demonstrate a current right ear hearing disability as defined by VA for compensation purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  In fact, a March 2022 VA audiological examination revealed puretone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 10	15	20	10	15

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 98 percent in the right ear.

Based on the foregoing, the March 2022 VA examination did not show that the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; that the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or that speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  Thus, the evidence does not establish a current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

There is also no other evidence showing that the Veteran has met the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 during the appeal period or within close proximity thereto.

The Board further notes the Veteran denied having hearing difficulties during the March 2022 VA examination and reported that his hearing is pretty good. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.

Because the evidence does not show that the Veteran has right ear hearing loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and discussion of the remaining elements is not necessary. See Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection).  As the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the appeal is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Upon review, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors with regard to the remaining issues on appeal.

Seizure Disorder

A November 2021 VA examiner found that the Veteran does not have or has never been diagnosed with a seizure disorder and opined that it is less likely than not that any seizure disorder that the Veteran has now is related to the episode that occurred in 2004.  The examiner explained that the Veteran has not been formally diagnosed with a seizure disorder and that he was not diagnosed with one in 2004. 

Nevertheless, the Board notes the Veteran was documented as having a pseudo seizure in March 2004 and partial epilepsy with impairment of consciousness without mention of intractable epilepsy in February 2005.  The examiner did not address those previous diagnoses.  Thus, it appears that the opinion was based on an incomplete or inaccurate factual premise. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based upon an incomplete or inaccurate factual premise has no probative value).  Therefore, the Board finds that an additional medical examination and opinion were needed. 

Sleep Disorder

The Board notes the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for a sleep disorder, to include hypersomnia. His service treatment records show that he was being seen for what was described as a sleep-deprived EEG (electroencephalogram) in February 2005, and he was later diagnosed with hypersomnia in August 2018 during a sleep consultation.  Therefore, the Board finds that a VA examination and medical opinion are needed. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any seizure disorder that may be present.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and assertions.

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the appellant, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has a seizure disorder that is causally or etiologically related to his military service, to include any symptomatology therein.  He or she should specifically address the documentation of a pseudo seizure in March 2004 and partial epilepsy with impairment of consciousness without mention of intractable epilepsy in February 2005.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

2.  The Veteran should be afforded a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of any sleep disorder that may be present.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.

The examiner is requested to review all pertinent records associated with the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records, post-service medical records, and assertions.

The examiner should note that the Veteran is competent to attest to matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.  If there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the appellant, the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has a sleep disorder, to include sleep apnea and hypersomnia, that is causally or etiologically related to his military service, to include any symptomatology therein.  He or she should specifically address the February 2005 service treatment indicating that the Veteran was sleep deprived and the August 2018 diagnosis of hypersomnia.

A clear rationale for all opinions should be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
