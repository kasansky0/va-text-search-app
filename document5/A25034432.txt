DOCKET NO. 240917-476529
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA is proximately due to his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for OSA have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1984 to August 1987.

He appeals a November 2023 rating decision by the VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In his September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See September 2024 VA Form 10182.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Veteran seeks service connection for OSA on a secondary basis.  Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Here, the Veteran has a diagnosis of OSA.  See November 2023 rating decision favorable findings.  He is service connected for an acquired psychiatric disorder, namely adjustment disorder with depressed mood.  See April 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran generally contends that his service-connected acquired psychiatric disorder caused or aggravated his OSA.  See, e.g., May 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted an private opinion by Dr. M.B.  She concluded that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's mental health condition has caused or aggravated the development of his OSA.  See June 2023 Dr. M.B. medical opinion.  She opined that the Veteran's service-connected mental health disability has contributed to his weight gain and obesity, reasoning that his psychiatric symptoms include chronic sleep impairment and disturbances in mood and motivation-these symptoms have caused the Veteran severe daytime fatigue and lack of motivation which has decreased his physical activity over the years.  As a result, he has struggled with obesity.  Dr. M.B. noted that obesity is a well-known risk factor for the development of OSA.  In sum, she concluded that the Veteran's "service-connected adjustment disorder with depressed mood has caused chronic fragmented sleep patterns and obesity, which in turn has caused the development of his OSA and continues to permanently aggravate the condition."  Id. 

The Board observes that while obesity is not itself a compensable disability, it can constitute an intermediate step in demonstrating service connection on a secondary basis.  Garner v. Tran, 33 Vet. App. 241, 247-48 (2021); Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 305-07 (2020).

The Board finds the opinion of Dr. M.B. highly probative.  She reviewed the medical evidence of record, discussed the Veteran's medical history in detail, addressed relevant medical literature, and provided a medical opinion supported by a well-reasoned rationale.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  Thus, the Board finds the positive medical opinion of record probative as to the nexus element in this particular case.  Given Dr. M.B.'s opinion regarding the relationship between the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder and OSA, to include a link between his weight gain caused by same, the Board finds that service connection for OSA is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
