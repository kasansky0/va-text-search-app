ORDER

Entitlement to recognition of the Veteran's mother, I.A., as his dependent parent is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the claim period, I.A.'s monthly income exceeded $400.00 per month and was sufficient to provide for her reasonable maintenance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to recognition of the Veteran's mother, I.A. as a dependent parent of the Veteran are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 102, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.250, 3.262.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1980 to May 1986, and from November 1994 to March 1998.

The matter on appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals from an April 2023 decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (RO), which denied recognition of the Veteran's mother as a dependent parent. The Veteran appealed the decision to the Board. In the June 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In a Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Any veteran who is entitled to disability compensation, and whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including for a dependent parent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. §3.4(b)(2).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.250 govern whether a parent may be classified as a dependent parent. This regulation provides that conclusive dependency of a parent (other than one who is residing in a foreign country) will be held to exist where the monthly income does not exceed: (1) $400 (U.S. dollars) for a mother or father not living together; (2) $660 (U.S. dollars) for a mother and father, or remarried parent and spouse, living together; (3) $185 for each additional "member of the family" as defined in paragraph (b)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(a)(1).

If an appellant's parent's income is found to exceed the monthly amounts stated 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(a)(1), dependency be determined on the facts of the case under the principles outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b). Dependency of a parent will be held to exist if the parent does not have an income sufficient to provide for her reasonable maintenance. "Reasonable maintenance" includes housing, food, clothing, medical care, as well as items beyond the bare necessities. "Reasonable maintenance" also includes other requirements reasonably necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living suitable to and consistent with the parent's reasonable mode of life.

In determining dependency of a parent for compensation purposes, all payments will be considered income as received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.262(e). Old age and survivor's insurance and disability insurance under title II of the Social Security Act will be considered income as a retirement benefit under the rules as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.262(e).

There is no specific dollar limitation on net worth (as opposed to income) that bars an otherwise eligible parent from being classified as a dependent parent. To the extent that the Veteran's parent has a net worth or estate and some part of such assets may be relevant to the analysis of whether the parent has sufficient income to provide for their own reasonable maintenance, the Board looked to 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.262-3.263 for guidance. The terms "corpus of estate" and "net worth" mean the market value, less mortgages or other encumbrances, of all real and personal property owned by the claimant except the claimant's dwelling and personal effects. 38 C.F.R. § 3.263(b).

In determining whether some part of the parent's estate should be consumed for his or her maintenance, consideration will be given to the amount of the parent's income together with the following: Whether the property can be readily converted into cash at no substantial sacrifice; life expectancy; number of dependents who meet the definition of a member of the family; and potential rate of depletion, including unusual medical expenses. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 3.263(d).

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities have been rated at least 30 percent disabling for additional dependency compensation throughout the appeal period.

In November, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21P-509 (Statement of Dependency of Parent) itemizing his mother's expenses. He reported that his mother received $800.00 of Social Security income a month. Her monthly expenses totaled $620.00, and included electricity, water, gas, cable, home repairs, and clothes. The Veteran noted that he helped with some of her bills. The Veteran also reported that his mother owned a residence that reportedly had a market value of $28,000.00.

Based on the record, the Board finds the evidence does not establish that I.A. is a dependent parent for conclusive dependency or based on the inability to provide reasonable maintenance. A.M.'s monthly income of $800.00 exceeds $620.00. Thus, her total in monthly income, clearly exceeded the threshold for "conclusive" dependency set forth at 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(a).

Since the Veteran's mother monthly income exceeds $400, dependency may still be established if the parent does not have an income sufficient to provide for her reasonable maintenance. The Veteran reported expenses totaling $620.00 on the November 2022 VA Form 21P-509. Reasonable maintenance includes not only housing, food, clothing, and medical care sufficient to sustain life, but such items beyond the bare necessities as well as other requirements reasonably necessary to provide those conveniences and comforts of living suitable to and consistent with the parent's reasonable mode of life. However, the Veteran has not indicated that his mother had any other expenses that would be necessary to provide her with the conveniences and comforts of living suitable to her mode of life, as described in 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b)(1). Based on the finances reported, I.A.'s monthly income of $800.00 exceeded her expenses. As her expenses totaling $620.00 are lower than the Veteran's mother's monthly income of $800.00, the Board is unable to find that she is unable to provide for her own "reasonable maintenance." Thus, the Board finds that she does not meet the criteria of "dependent parent."

Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to recognizing I.A. as a dependent parent of the Veteran pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.250(b) is not warranted.
