ISSUE

Entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1318.

ORDER

Entitlement Dependency and Indemnity Compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 is DENIED.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was not evaluated as totally disabled for service-connected disability for 10 continuous years immediately preceding his death.

2. The Veteran was not totally disabled from the date of his discharge for a period of not less than 5 years immediately preceding his death.  

3. The Veteran was not a former prisoner of war.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1318; 38 C.F.R. § 3.22.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1979 until April 1982 and September 1984 until September 1988.  The Veteran died on [REDACTED], 2021, and the Appellant is his surviving spouse. 

This matter come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2022 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the January 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2022 RO decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the RO issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

The Board has reviewed all evidence of record regardless of whether it is discussed in detail in the Decision.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal).

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

I.

Legal Criteria - Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Benefits 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1318, VA death benefits may be paid to a deceased veteran's surviving spouse, parents, or children in the same manner as if the veteran's death was service-connected, even though the veteran died of non-service-connected causes, if the veteran's death was not the result of his or her own willful misconduct and at the time of death, the veteran was receiving, or was "entitled to receive," compensation for service-connected disability that (1) was continuously rated as totally disabling for the 10 years immediately preceding death, (2) was continuously rated as totally disabling for a period of not less than 5 years from the date of his discharge or release from active duty, or (3) was continuously rated as totally disabling for a period of not less than one year immediately preceding death, and the veteran was a former POW who died after September 30, 1999.  38 U.S.C. § 1318; 38 C.F.R. § 3.22(a).  The total rating may be schedular or may be a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 3.22(c).

The term "entitled to receive" means that, at the time of death, the veteran had filed a claim for disability compensation during his lifetime, and the veteran had service-connected disability rated totally disabling by VA for the requisite time period, but was not receiving compensation due to six possible circumstances: (1) VA was paying the compensation to the veteran's dependents; (2) VA was withholding the compensation under authority of 38 U.S.C. § 5314 to offset an indebtedness of the veteran; (3) the veteran had not waived retired or retirement pay in order to receive compensation; (4) VA was withholding payments under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. § 1174 (h)(2); (5) VA was withholding payments because the veteran's whereabouts were unknown, but the veteran was otherwise entitled to continued payments based on a total service-connected disability rating; or (6) VA was withholding payments under 38 U.S.C. § 5308 but determines that benefits were payable under 38 U.S.C. § 5309.  38 C.F.R. § 3.22(b)(3).

In addition, the term "entitled to receive" can mean that the veteran filed a claim for disability compensation during his lifetime and one of the following two circumstances is met: (1) the veteran would have received total disability compensation at the time of death for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling for the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section but for clear and unmistakable error committed by VA in a decision on a claim filed during the veteran's lifetime concerning the issues of service connection, disability evaluation, or effective date; or (2) additional evidence submitted to VA before or after the veteran's death, consisting solely of service department records that existed at the time of a prior VA decision but were not previously considered by VA, provides a basis for reopening a claim finally decided during the veteran's lifetime and for awarding a total service-connected disability rating retroactively in accordance with §§ 3.156(c) and 3.400(q)(2) of this part for the relevant period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  38 C.F.R. § 3.22 (b)(1) and (2).

Finally, 38 U.S.C. § 1318 Dependency and Indemnity Compensation claims are not subject to a "hypothetical entitlement" analysis.  Rodriguez v. Peake, 511 F.3d 1147, 1156 (2008).  Therefore, claims for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 must be adjudicated with specific regard given to decisions made during the veteran's lifetime and without consideration of hypothetical entitlement for benefits raised for the first time after a veteran's death.

II.

Analysis - Dependency and Indemnity Compensation Benefits 

At the time of his death, the Veteran was service connected for a left knee total replacement, rated as 60 percent disabling; a right knee disorder, rated as 60 percent disabling; a lumbar spine disorder, rated as 10 percent disabling; a right hip disorder, rated as 10 percent disabling; a left hip disorder, rated as 10 percent disabling; bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy, rated as 10 percent disabling for each extremity; a left hip strain, with limitation of flexion and abduction, adduction, or rotation, rated as noncompensable; and a right hip strain, with limitation of flexion, and abduction, adduction, or rotation, rated as noncompensable.  He was rated as totally disabled from September 1, 2016.  

The Veteran was not a prisoner of war.  There is also no claim pending before the Board in which the Veteran is entitled to receive a total disability rating prior to September 2016.   

In other words, the record does not show the Veteran was "entitled to receive" a total disability rating for ten years prior to his death, or continuously since his discharge from active duty and for at least five years immediately preceding death, within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 1318; nor was the Veteran a former prisoner of war.

Accordingly, the criteria for entitlement to Dependency and Indemnity Compensation benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 are not satisfied and the appeal must be denied as a matter of law.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
