DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to payment of expenses for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) dental services performed on December 16, 2019, is dismissed.   

FINDING OF FACT

Payment of the expenses of non-VA dental services provided on December 16, 2019, was approved by VA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal is moot and must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2020 decision of the VA Veterans Health Administration that denied payment of the expenses of non-VA dental services provided by the appellant to the Veteran on December 16, 2019.  The appellant appealed in January 2021.  

However, as reflected in a VA payment record and in an explanation of payment issued to the appellant in May 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction subsequently readjudicated the appellant's claim in May 2021, approved payment of the claimed expenses for the December 16, 2019, dental services, and made payment on the claim.

Given this, there no longer remains a question for appellate consideration by the Board, and the appeal must be dismissed.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104(a), 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.
