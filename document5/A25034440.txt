ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetic retinopathy, to include as secondary to service connected diabetes mellitus type II with hypertension, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

At no time during the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of such disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetic retinopathy, to include as secondary to service connected diabetes mellitus type II with hypertension, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1970 to October 1974 and is in receipt of the Vietnam Service Medal.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2022 decision. The Veteran requested an exemption to timely filing due to hardships caused by the COVID-19 national emergency. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2022 decision.

In the July 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In this case, a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is more than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, and it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the July 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Service Connection Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R.  § 3.303(d).

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141 (1992). Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that §§ 1110 and 1131's requirement of the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). Consequently, the evidence of record must show that the veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed. Here, the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has a current disability of diabetic retinopathy.

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Board must determine, as a question of fact, both the weight and credibility of the evidence. Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in a record and every item does not have the same probative value. The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of all material evidence submitted by and on behalf of a claimant, account for the evidence that it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36 (1994); Abernathy v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 461 (1992); Simon v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 621 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991). The veteran's credibility affects the weight to be given to his testimony and lay statements, and it is the Board's responsibility to determine the appropriate weight. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no obligation to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as it relates to the Veteran's claim.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetic retinopathy, to include as secondary to service connected diabetes mellitus type II with hypertension, is denied.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for diabetic retinopathy as etiologically related to his active service. See January 2019 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ). The Veteran contends that after developing diabetes mellitus, he began experiencing eye floaters and blurriness in his eyes, which affects his daily life as he is always worrying it will get worse. See December 2021, Statement in Support of Claim (VA Form 21-4138). The Veteran contends that an October 2018 Diabetic Eye Photo Screening Evaluation includes a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. See May 2019 letter. December 2020, April 2022, and August 2023 rating decisions conceded exposure to Agent Orange and found that the Veteran's primary disability, diabetes mellitus type II with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy, is service connected. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 

The Veteran's October 1974 service discharge examination found the Veteran's eyes to be normal. The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for reports of, symptoms of, treatment for, or a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.

Post-service VA treatment records do not show a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. They do show that the Veteran was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 2000's and that he received care for both his diabetes and his vision from VA treatment providers. A June 2014 Diabetic Retinopathy Surveillance Consult showed no diabetic retinopathy. An August 2019 VA treatment note showed the Veteran sought a VA comprehensive diabetic eye exam because an outside optometrist told him in 2018 that he had diabetic retinopathy. The associated August 2019 VA examination, which included a fundus examination with dilation, found that the Veteran had no diabetic retinopathy. All VA examination conducted after the Veteran reported the findings of the outside optometrist through the date of the rating decision on appeal showed no diabetic retinopathy. See, e.g., June 2014, May 2017, July 2018, October 2018, May 2019, June 2020, May 2021, January 2022 VA treatment records.

The Veteran's private treatment records showed the Veteran also received care for his diabetes and his vision from private providers. In June 2011, the Veteran reported normal diabetic eye screening results to these providers. November 2013 private treatment records showed that the Veteran was diagnosed with disorder of refraction associated with diabetes mellitus II. The associated examination included a fundus examination which showed the Veteran's vessels had a normal A:V ratio bilaterally, and the diagnosis specifically noted that the Veteran's refraction disorder was without diabetic retinopathy. July 2106 records showed a normal fundus. In October 2016, the Veteran's eyes were dilated, the fundus examined, and the blood vessels shown to have a normal A:V ratio. March, April, August 2016 and October 2017 private treatment records described the Veteran's primary service-connected disability as diabetes mellitus II without diabetic retinopathy. 

A letter from private provider D.S., O.D., showed the Veteran was provided Diabetic Retinopathy Photoscreening results in October 2018. The provider wrote that there was "evidence of early diabetic retinopathy in one or both eyes" but did not provide a diagnosis for either eye, did not provide test results, and did not provide an etiology opinion. The provider advised the Veteran to have an eye exam or repeat photoscreening within one year. As discussed above, the Veteran requested a VA comprehensive diabetic eye exam examination in August 2019 which found that the Veteran did not have diabetic retinopathy.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2019, an addendum examination and opinion in June 2019, and a VA examination and opinion in March 2022. The April 2019 examiner found that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The examiner reviewed the Veteran's record for test results indicating diabetic retinopathy or a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, found none, and conducted an eye examination which included an internal fundus examination that showed normal vessels. In June 2019, the examiner was asked to provide an addendum examination and opinion to reconcile the language in the Veteran's October 2018 private letter with the April 2019 finding that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of retinopathy. The June 2019 examiner noted there was no indication of the type of retinal findings the October 2018 provider used to reach her conclusion and that there was insufficient evidence to confirm what the private examiner saw. The examiner reaffirmed that the April 2019 VA retinal examination did not find evidence of retinopathy and opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected diabetes because no diabetic retinopathy was found.

The March 2022 examiner found that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The examiner noted that the Veteran's internal fundus examination showed normal vessels and concluded that there was no objective evidence of the claimed diabetic retinopathy. The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected diabetes because the Veteran did not have diabetic retinopathy.

In the absence of proof of a present disability there can be no valid claim for service connection. See Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, supra. As the evidence of record shows that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and no further discussion of the remaining elements is necessary. See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993) (finding that a determination of service connection requires the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and either an injury or a disease incurred in service); see also Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (finding that the absence of any one element will result in denial of service connection). In addition, the record does not reflect, and the Veteran did not allege, that he suffers from impairment of earning capacity due to his claimed diabetic retinopathy disorder that is of similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. See Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).

The Board is cognizant of the holding in Saunders v. Wilkie which stated that where pain causes functional impairment, a disability for VA compensation purposes exists, even if there is no underlying diagnosis. Saunders v. Wilkie, supra. In sum, pain alone resulting in functional impairment is in fact a disability and should not be summarily discounted as a bar to benefits based on a finding of no current diagnosis. However, the Veteran does not claim, nor do his medical records show, that he experiences pain due to his claimed diabetic retinopathy. As such, the Veteran's claimed diabetic retinopathy does not amount to a functional impairment of earning capacity, and Saunders is not applicable in this case. Moreover, the Veteran has not alleged manifestations of similar severity, frequency and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions and sincere belief that he has diabetic retinopathy that is related to service. The Veteran is competent to report his own symptoms or matters within his personal knowledge, to include the types of symptoms that are observable through the five senses. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (2006); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). In addition, the law provides that laypersons may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). However, a determination as to the appropriate diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is a complex medical determination which goes beyond lay observation of symptoms. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra; see also Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (explaining that while the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions). As there is no evidence of record that the Veteran has the requisite medical training in diagnosing disorders of the retina, the question of whether the Veteran has diabetic retinopathy may not be competently addressed by lay evidence and the assertions of the Veteran as to either the diagnosis of or the etiology of the claimed diabetic retinopathy are nonprobative.

The Board emphasizes that Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in disability. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 1110, 1131. Where the probative evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy for the entire appeal period, there can be no valid claim for service connection. See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer v. Derwinski, supra.

Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for diabetic retinopathy, to include as secondary to service connected diabetes mellitus type II with hypertension, is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.
