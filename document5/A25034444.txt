DOCKET NO. 191218-54877
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While the Veteran's appeal to the Board was pending, and prior to the issuance of a final decision, the Veteran passed away.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal currently. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1989 to September 1989, and from January 1991 to April 1991, during Peacetime and the Gulf War Era.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2019 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which in denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

In the December 2019 Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. The Veteran was scheduled for a Board hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge on April 14, 2025; however, before the Board hearing took place, news of the Veteran's death was received by VA and the hearing was cancelled.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994). This appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the appellant and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision. This process is called substitution. The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b). A request for substitution must be filed using a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant," which can be found online here: https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21P-0847-ARE.pdf.

The completed form may be submitted electronically via ACCESSVA. The web address for ACCESSVA is: https://eauth.va.gov/accessva/cspSelectFor=dmhs.

Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution. A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title...." 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a). There is a helpful factsheet that explains who is eligible for accrued benefits here: https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/general/Accrued.pdf.
