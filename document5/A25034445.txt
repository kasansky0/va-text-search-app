Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for residual fracture of right little finger, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a respiratory disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The Veteran's acne vulgaris has manifested as superficial acne.

3. The Veteran's epistaxis did not manifest with 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction of one side.

4. The Veteran experienced migraines with less frequent attacks.  The migraines did not manifest in characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.

5. The Veteran's status post right-hand little finger fracture disability has been manifested by pain, swelling, and reduced strength and dexterity; there is no evidence of ankylosis or amputation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a respiratory disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for acne vulgaris have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7828.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for epistaxis are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.97, DC 6599-6502.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for migraines have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

5. The criteria for a compensable rating for right hand little finger have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.71a, DC 5230.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served from July 2019 to July 2023. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic cough

The Veteran seeks service connection for a chronic cough.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023. The Veteran reported symptoms of coughing, shortness of breath, and wheezing. The examiner indicated chronic cough of unknown etiology. A March 2023 chest x-ray was within normal limits. Pre-bronchodilator testing revealed normal results. No functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work was indicated. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of a respiratory disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The March 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran had a cough of unknown etiology, the clinical findings and imaging were normal. Further, no functional impact on the Veteran was noted by the examiner. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of a disorder manifested by a chronic cough, and is competent to observe lay symptoms, he does not have the training or credentials to provide a competent opinion as to a diagnosis, as opposed to observations of coughing symptoms. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4. 

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence failing to show a diagnosis, and the appeal must be denied.

Increased Rating

2. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for acne 

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for acne.

The Veteran's acne is rated as noncompensable under DC 7828 pertaining to acne. This DC allows for rating acne under the specific criteria listed or by analogy to disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DCs 7801-7805), depending on the predominant disability. In this case, the Veteran's disability is more appropriately rated as acne and the criteria contained in DC 7828. 

Under DC 7828, a noncompensable rating is warranted for superficial acne (comedones, papules, pustules, superficial cysts, of any extent). A 10 percent rating is warranted for deep acne (deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts) affecting less than 40 percent of the face and neck, or deep acne other than on the face and neck. The maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for deep acne (deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts) affecting 40 percent or more of the face and neck. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7828.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023. The Veteran reported acne vulgaris of the face, chest, and back. The Veteran reported occasional acne, painful red bumps, and blisters on the lips during heat exposure. The examiner noted treatment with other-the-counter medication for 6 weeks or more, but no constant, in the previous 12 months. Physical examination revealed acne on less than 5 percent of total body area and less than 5 percent of exposed area. The examiner commented that blisters on the lips and dry skin were noted on approximately 2 percent of total body area and approximately 2 percent of exposed area. No scarring or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck was indicated. No other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and symptoms were noted.

The Board finds that a compensable rating is not warranted for the Veteran's acne as the disability most nearly approximates superficial acne that is currently inactive.

The VA examiner established the presence of acne with minimal scarring, characterized as acne vulgaris, but there is no evidence of deep acne, defined by DC 7828 as deep inflamed nodules and pus-filled cysts. Superficial acne characterized by comedones, papules, pustules, and superficial cysts is contemplated by the current noncompensable evaluation under DC 7828.

Although the condition affects the Veteran's face, there is no lay or medical evidence that it is considered disfiguring or manifests any of the characteristics of disfigurement specified by DC 7800. The Veteran's acne also does not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects.  Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, to include acne, painful bumps, and blisters on the lips, and these reports are credible.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Veteran does not assert, and medical treatment records do not show, that the acne more nearly approximates the criteria in the next higher rating.

The Board has considered whether any other Diagnostic Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  However, the evidence does not reflect that the acne would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for acne vulgaris.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). The Board, therefore, finds that the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for acne vulgaris.

3. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for epistaxis

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for epistaxis, or nosebleed.

The AOJ rated the appellant's service-connected epistaxis as noncompensable throughout the rating period on appeal under DC 6599-6502. Under Diagnostic Code 6502, pertaining to deviation of the nasal septum, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted if there is at least a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, or if there is complete obstruction of the nasal passage on one side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6502.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023. The Veteran reported persistent nosebleed symptoms, especially in the heat. No symptoms of sinus congestion, history of trauma, or specific treatment was indicated. No other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms, or scars were noted by the examiner. The Veteran's epistaxis did not have a functional impact on their ability to work.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable disability rating for the appellant's service-connected epistaxis.

In this case, the competent and persuasive evidence of record does not show the Veteran's nasal disability picture met or approximated the criteria for a compensable rating under DC 6502. The Veteran's VA examination did not show the appellant had any nasal blockage. While the appellant believes that epistaxis warrants a higher rating and is equivalent to a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both side or the complete obstruction on one side, the Veteran is not competent to provide such an opinion. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In conclusion, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable disability rating for a service-connected epistaxis. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable disability rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for tension headaches

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating for tension headaches.

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, for migraine.  Under DC 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  

The rating criteria of DC 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating.  Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018).  This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under DC 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation.  Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023. The Veteran reported daily, aching headaches. The examiner noted symptoms of pain on both sides of the head, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. The examiner found the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine or non-migraine headaches. The Veteran also did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. No other pertinent physical findings, complications, signs, symptoms, or scars were indicated.

The Board concludes that the Veteran's migraines have occurred with less frequent attacks during the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a noncompensable rating under DC 8100.  

In the March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported head pain on both sides of the head, sensitivity to light and sound. However, the examiner noted the Veteran's headaches are not prostrating and do not affect their ability to work.  

The Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  While the Veteran is competent to report readily observable symptoms, there was no additional evidence presented by the Veteran regarding their headache condition.

Considering all relevant evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence of record, the Board finds there is insufficient evidence to show the Veteran's migraines do not result in prostrating attaches. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran's migraine headaches occurred with less frequent attacks throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a noncompensable rating under DC 8100.

A compensable rating under DC 8100 is not warranted unless there are migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. Based on the VA examination, the Veteran's migraines do not result in prostrating attacks.  Thus, the Board concludes that the Veteran's migraines did not occur with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months at any time during the appeal period.  A compensable rating under DC 8100 is not warranted.

5. Entitlement to a compensable disability rating residual fracture of right little finger

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for residuals of right little finger fracture. The Veteran's right little finger fracture disability is currently assigned a noncompensable rating under DC 5230.

Under DC 5230, a noncompensable rating is warranted for any limitation of motion of the little finger. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5230. Under DC 5230, the only available disability rating is zero percent, which is assigned for any limitation of motion for both the minor and the major hands. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024. The Veteran reported lingering pain, swelling, and swelling. Physical examination revealed pain on range of motion testing. No ankylosis was indicated on examination. 

The Board finds that the evidence demonstrates that noncompensable ratings are warranted under DC 5230. The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran experienced any ankylosis of their right and left ring fingers or right and left little fingers; therefore, a 10 percent rating under DC 5223 for ankylosis of two digits or a noncompensable rating under DC 5227 for ankylosis of a single digit are not warranted.

Viewing the lay and medical evidence as a whole, the Veteran's right little finger disability is manifested by pain, stiffness, swelling, and decreased strength and dexterity of the right hand. Any limitation of motion of the right little finger alone warrants only a noncompensable rating under DC 5230. The Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum possible rating under DC 5230 based on any limitation of motion of the little finger. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5230.

As the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for limitation of little finger motion under DC 5230, the regulations pertaining to functional impairment (38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59) are not for application in this case. See Johnston, 10 Vet. App. 80; see also Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472 (2016) (finding that § 4.59 is limited by the DC applicable to a claimant's disability, and where that DC does not provide a compensable rating, § 4.59 does not apply). The Veteran cannot be compensated for painful motion under DC 5230. For a painful joint, a veteran can be awarded at least the minimum compensable rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011) (applying § 4.59 in non-arthritis contexts). However, a higher rating for pain is not available under DC 5230 because there is no minimal compensable rating. Sowers, 27 Vet. App. at 480. Thus, the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable rating under DC 5230.

DC 5227 evaluates ankylosis of the little finger and provides a noncompensable evaluation for favorable or unfavorable ankylosis. There has been no evidence of ankylosis involving the right little finger or any other finger of the right hand related to the service-connected right little finger disability during the claim period. Accordingly, this DC is not applicable.

The Board finds that the symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected residuals of a right little finger disability most closely approximate the criteria for a noncompensable rating under the rating criteria. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for status post right-hand little finger fracture with residuals disability is denied.
