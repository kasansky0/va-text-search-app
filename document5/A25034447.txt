CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for left knee arthritis with limitation of extension has been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from September 1983 to July 1987 and from October 2001 to May 2002.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). Here, a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Veteran's claim for left knee arthritis with limitation of extension with a noncompensable rating. The September 2023 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the AMA applies. The Veteran appealed that decision by submitting a September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)). The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As a result, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that potion of the claim subject to remand. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee arthritis with limitation of extension.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for left knee arthritis with limitation of extension. because of painful.  

The Veteran's disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261, for limitation of extension of the leg.  Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a noncompensable rating is warranted for extension limited to 5 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 10 degrees.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 15 degrees.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 20 degrees.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 30 degrees.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011). Painful range of motion can warrant the minimal compensable rating when, as here, the underlying diagnostic code allows for a compensable rating. See Sowers v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 472 (2016) (holding that the 4.59 rule only applies when the underlying diagnostic code provides for a compensable rating).

In this case, the VA examiner observed and recorded pain on range of motion during extension with evidence of pain with active and passive motion. Although the examination is inadequate for other aspects of this decision, as outlined below, the Board finds the Veteran has credible and documented pain on range of motion.s 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim for a 10 percent rating and, to that extent, the appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee arthritis with limitation of extension is remanded.

The Veteran contends that a higher evaluation is warranted for his left knee arthritis with limitation of extension See VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, September 2024. Specifically, the Veteran reports severe pain in his left knee on a daily basis.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, to be adequate, a VA examination of the joints must, wherever possible, include the results of the range of motion testing described in the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (2016) states that "[t]he joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint." As such, pursuant to Correia, an adequate VA joints examination must, wherever possible, include range of motion testing on active and passive motion and in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing conditions. An additional relevant opinion pertaining to flare-ups was also issued by the Court in Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2023. The Veteran reported that he feels constant pain in his left knee which required gel injections. The injections were helpful but did not last long. His work was harder to manage as it felt like he was dying from the pain. He reported that he had to wear a brace to survive the pain. The examiner noted intense deep pain on the left knee joint lasting 4-8 hours on a daily basis. However, the examiner noted no flare ups and did not provide an estimated range of motion in degrees during flare ups. Moreover, the examiner did not provide range of motion measurements with weight-bearing and non-weight bearing. The Veteran's June 2023 VA examination does not satisfy the requirements of Correia and Sharp and is, therefore, inadequate for adjudication. The AOJ's consideration of the inadequate examination amounts to pre-decisional duty to assist error. Accordingly, the Board finds that remand is required to obtain a new VA examination to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by a physician who has not previously examined the Veteran or provided an opinion in this appeal of the current severity of his left knee disability. 

The examiner must test the Veteran's active motion, passive motion, and pain with weight-bearing and without weight-bearing and if possible, with range of the opposite undamaged joint. The examiner must also attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups. To the extent possible, the examiner should identify any symptoms and functional impairments due to his disabilities and discuss the effect of the Veteran's disabilities on any occupational functioning and activities of daily living. If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement, or an opinion regarding flare-ups, symptoms, or functional impairment without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
