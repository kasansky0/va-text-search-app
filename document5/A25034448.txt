ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the approximate balance of the competent and credible evidence shows he was exposed to herbicide agent while performing his duties at Da Nang Airport.

2. The Veteran has current disabilities of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, which are presumed to be related to herbicide agent exposure.

3. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that service connection can be granted for hypertension on a theory other than the presumption provided by the PACT Act. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension due to herbicide agent exposure have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1116B, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1116B, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1968 to January 1970, March 1977 to March 1979, and November 1980 to November 1994. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the November 2020 and April 2021 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 13, 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 13, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal for the claim of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 and the April 2021 rating decision for the claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his attorney at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c) (2019). 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2) (2012).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension.

The Veteran claimed these conditions are due to his conceded exposure to Camp Lejeune Contaminated Water (CLCW).

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for certain diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents, even though there is no record of such disease during service, if they manifest to a compensable degree any time after service, in a veteran who had active military, naval, air, or space service, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, in the Republic of Vietnam, including the waters offshore, and other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in Vietnam. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e), 3.313. This presumption may be rebutted by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. § 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. The diseases that are deemed associated with herbicide agent exposure under VA law are listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Diabetes mellitus type 2 has been one of the presumed diseases for many years.

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022) was enacted on August 10, 2022. See PACT Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). Section 404 of the PACT Act added hypertension to the list of diseases which are presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents.

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1116 B (3), a Veteran who, during active military naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In the November 2020 and April 2021 rating decisions, the AOJ, among other things, determined that the Veteran has a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The Board notes that hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type II qualify as diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicides for entitlement to presumptive service connection. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6)(iv), 3.309 (e).

The remaining question in this case is whether the Veteran served in Vietnam where he was exposed to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange.

Regarding in-service exposure, the Veteran's service personnel records (SPRs) do not reflect that he was stationed in Vietnam. However, in December 2024, the Veteran competently and credibly testified under oath that while his ordered station was Okinawa, part of his duties included "flying in and out on supply runs" from Okinawa to Vietnam.  He testified that he landed at Da Nang Airport for each run.

In May 2009, prior to his claim for service connection for hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2, the Veteran reported a stressor of having nightmares regarding coffins lined on the runways at Da Nang Air Base while performing his duty in Okinawa, Japan.  The Board notes that his service-connected PTSD was granted based in part on this stressor of seeing coffins lined up on the runway at Da Nang Air Base while performing his duty at a supply area near the runway.

A September 2009 mental health treatment record notes the Veteran's report that "he spent his overseas time doing supply runs from Okinawa to Vietnam.

In November 2009, he reported service "in Vietnam from 1968-69, noting that he served with the third FSR (Force Service Regiment) taking care of supply and manpower needs and shuttled back and forth from Okinawa to Vietnam"

A May 2011 VA PTSD evaluation notes the Veteran's report that he "enlisted voluntarily and served in the United States Marine Corps first from 1968 to 1970 when he was posted in Okinawa, Japan, but made frequent trips back and forth to Vietnam". 

In March 2012, the Veteran reported during his mental health treatment that his supervisor reminded him of a first sergeant in Vietnam. 

An April 2014 VA treatment record notes the Veteran's report that he served in Vietnam, Japan and Korea.

A July 2014, neuropsychological evaluation notes that the Veteran "denied a loss of rank and reported combat in Vietnam and Yugoslavia."

 An April 2016 VA treatment record notes that the Veteran is a "Vietnam Veteran" with PTSD sustained as a result of multiple war-related traumas.

In April 2017, he reported to his treating physician that he was in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969.

In March 2020, the Veteran reported "more frequent intrusive thoughts and memories of Vietnam" during his mental health treatment.

The Veteran's DD214 Form reflects, among other awards, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal and Vietnam Service Medal.

His service personnel records indicate that he was responsible for maintaining equipment and supplies, to include being the "storage room supervisor."

On review, the Board finds that the Veteran has been very consistent in reporting his supply trips to Da Nang Airport from Okinawa, going back at least 15 years, even when he was not pursuing a claim for any herbicide agent-based benefits. Based on a review of the record, the Board finds him to be very credible in his consistent reports and testimony. He is competent to report flying to and being at Da Nang Airport.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is at least in approximate balance to find that the Veteran was temporarily in Vietnam, sometime during the period beginning in January 1968 to January 1970, where he was presumed exposed to herbicide agent. This finding is limited to the specific facts, evidence, and circumstances of this case.

Accordingly, the Board grants entitlement to service connection for hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type 2.

Theory other than PACT Act for hypertension 

For the claim of hypertension, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted on a basis other than the PACT Act.

For the theory of hypertension beginning in service, the Veteran testified at his Board hearing that it was diagnosed after he retired from service, and not within the first year of separation. While there is a favorable finding of elevated blood pressure readings in service, a VA examiner opened in April 2021 that the blood pressure readings in service did not indicate that there was any concern for hypertension during active duty, nor was hypertension diagnosed during service. Therefore, he opined that it is less likely than not that the hypertension began in service. As this is consistent with the Veteran's testimony, the Board finds that hypertension did not onset during service, or within one year of separation from service. Therefore, service connection cannot be granted under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 or §§ 3.307(a), 3.309(a) based on presumption, continuity of symptomatology, or direct service connection to elevated blood pressure readings in service.

While the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to contaminated water during his service at Camp Lejeune, hypertension is not a disease presumed to be caused by CLCW. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f). The Veteran may still establish a nexus to CLCW by other evidence, but has not presented any probative lay or medical evidence supporting a finding that his hypertension is due to CLCW. At his hearing, the Veteran testified that he believed one of his doctors probably had told him that hypertension could be caused by CLCW. 

While the Veteran is competent to report what his doctor told him, this statement does not provide the degree of certainty required for medical nexus evidence. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006) (A medical opinion that is equivocal in nature or expressed in speculative language does not provide the degree of certainty required for medical nexus evidence). Additionally, there is no medical reasoning provided to support it as a nexus opinion. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion ... must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions."). Therefore, this testimony is not sufficient to establish a nexus between hypertension and CLCW.

In conclusion, there is no competent, credible, and probative evidence establishing that the Veteran's hypertension began in service, within one year of separation, or is related to CLCW. As the evidence persuasively weighs against these theories, the Board finds that service connection for hypertension cannot be granted on a basis other than the PACT Act.
