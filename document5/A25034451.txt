REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND 

The Veteran had active service from April 1966 to April 1968.  He served in the Republic of Vietnam and was awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge.

In October 2023, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) granted a 50 percent rating, and no higher, for PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood for the period prior to November 2, 2020.  The Veteran subsequently appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

In September 2024, the Court granted the Parties' Joint Motion for Partial Remand; vacated that portion of the October 2023 Board decision that denied a rating in excess of 50 percent, on and prior to November 2, 2020, for PTSD with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood; and remanded the issue to the Board for further action consistent with the Joint Motion for Partial Remand.

On November 2, 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction granted service connection for PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and assigned a 30 percent rating for that disability, effective May 28, 2013.  In January 2021, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. ยง 20.303.  However, as the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the adjudication of that claim.   38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is remanded. 

In its September 2024 decision, the Court determined that the Board had not properly addressed a July 2013 evaluation from W. Anderson, Psy.D., which discussed the Veteran's cognitive difficulties, diminished ability to think, and indecisiveness. 

In his January 2025 Appellate Brief Presentation, the Veteran's representative asserted that the October 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) psychiatric examination report is inadequate for rating purposes as the examiner failed to properly address Dr. Anderson's findings of cognitive difficulties, diminished ability to think, indecisiveness, cognitive and physiological responses to environmental cues in rection to rainstorms, and hypervigilance. 

VA's duty to assist includes, in appropriate cases, the duty to conduct a thorough and contemporaneous medical examination which is accurate and fully descriptive. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 121 (1991).  When VA obtains an examination or opinion, the examination or opinion must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  

The October 2020 VA psychiatric examination report indicates that the Veteran's records, including his VA e-folder, had been reviewed.  The examiner did not specifically address Dr. Anderson's findings.  Considering such deficiency, the Board finds that the examination report is of limited probative value.  Further VA psychiatric evaluation is needed.  That is a pre decisional error.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA psychiatric examination to ascertain the nature and severity of the service-connected PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The examiner must review the record, including the July 2013 evaluation from W. Anderson, Psy.D., and should specifically address the doctor's findings of cognitive difficulties, diminished ability to think, indecisiveness, cognitive and physiological responses to environmental cues in rection to rainstorms, restricted range of affect, fatigue, loss of energy, depression, anxiety, and hypervigilance.  A rationale for all opinions should be provided.  The examiner should opine as to the levels of occupational and social impairment caused by the service-connected PTSD and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood during all relevant periods.
