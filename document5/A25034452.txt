REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Kaerbears Healthcare LLC, is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical services to the Veteran on August 7, 2020.?

In September 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct review docket to review a May 2021 decision issued by a VA Medical Center for the August 7, 2020, episode of care.

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical care provided to the Veteran on August 7, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  A February 2022 Explanation of Payment indicates that the claim was approved and $111.88 was paid to the provider, which constituted a payment in full.  In a December 2022 letter, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Finance informed the appellant secondary review indicated that the appeal had been approved, and the appealed claim would be reprocessed according to VA policy.   

The Board acknowledges that the payment may be less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the August 7, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.  

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the August 7, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial, and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
