REMANDED

Entitlement to restoration of education benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2002 to December 2011 and from August 2012 to June 2017. The appellant is the Veteran's spouse.

The decision on appeal was issued in July 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to restoration of education benefits is remanded.

The appellant seeks restoration of his VA educational benefits due to the closure of his educational institution. 

Relevant to the instant case, the Colmery Act, also known as the Forever GI Bill, enacted August 16, 2017, amended Title 38, Chapter 36, to provide for restoration of certain Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance benefits for individuals affected by closures of educational institutions.  See The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-48, § 109, 131 Stat. 977 (2017); see also 38 U.S.C. § 3699 (providing that payment of educational assistance shall not be charged against any entitlement to educational assistance of the individual concerned if the Secretary determined that the individual was unable to complete such course or program as a result of the closure of the educational institution). The amendment made to Title 38, Chapter 36, was to "take effect on the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of [the Colmery Act], and shall apply with respect to courses and programs of education discontinued as described in section 3699 of title 38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a)(1), after January 1, 2015."  See Pub. L. 115-48, § 109 at 8; see also 38 U.S.C. § 3699, Notes.

The law defines several types of restoration of entitlement cases.  Specifically, the Special Application provision applies to individuals who were affected by schools that closed or were disapproved during the period from January 1, 2015, through August 16, 2017.  This provision provides that if an individual who attended an accredited Institution of Higher Learning that closed during the period from January 1, 2015, through August 16, 2017, and was last enrolled within 120 days of the school's closure, did not transfer any credits to another college, that individual will not be charged entitlement for the entire period of enrollment at the closed facility and VA will retroactively restore any entitlement previously charged to affected beneficiaries.  38 U.S.C. § 3699, Notes.  Those not covered by the Special Application provision and who were affected by school closures or disapprovals during the period from August 17, 2017, through July 31, 2021, qualify for Regular Restoration of Entitlement and will not be charged for the individual term, quarter, or semester they were enrolled in at the time of the school closure or disapproval.  Effective August 1, 2021, however, VA will restore entitlement for the entire program of education, not just the last term, quarter, or semester if a covered was not able to transfer at least 12 credits to a new school.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3699(c)(2)(A); see also The Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, Pub. L. 116-315, § 1021(b), 134 Stat. 4937 (2021) (providing that 38 U.S.C. §3699(c)(2)(A) shall take effect on August 1, 2021).

Here, the appellant used VA educational benefits to pursue a course of study at L'Academie De Cuisine ("School"). Evidence in the record shows that the appellant attended the School from October 2016 until December 15, 2017, when the School closed. At the time the School closed, the appellant was in good standing and had completed coursework, but still needed to complete the required externship in order to complete his program of study. See Transcript and January 31,2018 letter from F.D.

Evidence in the record shows that the appellant inquired with two institutions, Stratford University and Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). 

In February 2018, the appellant sought to restore eligibility for the time period spent at the School. In a February 2018 application for restoration and subsequent electronic message, the appellant stated that he was completing his program of study at Stratford University via a "Teach out" agreement with the School. In the application, he stated that he received credit at the new institution for some coursework completed at the School, but in a subsequent electronic message, he stated that he was waiting for Stratford to confirm that he was able to transfer credit.  Also in February 2018, the appellant filed a Request for Change of Program to Stratford University.

In a March 2018 decision, the AOJ determined that the Veteran was not eligible for restoration because his new school granted him credit for courses completed at the School.

In July 2020, the appellant's spouse sent an electronic message to VA stating that Stratford University did not have a "teach out" program, and the appellant filed a request for restoration stating that he was attending AACC, but that AACC would not accept any transfer credit for courses he took at the School. In a June 2019 electronic message, AACC stated that it would not be able to offer the appellant more than 50 percent of the courses in their program of study. In a November 2019 letter, AACC sent the appellant a letter stating that it evaluated the appellant's coursework at the School and recommended further coursework to be completed.

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record pursuant to applicable statute and regulation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a). In this case, the Board does not have before it the evidence necessary to determine whether the AOJ correctly adjudicated the merits of the instant appeal and cannot fulfill its statutory and regulatory requirement to base its decision on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802, the Board may remand for correction of any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. The Board finds that the AOJ erred in not ensuring that all the necessary evidence was of record for review by the Board and failing to provide the legally required notice. Accordingly, a remand is necessary in this case. 

In addition, the Board is unable to determine based on the record evidence if the notices of decision complied with the content requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including but not limited to a summary of the applicable laws and regulations, identification of findings favorable to the claimant. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Contact the appellant regarding whether he enrolled in any other culinary arts program, to include Anne Arundel Community College.

2. Fully explain to the appellant that based on his school closure date, he would only be eligible to restoration if he enrolled in a new school.

(Continued on the next page)

?

3. If the Veteran did enroll in a new culinary arts program, take steps to verify the appellant's enrollment, and identify which credits, if any, were accepted for transfer to the new school. 

4. After the development is completed, readjudicate the appellant's claim and furnish the appellant a decision that complies with 38 U.S.C. § 5104, including but not limited to a summary of the applicable laws and regulations, identification of findings favorable to the claimant. Ensure that all evidence upon which the decision is based is identified in the notice and made part of the electronic record for review by the Board.
