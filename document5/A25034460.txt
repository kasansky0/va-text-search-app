ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 10, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for adjustment disorder mixed anxiety with depressed mood, chronic and insomnia (herein after referred to as a "psychiatric disorder"), with tinnitus, is granted.

Entitlement to an initial 70 percent rating, but no higher, for a psychiatric disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The first correspondence that can be interpreted to be a claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder was received on May 24, 2015. Service connection for a psychiatric disorder was denied in a September 2015 rating decision. The Veteran submitted further information, ultimately culminating in a September 2017 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year, to include any VA treatment records under constructive receipt. Therefore, the September 2017 decision is final.

2. After the September 2017 rating decision, the next correspondence that can be interpreted to be a claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder was received on September 10, 2020. The appeal remained pending until service connection for a psychiatric disorder was granted in an October 2023 rating decision, with a February 23, 2023 effective date.

3. The Veteran's psychiatric disorder most nearly approximates occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, but less than total occupational and social impairment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 10, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400, 3.2500.

2. The criteria for an initial 70 percent rating for a psychiatric disorder, but no higher, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a), 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9440.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1986 to December 1988 and April 1989 to April 1993. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran timely appealed, submitting a VA Form 10182 the next month and selecting the Direct Review docket. In the Direct Review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision on appeal for each issue, although the Board notes, that in this particular case, the rating decision on appeal noted that the evidentiary record closed as of the date of its prior decision, or October 2023, and the Board abides by that same date. Accordingly, no additional evidence after the October 2023 rating decision may be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Of note, the Veteran, who is pro se, when he filed his May 2024 VA Form 10182, cited rating decisions that were untimely (September 2016, March 2017, and September 2017) and are not before the Board. He also submitted another VA Form 10182 the same day citing the most recent rating decision as the decision on appeal. This claim is properly before the Board and the Board favorably interprets his claim as disagreeing with both the disability rating and its effective date for his service-connected psychiatric disorder. However, the untimely rating decisions cited in his other VA Form 10182 will be addressed in the instant decision.

Effective Dates

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An initial claim includes a new claim requesting service connection and a claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, but only if the claim for an increase is received within one year from such date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). 

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim is a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014). The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are: (1) intent to apply for benefits; (2) identification of the benefits sought; and (3) communication in writing. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

From March 24, 2015, a claim must be filed on a designated VA form. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2018); 79 Fed. Reg. 57,696 (Sept. 25, 2014).

After March 24, 2015, aside from submitting a formal claim, a Veteran may file an intent to file a claim via a saved electronic application, written intent on a prescribed intent to file a claim form, or oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel and recorded in writing. If VA receives a complete application appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. If any communication indicating a desire for benefits is not completed by one of these three options, then such communication is considered a request for an application form for benefits and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2018).

Prior to February 19, 2019, a final claim is one in which the period to file a notice of disagreement has expired or there is a disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d). A claimant must file a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that notice of the determination is mailed to him or her. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52. A decision will not become final if new and material evidence is submitted within one year of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

A rating decision is final and binding as to the conclusions based on the evidence on file at the time VA issues written notification. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(a). A final and binding AOJ decision will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). Where the evidence establishes such an error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended, and it will have the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the same date as the reversed or amended decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).

1. Entitlement to an effective date of September 10, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for psychiatric disorder is granted.

The Veteran's VA Form 10182 indicates that he is claiming an earlier effective date from when he first filed his claim.

To establish an effective date earlier than February 23, 2023 for the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, the Veteran would need to show (1) that he had a prior claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder that remained pending, and, if so, (2) that such disability first manifested prior to February 23, 2023. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Date of Claim

On May 2015, the Veteran filed a claim for a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which was denied in a September 2015 rating decision. He filed a subsequent claim in December 2016 along with further information regarding his PTSD. Another rating decision was issued in March 2017 denying the PTSD and depression. The Veteran filed another claim and submitted further information regarding his PTSD in July 2017. PTSD and depression were subsequently denied in a September 2017 rating decision. The Veteran did not appeal the decision, nor was new and material evidence received within one year. As a result, the September 2017 rating decision is final.

After the September 2017 rating decision, the next correspondence that can be interpreted to be a claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder was received on September 10, 2020, when the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ. He received a response several days from the AOJ that he had submitted the wrong form and advised him of a list of options to choose from in order to file the correct form. In November 2020 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, and a letter was sent to him the next month advising him that no further action would be taken until they receive a completed application; however, the letter did not state which claim, nor which document it was referring to.  In March 2021 another letter was sent to the Veteran advising him that his Request for Higher-Level in response to the September 2017 rating decision was rejected due to it being untimely. In June 2022 the Veteran submitted another VA Form 21-526EZ, which was construed by the AOJ to be Supplemental Claim. A rating decision was issued in October 2022 denying the psychiatric disorder claim. The Veteran then filed a Request for Higher Level Review in December 2022, and a February 2023 rating decision stated that there was "a difference of opinion" being asserted during the higher-level review for this disorder. In October 2023 the Veteran was granted service connection for his psychiatric condition, effective February 23, 2023.

After reviewing the file sympathetically, the Board finds that the date of claim is September 10, 2020. Specifically, the Board finds that the September 2020 VA Form 526EZ was an attempt to submit a Supplemental Claim. Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028. The AOJ rejected this claim on September 2020, and the Veteran then attempted to comply by filing VA Form 20-0996 in November 2020.   The Board liberally construes this as an attempt to seek Higher-Level Review of the AOJ's refusal to accept his supplemental claim.  His claim was next adjudicated in an October 2022 rating decision, and the Veteran continuously pursued his claim until he was granted service connection via the October 2023 rating decision. Accordingly, as the Veteran has continuously pursued his supplemental claim, the Board finds that the date of claim is September 10, 2020 due to the Veteran continuously pursuing his claim from that date.

Date of Entitlement

Because the Veteran had a pending claim from September 10, 2020, the Board must determine the date of entitlement for the grant of service connection for the psychiatric disorder. 

Although there are no VA treatment records, private treatment records, or lay statements of symptomatology in the record on or prior to September 10, 2020, a VA treatment record from January 2023 discusses the Veteran's statement that his psychiatric symptoms started in service and are still continuing to the present. As the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in the favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the date of entitlement is at least September 10, 2020.

Because the date of entitlement is no later than the date of claim, an effective date of September 10, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for the Veteran's psychiatric disorder is GRANTED.

2. Entitlement to an initial 70 percent rating, but no higher, for a psychiatric disorder is granted.

The Veteran's psychiatric disorder is currently rated 50 percent disabling. He asserts that throughout the entire appeal his psychiatric disorder has been more severe than the currently assigned rating and that he is entitled to an increased rating. As this is an initial increased rating claim, the period on appeal begins on September 10, 2020, the date service connection was established (per the instant grant in this Board decision).

The Veteran's psychiatric condition is currently rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9440. Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 50 percent rating for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when the psychiatric condition produces occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational or social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 

After a review of the medical and lay evidence, the Board finds that the criteria for a higher rating of 70 percent are met throughout the entire period on appeal. The evidence shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder produces deficiencies in most areas due to such symptoms as: chronic sleep impairment, mood swings, crying spells, panic attacks, depression, anxiety, hypervigilance, isolation, intrusive thoughts, anger issues, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, nightmares, flashbacks, feelings of loneliness and detachment from loved ones, anhedonia, self-destructive behaviors, memory loss, paranoia, and suicidal ideations. See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017) ("the presence of suicidal ideation alone, that is, a Veteran's thoughts of his or her own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.").  See January and April 2023 VA treatment note; June 2023 VA examination; May 2024 VA Form 10182 and addendum.

Conversely, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms do not more nearly approximate a rating of 100 percent as they are not of such a severity or frequency to result in total occupational and social impairment. In this regard, there is no medical or lay evidence in the record of an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Notably, the VA examiner did not find that the Veteran was totally occupationally and socially impaired. 

As to social impairment, the Veteran has been married to the same woman over 30 years and related to the VA examiner that although his marriage has its ups and downs it is still pretty good. See June 2023 VA examination. He has a good relationship with his daughter and stated he has friends, but they live in different states. Id. He has expressed that he has had relationship loss and gets angry with the ones he loves. See January 2023 VA treatment record; May 2024 VA Form 10182 Addendum. Thus, although the evidence indicates difficulty establishing and maintaining effective relationships, it reflects neither an inability to do so, nor total social impairment consistent with an evaluation in excess of 70 percent.

As to occupational impairment, the Veteran works in manufacturing as a supervisor and currently works as an assemble operator. See June 2023 VA examination. He reports he has had some job stress and gets angry at work. See January 2023 VA treatment record; May 2024 VA Form 10182 Addendum. Nonetheless, he is gainfully employed, even with his challenges.

Regarding suicidal ideation, in the January 2023 VA treatment record the Veteran reported that he last had suicidal ideations in July/August of 2022.

The Board notes that the evidence of record shows the Veteran has additional symptomatology not enumerated in the rating criteria, including hypervigilance, isolation, intrusive thoughts, and anger issues. However, the symptoms listed in the rating criteria are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. These additional symptoms are contemplated by the assigned 70 percent rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

A higher, 100 percent rating is not warranted as the evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran has exhibited the level of cognitive, occupational, and social impairment that render him totally occupationally and socially impaired as a result of the type of symptoms listed in the general rating schedule or symptoms of a similar degree. There have been no deficiencies identified in the Veteran's thought processes or communication, inability to perform activities of daily living, and he has never reported memory loss, delusions, or hallucinations, of the severity contemplated by a 100 percent rating. To that end, throughout the VA treatment records it was noted that the Veteran appeared oriented times 4 (person, place, time, situation); mood/affect were congruent with the topics discussed; and thought processes were linear and goal-directed; and there was no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or psychosis. See January, March, and April 2023 VA treatment record. As such, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology does not more closely approximate the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating under the general rating schedule for psychiatric disorders. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.
