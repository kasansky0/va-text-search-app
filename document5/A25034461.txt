REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from July 1971 to July 1973.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Generally, service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from an injury or disease caused or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). A grant for service connection for a disability requires: (1) a present disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the in-service event, injury, or disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A disability, with no causal relationship ("nexus") to an in-service event can be considered service-connected by being proximately due to or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. See 38 § C.F.R. §3.310(a)-(b). To establish secondary service connection there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) competent evidence establishing a link ("nexus") between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including the evidence pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for left knee DJD. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle DJD.

3. Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity, radical; ulnar radicular pain parasthesia.

4. Entitlement to service connection for cervicothoracic spine pain.

The Veteran seeks service connection for left knee DJD, left ankle DJD, left upper extremity, radical; ulnar radicular pain parasthesia, and cervicothoracic spine pain. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (August 2020). The Veteran reported that that he injured his left ankle and left knee during physical training exercises, and he was treated with light duty and pain medication during service. He further stated that his left upper extremity radiculopathy and cervical spine pain began during active duty. He indicated that all of these conditions are worsening over time. See C&P Exam (April 2021). 

The Veteran is diagnosed with DJD of the left knee, left ankle, and cervical spine. The Veteran is also diagnosed with cervical strain and radiculopathy of the left upper extremity. Service treatment records show the Veteran sought treatment for knee crepitus and was diagnosed with probable chondromalacia during active duty. Service treatment records also show the Veteran was treated for an ankle sprain and tendonitis as well as left hand pain and an inability to straighten his fingers. See Rating Decision - Narrative (September 2024). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran reported his symptoms began during active duty. He further reported that his symptoms have continued and worsened since active service. See C&P Exam (April 2021). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2). The Veteran is competent to describe the onset and progressive nature of his symptoms. Moreover, these findings are supported by his service treatment records as noted above, which showed complaints and treatment for symptoms related to an ankle, knee, cervical spine pain, and radiculopathy. Thus, the Veteran's competent statements regarding the onset and continuous nature of his symptoms are credible and constitute probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim. 

In addition to his competent statements, the Veteran was examined by a private medical expert in July 2020. That medical expert noted that while stationed in Paris Island, the Veteran was working with his rifle when, for an extended period, he suddenly lost use of his left arm. He was tended to by military medical personnel due to the issue, but no treatment was provided. In terms of his left knee and ankle, the medical expert reported that the Veteran developed left knee pain during his active duty as a result of an injury that occurred while playing on the military basketball team; the Veteran sprained his ankle during physical training and was tended to by military medical personnel. After examining the Veteran, the medical expert concluded that the Veteran's left knee DJD, left ankle DJD, left upper extremity, radical; ulnar radicular pain parasthesia, and cervicothoracic spine pain conditions are as likely as not directly and causally related to his military service. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (August 2020). 

There are no reasons or bases requirement imposed on medical examiners. An adequate medical report must rest on correct facts and reasoned medical judgment so as inform the Board on a medical question and facilitate the Board's consideration and weighing of the report against any contrary reports. See Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012); see also, Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding in the context of weighing one medical opinion with another that "[i]t is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion . . . that contributes probative value to a medical opinion"); D'Aries, 22 Vet.App. at 104 ("An opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and examinations and also describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's 'evaluation of the claimed disability will be a fully informed one.'" (quoting Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 407 (1994))); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (holding that a medical opinion "must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

Here, the July 2020 examination was provided by a medical professional who possesses the necessary education, training, and expertise to provide the requested examination. Additionally, the examiner's findings were based on a review of the Veteran's record and his competent lay statements. Thus, the July 2020 examination and findings are adequate and constitute highly probative evidence weighing substantially for the Veteran's claim.

On the other hand, the evidence includes VA opinions adverse to the Veteran's claim. However, the Board finds these opinions inadequate. Specifically, the VA medical opinions do not address the private opinion by the Veteran's medical expert. Moreover, those opinions do not address the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements regarding the onset and continuous nature of his symptoms. See C&P Exam (April 2020). Consequently, these opinions are afforded minimal probative weight. 

On balance, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the claims and shows the Veteran incurred left knee DJD, left ankle DJD, left upper extremity pain parasthesia, and cervicothoracic spine pain in service with symptoms and treatments continuing since. Entitlement to service connection for these disabilities, on a direct basis, is therefore warranted.
