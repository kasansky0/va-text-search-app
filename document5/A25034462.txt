ORDER

New and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU).

REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 70 percent for unspecified anxiety disorder with functional gastrointestinal symptomatology is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating higher than 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, type II, is remanded.

Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

New evidence was received after an unappealed September 2018 rating decision that is relevant to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudicating the claim for entitlement to a TDIU are met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to January 1969, including service in the Republic of Vietnam.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that denied the Veteran's claims for a disability rating higher than 20 percent for diabetes mellitus, type II, on the basis that the evidence does not demonstrate treatment with insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities; denied a disability rating higher than 70 percent for anxiety disorder with functional gastrointestinal symptomatology on the basis that the evidence does not demonstrate total occupational and social impairment, and denied entitlement to a TDIU on the basis that the Veteran did not submit new and relevant evidence to reopen the claim.

In May 2024, the Veteran's attorney initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge and the opportunity to submit additional evidence within 90 days after the hearing.  In June 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran and his attorney that the appeal had been placed on the Board's hearing docket.

June 2024 Board correspondence notified the Veteran and his attorney that a virtual hearing was scheduled in September 2024.  However, on the day of the hearing, his attorney notified the Board that the Veteran was unable to connect.  The Board rescheduled the hearing for December 17, 2024 and notified the Veteran and his attorney in September 2024.  However, on the day of the Board hearing, the Veteran's attorney submitted notification to the Board that the Veteran's request for a hearing was withdrawn.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, specifically, February 26, 2024, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his attorney within 90 days following receipt of the withdrawal of the hearing on December 17, 2024.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(b).  The record reflects that evidence was submitted by the Veteran's attorney outside the AMA evidence submission periods for this appeal.  However, because the Board is remanding the increased rating claims and the claim of entitlement for a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

New and Relevant Evidence

Under AMA, VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38?C.F.R. §?3.156(d).  "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38?C.F.R. §?3.2501(a)(1). 

Here, prior to enactment of AMA, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU in a September 2018 rating decision that was not appealed and is therefore final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160, 20.201, 20.1103 (2018).  The Board finds that subsequent to the September 2018 rating decision, new evidence was submitted that is relevant to the claim for entitlement to a TDIU.  Specifically, whereas the Veteran did not submit a VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability in support of his TDIU claim prior to the September 2018 rating decision, during the present claim period the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 in November 2023.  The information the Veteran entered into the VA Form 21-8940 constitutes new and relevant evidence as it tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue, i.e., it speaks to the current impact of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.2501(a)(1).

Therefore, the evidence is new and relevant and, the claims of entitlement to a TDIU may be readjudicated; to this extent only, the appeal is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

It is unclear from the record whether the Veteran was provided advance notice of his VA examinations.  The evidence in that regard consists only of a November 14, 2023 examination scheduling request and the December 7, 2023 and February 21, 2024 examination scheduling request contention indicating that the Veteran did not report for the examinations, with no other details.  Notably, the Veteran received advance notice of prior VA examinations for other claims for which he reported.  As advance notice of the examinations pertaining to the instant claims has not been associated with the claims file, the Board is unable to determine whether the Veteran received notification of the scheduled VA examinations.  

Failure to provide adequate notice of an upcoming examination is a duty to assist error, for which a remand is required to schedule the Veteran for VA examinations addressing the current severity of his anxiety disorder and diabetes mellitus, type II, with proper notice of such examinations.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The Board emphasizes that the Veteran maintains the ultimate burden to establish entitlement to increased ratings.  See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (2009).  The Veteran in this case is advised that the failure to report for VA examination or fully participate in the examinations could negatively affect his claims.  See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) (VA's duty to assist is a two-way-street; an appellant who wants help cannot passively wait for it).

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is intertwined with the claims being remanded. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).  Thus, adjudication of the TDIU claim is deferred.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination as to the severity of the service-connected unspecified anxiety disorder with functional gastrointestinal symptomatology.  

Please provide the Veteran and his representative advance notice of the examination date and time and associate a record of the notice with the Veteran's electronic claims file.  

The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the examiner.  All indicated studies, tests, and evaluations must be conducted, and all findings reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination as to the severity of the service-connected diabetes mellitus, type II.  Please provide the Veteran and his representative advance notice of the examination date and time and associate a record of the notice with the Veteran's electronic claims file.  The claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to, and be reviewed by, the examiner.  All indicated studies, tests, and evaluations must be conducted, and all findings reported in detail and correlated to a specific diagnosis.
