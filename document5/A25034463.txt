REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from June 2011 to November 2014.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO/AOJ) October 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of an April 2023 decision denying service connection for upper and lower back strain, previously addressed as lumbosacral strain. The Veteran appealed the October 2023 HLR by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on August 26, 2024. He requested Direct Review.

In May 2021, the Veteran filed an application claiming entitlement to service connection including for "back strain" and "mid/lower back (thoracolumbar spine)."  A June 2021 decision denied service connection for a "back strain." In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision review Request: Higher Level Review.  An October 2021 HLR decision determined that there had been a duty to assist error in not obtaining an examination and medical opinion noting during service the Veteran had complained of left shoulder and "upper back pain."  A February 2022 decision granted service connection for a left shoulder disability and denied service connection for a "lumbosacral strain." In September 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, requesting review of the February 2022 decision. A November 2022 HLR decision determined that there had been a duty to assist error in not obtaining an examination and opinion as to the cervical spine. An April 2023 decision denied service connection for "upper and lower back strain." In June 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, accepted as a request for review of the April 2023 decision, and an October 2023 HLR decision continued that denial of service connection for "upper and lower back strain (previously addressed as lumbosacral strain)," i.e., thoracolumbar spine and cervical spine disorders.  

The August 2024 VA Form 10182 also identified the issues of service connection for tinnitus and right shoulder disability. Both issues were addressed in a June 2021 rating decision.  An "appeal of a decision by the [AOJ] consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board in accordance with the provisions of [38 C.F.R.] §§20.202-20.204." 38 C.F.R. § 20.201. Those regulations provide that a "a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the [AOJ] within one year" from the notice of decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. While regulations also provide that an extension of the one-year period "may be granted" for good cause, a "request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board."  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) (time limit "may be extended" but the required action "must be" taken at the same time or before filing an extension request).  The Board's "authority to adjudicate Veterans benefits disputes - i.e., its subject matter jurisdiction" is not eliminated by a nonconforming VA Form 10182. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021).  Here, no such request is of record. See Scott v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 184, 189 (1994) (quoting Corry v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 231, 235 (1992)) ("There is no legal entitlement to an extension").  

Concerning the issues on appeal, remanded for the reasons below, the August 2024 VA Form 10182 is clearly sufficient identify and timely as to the October 2023 HLR.  The Board will liberally construe a Notice of Disagreement, but no such construction is necessary here. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  The August 2024 VA Form 10182 initiated appeal only of the October 2023 HLR as to the issue(s) of entitlement to service connection for upper and lower back strain, previously addressed as lumbosacral strain, i.e., entitlement to service connection for a thoracolumbar spine and a cervical spine disorder.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 11, 2023 AOJ decision subsequently subject to higher-level review in October 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. However, because the Board is remanding the issues on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).  

1. Entitlement to service connection for a thoracolumbar spine disorder.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder.  

The Veteran maintains that service connection is warranted for upper and lower back strains, i.e., cervical and thoracolumbar spine disorders.  He attributes his upper back (cervical) pain to ruck marches that were not ergonomically safe, and in his lower back due to carrying heavy gear while deployed. During service, in June 2014, the Veteran indicated he had recurrent back pain or other back problems which he described as "upper back pain."  The evaluating physician noted it was minor and that the Veteran had "no limitation."  

One of the effects of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) is to narrow the set of circumstances in which the Board must remand appeals to the AOJ for further development instead of deciding the appeal.  However, the Board has the duty to remand issues when necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error where the issues cannot be granted in full.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

A January 2022 VA examiner diagnosed a lumbosacral strain.  The Veteran reported he wore heavy gear while deployed and developed lower back pain which had stayed the same since-intermittent throbbing and increased pain with prolonged standing.  The examiner opined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain resulted from service. The examiner acknowledged that the rigor of duties associated with military service can potentially lead to back injury, and that the Veteran reported upper back pain in June 2014.  The examiner reasoned, however, that the Veteran had reported lower back pain during examination and had not complained of chronic back symptoms proximate to his separation in November 2014.  

At a December 2022 VA cervical spine examination, the Veteran reported symptom onset in 2011 during basic training ruck marches that had continued to worsen during service.  The examiner opined that a cervical spine disorder was less likely than not the result of service. The examiner reasoned that, during service, the Veteran was not treated for a cervical spine disorder because one did not exist, as no clinical note indicated a cervical spine disorder.  After service, the examiner stated, medical records revealed no treatment for a cervical spine disorder and examination had shown no significant clinical findings.

The December 2022 VA examiner's rationale is conclusory, lacking explanation of why the Veteran's documented report of in-service recurrent upper back pain, or the observed painful limited motion of the cervical spine at examination, are not clinically significant such that those records do not support a claim for service connection. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).  If there was a medical basis for dismissing the significance of the Veteran's complaints, such was not made apparent, and the December 2022 VA examiner may not base a negative nexus opinion solely on the lack of contemporaneous documentation in medical records. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 131, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

Moreover, the January 2022 VA examiner acknowledge that it is plausible that the rigors of military service may result in back injury and diagnosed a lumbosacral strain.  This acknowledgment falls well short of consideration of the Veteran's report that his lumbosacral strain is related to wearing heavy gear while deployed, and such is required for an opinion to be adequate.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020) (holding an examiner's failure to consider a veteran's testimony when forming a medical opinion renders that opinion inadequate).  

Accordingly, it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error for the AOJ to rely on the inadequate January 2022 and December 2022 VA opinions in adjudicating the claim for service connection for thoracolumbar spine and cervical spine disorders.  

While the Veteran also reported chiropractic treatment during examination, the AOJ's duty to assist by efforts to obtain relevant private treatment records is limited to those adequately identified.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1)(i).  

Remand is required to obtain new medical opinions addressing the etiology of the Veteran's lumbosacral sprain and claimed cervical spine disorder to correct the above duty to assist error, committed by the AOJ prior to the October 2023 HLR on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2502, 20.802(a).  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:  

Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's lumbosacral sprain and cervical spine disorder.  The Veteran's claims file must be made available to the examiner.  After reviewing the claims file, with any necessary examination and testing, the examiner should opine on the following:  

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's lumbosacral sprain was incurred in or caused by service?  The examiner must address the Veteran's contention that his lumbosacral sprain is related to carrying heavy gear while deployed and that he sought treatment after service.

(b.) Identify/diagnose any cervical spine disorder that presently exists or that has existed during the appeal period.  

?

If a diagnosis cannot be provided but a cervical spine disorder manifests in symptoms that cause functional impairment, then the examiner should consider such a "disability" for the purposes of providing the opinion requested below.  

If it is determined that the Veteran does not have cervical spine disorder or functional impairment of the cervical spine, the examiner must reconcile this conclusion with the Veteran's limited range of motion in December 2022 and reports of symptoms including numbness and pain, especially when working.  

(c.) For any diagnosed cervical spine disorder or functional impairment of the cervical spine, is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such was caused by or incurred during service?  

The examiner must address the Veteran's statement that ruck marching was ergonomically unsafe and reports of recurrent back pain and/or upper back pain during service and that he sought treatment after service, as well as his reports of pain impairing his ability to work and the VA examination showing limited range of motion of the cervical spine with pain.  

The examiners must fully explain the rationale for all opinions, with citation to supporting data/lay statements, as deemed appropriate.  If the examiners cannot provide the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, they should expressly indicate this and provide a supporting rationale as to why an opinion cannot be made without resorting to speculation.
