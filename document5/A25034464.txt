ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in August 2020. The immediate cause of death listed on the death certificate was coronary artery disease, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney failure listed as other significant conditions contributing to death.

2. At the time of the Veteran's death, service connection was not established for any disorders.

3. The Veteran served in Thailand during the Vietnam era and was exposed to herbicide agents.

4. After resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence persuasively establishes that the cause of the Veteran's death was etiologically related to his active service, to include herbicide agent exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1966 to October 1969, with service in Thailand from October 1968 to October 1969. He died in August 2020. The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2021 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the November 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Appellant elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held in January 2025 before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant, or her representative, at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection for the Cause of the Veteran's Death

The Veteran died in August 2020. The primary cause of death listed on the Veteran's death certificate is coronary artery disease, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney failure listed as other significant conditions contributing to death. In support of her claim, the Appellant asserts that the Veteran's cause and/or contributing causes of death were the result of his service in Thailand, and that they were the result of exposure to herbicide agents. See November 2020 VA Form 21-534EZ and December 2020 spouse statement.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: '(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service' the so-called "nexus requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Service connection may be presumed for certain chronic diseases if such disease manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Service connection may be granted for the cause of the veteran's death if a disorder incurred in or aggravated by service either caused or contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312 (a). For a service-connected disability to be the cause of death, it must singly or with some other condition be the immediate or underlying cause or be etiologically related. For a service-connected disability to constitute a contributory cause, it is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a causal connection. 38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. § 3.312.

Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for a disability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability is due to disease or injury which was incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

To establish service connection for a disability resulting from exposure to a herbicide agent (including Agent Orange), a veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served in the Republic of Vietnam between January 1962 and May 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to a herbicide agent absent affirmative evidence to the contrary demonstrating that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (f). If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, then certain diseases shall be service-connected even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).

For the purposes of this section, the term "herbicide agent" means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6), 3.309(e), 3.313.

The Appellant indicated she was seeking service connection under the PACT Act, for which herbicide agent exposure is presumed for Veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 20, 1976.  However, as this appeal predates the PACT Act, the Veteran may be entitled to an earlier effective date if exposure to herbicide agents can be established on a facts-found basis. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (unavailability of a presumption does not foreclose service connection on a direct basis).

1. In addition to exposure within the Republic of Vietnam, exposure to herbicide agents has also been noted to have occurred in various places, including Thailand. VA has established a procedure for ROs to follow in claims based on exposure to herbicides in Thailand during the Vietnam Era. See VA Adjudication Manual, M21-1MR, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2, Section C (M21-MR); Compensation and Pension Bulletin, May 2010. VA has determined that there was significant use of herbicide agents on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand for the purpose of eliminating vegetation and ground cover for base security purposes as evidenced in a declassified Vietnam Era Department of Defense document titled, "Project CHECO Southeast Asia Report: Base Defense in Thailand." Id.  The May 2010 bulletin identifies several Royal Thai Air Force Bases in Thailand, including Ubon. The designated Thailand bases include the Royal Thai Air Force Bases (RTAFB) of Korat, U-Tapao, Ubon, Nakhon Phanom, Udorn, Takhli, and Don Muang. See also VBA guidance document.  VA indicated that herbicide agent exposure may be acknowledged on a facts-found or direct basis if a United States Air Force Veteran served at one of the listed air bases as a security policeman, a security patrol dog handler, a member of a security police squadron, or otherwise served near the air base perimeter, as shown by his or her MOS, performance evaluations, or other credible evidence. If the facts allow for a finding of in-service herbicide agent exposure, then service connection will be presumed for the diseases associated with herbicide agent exposure listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).

In the present case, the Appellant asserts that the late Veteran's diagnosed heart disorder (coronary artery disease) is related to herbicide agent exposure during active duty. The Veteran's service records, and photographic evidence submitted show that the Veteran served at Ubon and Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Bases. The photograph presented at the January 2025 hearing shows the Veteran on the air strip in Thailand working on airplanes and with ammunition and cannisters. See January 2025 Hearing Transcript. The Appellant testified that the Veteran felt Agent Orange was on the planes that he was loading.  Id.  The Veteran also submitted a statement prior to his passing, indicating he was assigned the position of munitions handler at Ubon and Nakhon Phanom RTAFB.  See March 2020 Veteran Statement.  He detailed his duties required him to be on the flight line loading ammunition while other aircraft were landing, taking off, and taxiing.  He stated the two bases he was stationed at are listed by the VA as Agent Orange affected areas.  Id.  

The Veteran's military personnel record also demonstrates the Veteran was a weapons mechanic at Ubon RTAFB in 1968, performing inspections and repairs on weapons and loading and unloading ammunition in the gun pods. 

The Board acknowledges the May 2021 memorandum finding the VA lacked information required to verify herbicide exposure; however, they did not have access to the photograph provided at the hearing or the Appellant's testimony.

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent, certain diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e) will be considered service connected even though there is no record of such disease in service.   Coronary artery disease is among the listed disabilities attributable to herbicide exposure. It is a disease presumptively associated with herbicide agent exposure. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e).

The Board concludes that the Appellant's and Veteran's statements are competent and credible, as she is competent to report what the Veteran told her about the nature of his duties, and he is competent to report his duties while stationed in Thailand. The statements are credible as the details are consistent, and the statements are well supported by other evidence of record, to include the in-service personnel records and photographs described above.

The Board finds the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced as to the question of whether the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during service. The DD Form 214 and service personnel records reflect that the Veteran's military occupational specialty was weapons mechanic, and he was stationed at the RTAFB in Ubon and Nakhon-Phanom from October 1968 to October 1969. See DD Form 214 and June 1968 Notification of Permanent Change of Station.  Thus, based on the place, type, and circumstance of his service at Ubon and Nakhon-Pahnom RTFAB, and resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds his statements and the Appellant's statements are credible and sufficient to place the Veteran at the border of the Ubon and Nakhon Phanom RTAFB, exposing him to herbicide agents. 

As coronary artery disease is presumptively associated with herbicide agent exposure, service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, coronary artery disease, as a result of herbicide agent exposure, is warranted on a presumptive basis. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.309, 3.312.
