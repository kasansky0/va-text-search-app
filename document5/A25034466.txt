FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had an eating disorder at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that joint pains began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that pelvic congestion syndrome began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The Veteran's kidney pain is not secondary to any service-connected disability, and is not otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for an eating disorder are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for joint pains are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for service connection for pelvic congestion syndrome are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for service connection for kidney pain due to service or pelvic congestion syndrome are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served from August 2014 to August 2018, with subsequent service in the Reserves.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for low back pain and hair loss, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

1. Entitlement to service connection for an eating disorder

The Veteran seeks service connection for eating disorder.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2023. The Veteran reported that she felt pressure to meet weight requirements while serving in the USMC. The examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for disordered eating and/or an eating disorder. Therefore, the examiner concluded that the eating disorder is less likely than not due to service or to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to lack of diagnosis of an eating disorder.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of an eating disorder and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The December 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of pressure regarding her eating, the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of an eating disorder. Further, VA treatment records do not contain a diagnosis of an eating disorder.

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of an eating disorder, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for an eating disorder is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for joint pains

The Veteran seeks service connection for joint pain caused by hiking in the woods and hardball road. Because VA cannot identify the specific disability for which the Veteran is seeking compensation, the appeal must be denied.   

In this case, the Veteran has claimed that she has joint pain due to hiking in the woods. In December 2023, the RO requested clarification of the Veteran's specific joint locations in order to adjudicate the claim. In its April 2024 rating decision, the RO noted that clarification of the Veteran's specific joint locations was requested in order to adjudicate this claim. However, the Veteran did not respond to the request and no subsequent clarification has been received since the April 2024 rating decision.

In order to "identify the benefit sought" for the purpose of a claim, a claimant must describe the nature of the disability for which he or she is seeking benefits. The identification of the benefit sought does not require any technical precision. Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007). Rather, a claimant may identify the benefit sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability. Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009). In Brokowski, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that a reference to "all disabilities of record" was insufficient to satisfy the requirement under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) that an informal claim must "identify the benefit sought." Brokowski, 23 Vet. App. at 86.

Here, the Board notes that the Veteran has filed separate claims for specific joints, such as the low back, which have been separately adjudicated. However, without further specificity as to this claim that was certified to the Board, the Board cannot adjudicate the claim for "joint pains."

The Board notes that the duty to assist is a two-way street. A claimant may not passively wait for assistance in building a claim, but rather must actively assist VA in developing his claim. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991) (noting the duty to assist is a two-way street that requires a claimant's active participation in a claim for VA benefits). In this case, the Veteran was asked for clarification so that VA could consider her specific contentions. She did not provide any such clarification. Because VA cannot identify the specific disability for which the Veteran is seeking compensation, the appeal must be denied.

Additionally, in the April 2024 rating decision, the RO separately considered the Veteran's claim for a low back disability. Additionally, the Veteran is receiving separate compensation for right hip degenerative arthritis, left hip strain with degenerative arthritis, and lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy. Without further clarification from the Veteran, the Board cannot grant a separate claim of "joint pains," to do so could result in a pyramid of ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

3. Entitlement to service connection for pelvic congestion syndrome

The Veteran seeks service connection for pelvic congestion syndrome.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

Service treatment notes are silent for pelvic congestion syndrome. The Veteran reports that she was sexually assaulted in November 2017. An October 2018 treatment note reflects a normal second trimester pregnancy. A January 2019 ultrasound reflected concordant clinical and ultrasound gestational ages, with no evident fetal anomalies. No notation regarding pelvic congestion syndrome was noted by the clinician. A March 2019 discharge note reflected spontaneous vaginal delivery. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024. The Veteran reported that she was sexually assaulted and began to have pelvic pain. She related that she was unable to perform physical training. She reported pain, bloating, and constant aches. The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not related to or caused by the claimed in-service injury. The examiner explained that ultrasounds in 2015 and 2019 were negative for pelvic congestion syndrome. Instead, the examiner noted that medical records revealed diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome in 2022. Thus, the examiner concluded that the medical records did not support a nexus between pelvic congestion syndrome and the Veteran's pelvic pain in-service. The claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's pelvic congestion syndrome was less likely proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's musculoskeletal disabilities. The examiner explained that there was no objective evidence in the medical literature to support that musculoskeletal conditions causes pelvic congestion syndrome which is a circulatory condition.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome, and evidence supports finding that pelvic pain during service occurred, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

The January 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's pelvic congestion syndrome is not at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease, including pelvic pain during service. The examiner explained that 2015 and 2019 ultrasound imaging were negative for pelvic congestion syndrome. Therefore, there was no nexus between the Veteran's pelvic pain in service and her current pelvic congestion syndrome. Instead, the examiner noted a later diagnosis of pelvic congestion syndrome in 2022. The examiner's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

The Veteran believes the claimed pelvic congestion syndrome is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue. The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the January 2024 VA opinion.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for pelvic congestion syndrome is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

4. Entitlement to service connection for kidney pain

The Veteran seeks service connection for kidney pain as secondary to pelvic congestion syndrome. 

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, No. 2022-1239 (Fed. Cir. March 8, 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead held a "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

The Veteran's claimed pelvic congestion syndrome have been found herein to not be service-connected. A theory of entitlement based on secondary service connection is not possible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for hair loss 

The Veteran seeks service connection for hair loss. She contends that she was required to glue her hair back during service, and that she has permanent hair loss as a result. 

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination related to her claimed hair loss disorder. While the Veteran has not sought treatment for hair loss, she is competent to report hair loss as a symptom. Accordingly, the Board finds that a VA examination is warranted to determine the nature and etiology of any diagnosed hair loss disorder. See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

2. Entitlement to service connection for a low back pain 

The Veteran seeks service connection for low back pain.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024. The examiner opined that the Veteran's low back disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that there was no objective evidence of any back condition in service treatment records or medical records. 

The VA examiner, however, failed to address the Veteran's lay reports of her symptoms. The Board finds the January 2024 VA examination to be inadequate, as a medical examiner is not free to simply ignore a veteran's lay statements recounting symptoms or events. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error under the AMA, and remand is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination by a qualified medical professional to determine the nature and etiology of any identified hair loss disorder.

The examiner should identify any hair loss diagnosis.

Then, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the disorder had its onset during, or is otherwise related to, service.

The examiner should consider the lay report of needing to glue her hair back during her active-duty service.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's low back condition is at least as likely as not related to active-duty service.

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of her in-service injury and symptoms as well as his post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of her current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about his symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?
