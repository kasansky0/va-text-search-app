ORDER

Eligibility to the direct payment of fees to the appellant based on past due benefits awarded in a September 2020 rating decision granting an earlier effective date for the service connection of a right hip disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed an initial claim of entitlement to service connection for a right hip disorder in October 2000; the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claim in a September 2001 rating decision and the Veteran filed a timely October 2001 informal Notice of Disagreement (NOD) that was never adjudicated by the AOJ; based on a subsequent claim, the AOJ eventually issued a July 2007 rating decision granting entitlement to service connection for a right hip disorder from July 2003 and assigning an initial rating of 10 percent based on painful motion.

2. The appellant filed a valid Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 21-22a appointing him as the Veteran's representative before VA in December 2017, as well as an accompanying and duly signed fee agreement stipulating the direct payment of 20 percent of past due VA benefits awarded.

3. The Veteran filed a June 2019 VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) seeking a higher rating for degenerative joint disease; an August 2019 rating decision granted service connection for separate aspects of the Veteran's right hip disability, assigning noncompensable (0 percent) ratings for joint flexion and impairment while maintaining a 10 percent rating based on painful motion, listed under extension; the Veteran continuously pursued the appropriate rating from the August 2019 rating decision.  

4. The actions and arguments by the Veteran's attorney in the pursuit of this AMA appeal raised the issue of the appropriate date of claim for this higher rating; in a September 2020 rating decision, the AOJ found error in the AMA appeal process by finding that the date of claim extended to October 10, 2000.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees to the appellant from past due benefits awarded in a September 2020 rating decision granting entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 2000 for service connection of a right hip disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from June 1980 to November 1990; the appellant was his representative in other matters before VA.  The Veteran died in January 2025; however, despite his death adjudication of the appeal on the merits will continue pursuant to contested claims procedures.  This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a September 2020 Fee Decision issued by the AOJ regarding a rating decision granting an earlier effective date of October 2000 for service connection of a right hip disorder that was issued in August 2020, but due to a delay the notification letter was not mailed until September 2020 (hereinafter referred to as a September 2020 rating decision).  

Pursuant to these procedures, a redacted copy of the appellant's substantive appeal was sent to the Veteran's address on file.  Letters were also sent to each contested claimant in March 2021 and June 2021, informing them of their appellate rights and the docketing of the appeal at the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400-20.404.  In his VA Form 10182, the appellant selected the Hearing docket, and the Veteran did not select an alternative docket; both were then notified of the scheduling of a hearing before the Board.  The appellant testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge at a January 2024 virtual hearing, a transcript of which has been attached to the record; the Veteran did not appear for the hearing.

Per the AMA, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2020 Fee Decision on appeal and a brief or argument filed by the Veteran within 30 days of the March 2021 notice of the substance of the appellant's VA Form 10182, as well as any evidence submitted by the parties at the April 2024 hearing or within 90 days thereof.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.302(a), 20.405.  Finally, the Board denied the appellant eligibility to direct payment of fees in an April 2024 decision, which he appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In November 2024, the Court approved a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) agreed to by the parties and returned the case to the Board for readjudication consistent with the terms of the JMR.

1. Eligibility to the direct payment of fees to the appellant based on past due benefits awarded in a September 2020 rating decision granting an earlier effective date for the service connection of a right hip disorder

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 5904.  A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization [VSO] as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA and to authorize VA's disclosure of information to any person or organization representing a claimant before the Department.  Without the signature of a person providing representation for a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney, the appointment is invalid, and the person appointed to provide representation is under no obligation to do so.  

The power of attorney shall meet the following requirements: (1) Contain signature by: (i) The claimant, or (ii) The claimant's guardian, or (iii) In the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the following in the order named - spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; and (iv) An individual providing representation on a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney; and (2) Shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a).  A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time.  Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney.  38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney.  To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined.  Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past due benefits.  A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney.  A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA.  A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the AOJ within 30 days of its execution.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).  Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ initial decision with respect to the case.  This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.  38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  

An initial claim is any complete claim, other than a supplemental claim, for a benefit on a form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The first initial claim for one or more benefits received by VA is further defined as an original claim.  (See original claim, § 3.160(b)).  Id.  Initial claims include: (i) A new claim requesting service connection for a disability or grant of a new benefit, and (ii) A claim for increase in a disability evaluation rating or rate of a benefit paid based on a change or worsening in condition or circumstance since the last decision issued by VA for the benefit.  Id.  

Notably, in cases in which a Notice of Disagreement was filed on or before June 19, 2007, agents and attorneys may charge fees only for services provided after both of the following conditions have been met: (i) A final decision was promulgated by the Board with respect to the issue, or issues, involved in the appeal; and (ii) The agent or attorney was retained not later than 1 year following the date that the decision by the Board was promulgated.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(2). 

The AMA applies to all claims originally decided after February 19, 2019.  See Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017).  Under the AMA, a claimant has three administrative review options for an adverse decision which must be filed within one year from notice of a decision - 1) a request for Higher Level Review (HLR), 2) an appeal to the Board, or 3) the filing of a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  Timely filing an appropriate administrative review option under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 may preserve an effective date from a claim which is continuously pursued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).  VA also intended for the AMA to broadly recognize three types of claims: a supplemental claim, an initial claim, and a claim for increase.  84 Fed. Reg. 138, 139 (Jan 18, 2019).

However, the Court has held that VA regulations governing administrative review options are claims processing rules, see Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021), and recently held that a supplemental claim need not be filed on a specific VA form.  See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20 (March 13, 2025).  

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection.  The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision.  If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase.  38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

In this case, the Veteran first filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for a right hip disorder in October 2000, asserting that arthritis had "spread" from his service-connected right knee to his right hip.  The AOJ denied this claim in a September 2001 rating decision, and the Veteran filed an informal NOD in October 2001, stating he was told on active duty that his "arthritis will spread into right hip, I know it has."  The AOJ never acknowledged receipt of this NOD and did not issue a Statement of the Case in response.  The Veteran subsequently submitted July 2003 statements that were interpreted by the AOJ to be an informal claim to reopen service connection of the right hip, declining to reopen the claim in December 2003 based on a lack of new and material evidence.  After the Veteran submitted additional evidence in November 2004, the AOJ continued the denial in a February 2006 rating decision before ultimately issuing a July 2007 rating decision granting service connection from the date of receipt of the July 2003 statements; it also assigned an initial 10 percent rating based on painful motion.

The appellant was appointed as representative in December 2017, but the Veteran continued to submit numerous filings on his own initiative.  In June 2019, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim stating only "degenerative joint disease," that the AOJ interpreted to include a higher rating for his right hip disability.  

At this juncture, the Board notes that the rating code sheet reflected a single 10 percent rating for degenerative joint disease of the right hip, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5299-5252, effective July 11, 2003.  Included within 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a are multiple DCs that evaluate impairment resulting from service-connected hip disorders, including DC 5250 (ankylosis), DC 5251 (limitation of thigh extension), DC 5252 (limitation of thigh extension), DC 5253 (limitation of thigh abduction, adduction or rotation), DC 5254 (flail joint) and DC 5255 (malunion or nonunion). 

The AOJ has a practice of assigning separate ratings for impairment in different planes of motion, or any diagnostic, as long as there is no duplicative or overlapping symptomatology.  See generally VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; VAOPGCPREC 23-97; Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017); Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994). 

In an August 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for different aspects of the Veteran's right hip disability, separating it into joint flexion, extension and impairment; noncompensable ratings were assigned for flexion and impairment while the existing 10 percent rating was continued for painful motion and listed under extension.  

From here, the record reflects multiple different attempts to pursue a higher rating for the right hip on a variety of different forms.  Given the recent holding Chisholm, the Board boils down this complicated array of filings to what is necessary for this decision.  

At the time of the June 2019 application, the AOJ had not recognized any pending appeal with respect to the right hip disability.  The August 2019 AOJ decision was clearly subject to AMA rights.  38 C.F.R § 19.2(a)-(b) (2024) (in effect for claims on or after February 19, 2019). 

The August 2019 HLR administrative review request broadly listed the area of dispute as "INCREASES FOR HIP CONDITIONS" which led to an October 2020 HLR decision continuing the ratings currently in effect.  Amongst the various confusing filings after this decision, the Veteran submitted an administrative review option of a supplemental claim in October 2019 specifically identifying a point of dispute that the Veteran should received a rating under DC 5255 - or another aspect of right hip disability in general.  This is continuous pursuit of the August 2019 AOJ decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

A November 2019 AOJ decision denied any change in the prior ratings.  In January 2020, the Veteran submitted an administrative review option of an HLR review again identifying a point of dispute that the Veteran should receive a rating under DC 5255.  There remains continuous pursuit of the August 2019 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

An April 2020 HLR denied any change in the prior ratings.  The Veteran submitted an administrative review option of a Board appeal in May 2020 reflecting continuous pursuit of the August 2019 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Notably, this appeal was eventually dismissed due to the Veteran's death.

A confusing aspect of this case concerns an August 2020 AOJ rating decision which, in the Introduction section, indicated that it was responding to an October 17, 2001, Notice of Disagreement.  The AOJ granted an effective date of October 10, 2000, for service connection for degenerative joint disease of right hip joints, and assigned a 10 percent rating effective October 10, 2000, under DC 5251.  The AOJ indicated that it was correcting a wrong effective date of award assigned in an earlier decision, that attempts at an Informal Conference had not been successful, but that the August 2020 decision "is a result" of the October 2019 Decision Review Officer (DRO) filing.  Yet, the AOJ provided a notice letter on September 10, 2020, decision which provided AMA rights of appeal.

The JMR instructed the Board to discuss the body of the September 2020 rating decision, which noted that the appellant filed an October 2019 legacy NOD requesting review by a Decision Review Officer and that the unadjudicated October 2001 NOD leading to the earlier effective date grant was discovered by the AOJ "as a result of that review."  

In another appeal stream, the Veteran's attorney argued that the Veteran was entitled to an NOD in the Legacy system for a TDIU claim.  See generally Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

The Board first finds that the December 2017 VA 21-22a appointing the appellant as the Veteran's representative before VA was valid, and that a duly signed fee agreement stipulating the direct payment of past due benefits was concurrently submitted.  The Board next finds that the Veteran continuously pursued the appropriate rating for his right hip disability since the August 2019 AOJ rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

The actions and arguments by the Veteran's attorney in the pursuit of this AMA appeal raised the issue of the appropriate date of claim for this higher rating - essentially raising the issue of a non-final decision in the Legacy realm.  In light of Chisholm, the Board will disregard the manner of how this issue was raised. 

The retroactive actions by the AOJ, in essence, determined that the date of claim for the AMA appeal stems from an error in not recognizing an NOD filed in the Legacy system prior to the date of attorney.  The Board acknowledges that there is no eligibility for attorney fees for an appeal submitted prior to June 2007, see 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(3), and that the retroactive actions by the AOJ technically recognized a pending Legacy appeal prior to June 2007.  However, in Held v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 28 (2023), the Court found eligibility for attorney fees in an AMA appeal based on a revision of a Legacy claim based on clear and unmistakable error).  Similarly, the AMA appeal stream led to correcting a wrong effective date of award in a prior Legacy decision.  The Board does not find applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(3) in this scenario.  Overall, the Board finds that the appeal originated as an AMA appeal and, in that process, the AOJ found that the actual date of claim was October 10, 2000.  The Board finds that entitlement to attorney fees is warranted, and the claim is granted.

At the April 2024 Board hearing, the appellant, apparently unclear as to the issue on appeal, primarily discussed a previous unrelated Fee Decision and stated the AOJ had informed him he was owed $1980.02 in additional fees per a November 2018 Summary of the Case.  The Board observes that the sole issue presently on appeal is the direct payment of fees September 2020 Fee Decision as identified in the VA Form 10182 appeal.
