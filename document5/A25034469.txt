2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a left hand condition, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a right wrist condition, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a left wrist condition, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a right hip condition, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a left hip condition, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

7. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has scars on his wrists and shoulders, to include functional impairment resulting in impairment of earning capacity, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 2009 to June 2013. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in the January rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record in conjunction with this case. However, the Board has limited its discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008). Thus, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim on appeal.

1. Entitlement to service connection for right hand condition is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hand condition is denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right wrist condition is denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for left wrist condition is denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for right hip condition is denied.

6. Entitlement to service connection for left hip condition is denied.

7. Entitlement to service connection for scars on wrists and shoulders (also claimed as body) is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hand, wrist, and hip conditions, as well as scars on his wrists and shoulders, as the result of his military service. May 2023 and June 2023 VA Forms 21-526EZ. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from injury or disease that was incurred in, or aggravated by, military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after a veteran's discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a Veteran's disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A Veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). Lay evidence may establish a diagnosis of a simple medical condition, a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or symptoms that later support a diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377.

The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible or worthy of belief. Barr, supra. Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination about the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno, supra. 

The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence considering the entirety of the record. In this regard, the Board may properly consider internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, bias, self-interest, internal consistency, and consistency with other evidence of record submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511-12 (1995); Southall-Norman v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 346, 355 (2016).

Therefore, in rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA compensation. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997). The current disability requirement is satisfied when a claimant "has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim," McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); or "when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to... filing a claim for benefits based on that disability." Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

A careful and thorough review of the Veteran's post-service medical records reflect that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of any hand, wrist, or hip conditions, nor did he have any such diagnosis at any time during the period on appeal. There is also no evidence of record that reflects complaints or treatment of symptoms related to any hand, wrist, or hip condition. An April 2023 VA scars examination found no scars on the Veteran's trunk or extremities. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that he has such conditions. Nevertheless, while he is competent to report the observable physical symptoms of these disabilities, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis or medical opinion. See Barr, supra. These issues are medically complex and require specialized medical education and knowledge of the interaction between multiple systems in the body as well as the ability to interpret complicated diagnostic medical testing. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4; 38 U.S.C. § 1110. 

In denying the Veteran's claim, the Board acknowledges that no medical examination was obtained regarding the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for any hand, wrist, or hip condition. However, the Veteran has not provided evidence that he has a diagnosis of any hand, wrist, or hip condition. Accordingly, the Board finds that VA examinations and opinions are not necessary to decide the claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Therefore, as there are no current diagnoses of any hand, wrist, or hip conditions, nor any evidence of scars of the wrists or shoulders, at any time during the pendency of the appeal, the medical evidence does not support service connection for the claims and there is no doubt to be otherwise resolved.

Finally, as to all claims, the Board recognizes in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity." In this instance, the Board finds the weight of both the medical and lay evidence is against a finding the Veteran's hand, wrist, or hip pain causes functional impairment.  The Veteran has not presented any evidence, including his statements, that his pain has resulted in diminished function or impairment of earning capacity.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
