ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A November 2023 Board decision granted a 10 percent rating, but no higher, for service-connected right knee instability and a December 2023 rating decision effectuated the grant of benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee instability have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7104; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.1100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1966 to August 1968 with service in Vietnam from August 1967 to July 1968. The Appellant is the surviving spouse of the Veteran and has been substituted as the claimant in this matter to complete the processing of the deceased Veteran's claims.  

In November 2023, the Board granted a 10 percent rating, but no higher, for right knee instability. That decision was effectuated by a December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision. In October 2024 the appellant attempted to appeal, by submitting a Notice of Disagreement (NOD).

However, this issue must be dismissed as a matter of law. The Board recognizes the holding in Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 31 (2023) (finding that a Board decision is the final and conclusive determination of the Secretary as to any discrete issue decided in that decision, and a pure implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits). A rating decision that implements a grant of benefits by the Board is not a "decision" for appeal purposes, as the issue has already been determined by another part of the agency. Rather, such a rating decision is merely ministerial in nature. Id.

Because the December 2023 AOJ decision that effectuated the Board decision was not appealable to the Board, the Board cannot accept the October 2024 NOD as to that issue. Accordingly, the appeal to that issue is dismissed as a matter of law.

As for the other issues listed on the appellant's NOD, the Board notes that the November 2023 Board decision also denied service connection for a kidney disability and atrophied testicle. A VA Form 10182 cannot be used to appeal a Board decision, and, as such, those issues are not currently on appeal.
