ORDER

Service connection for vitiligo is granted.

Service connection for chronic hemorrhoids is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his vitiligo was incurred during his active service.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his chronic hemorrhoids are the result of his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria have been met to establish service connection for vitiligo. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.309.

2. The criteria have been met to establish service connection for chronic hemorrhoids. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1970 to May 1971. The Veteran also had reserve service through June 1974.

A rating decision regarding the Veteran's service connection claim for chronic hemorrhoids was issued in April 2020, and a rating decision regarding the Veteran's service connection claim for vitiligo was issued in July 2021; these constitute initial decisions, and therefore by law, the modernized review system, governed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In April 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of the April 2020 rating decision. In June 2021, a Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. A rating decision was issued in August 2021 that continued to deny the service connection claim for chronic hemorrhoids.

In July 2022, the Veteran filed a second VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, and requested review of the July 2021 and August 2021 rating decisions.

Regarding the Veteran's service connection claim for vitiligo, in September 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the Higher-Level Review rating decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2021 rating decision. 

Regarding the Veteran's service connection claim for chronic hemorrhoids, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. A supplemental claim rating decision was issued in March 2023 that continued to deny the service connection claim for chronic hemorrhoids.

In a September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed both the September 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions and elected the Evidence Submission docket. By law, for claims appealed in this docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2021 rating decision, which was subject to a Higher-Level Review, and the March 2023 supplemental claim rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, then, by law, the Board was not permitted to consider that evidence in this decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

In the July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted and then readjudicated the service connection claim for vitiligo. The Board has no reason to question this favorable finding. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).

In the March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted and then readjudicated the service connection claim for chronic hemorrhoids. The Board has no reason to question this favorable finding. See 38?U.S.C. §?5104A; 38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).

Service Connection

Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted for a disability due to a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

To substantiate a claim of service connection there must be competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a claimed disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in active service; and (3) a causal relationship between the present claimed disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Vitiligo

Factual Background

The Veteran asserted that his vitiligo began during active service. He reported that during training in early 1971, he was diagnosed with vitiligo.

In August 2016, P.R. reported that he served with the Veteran. P.R. reported that the Veteran went to sick call and was diagnosed with vitiligo.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not reflect a diagnosis of vitiligo.

The Veteran's post-service medical records show that he was treated for vitiligo in June 2012.

In October 2016, the Veteran's physician completed a Disability Benefits Questionnaire. His physician indicated that the Veteran was diagnosed with vitiligo in January 1971. His physician reported that the Veteran had close to whole body involvement of his vitiligo.

In June 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner reported that the Veteran was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1971 during his basic training. The examiner noted that the Veteran's vitiligo affected practically his entire body. While the examiner provided a negative opinion regarding the cause of the Veteran's vitiligo, the examiner simply concluded that the Veteran's vitiligo was due to another cause rather than his active service. While the examiner referenced a medical article, the examiner did not explain how the medical article applied to the facts of the Veteran or provide a sufficient rationale for the negative opinion.

Analysis

After a complete review of the entire record, although the Veteran's STRs do not include reports of or treatment for vitiligo symptoms, the Board finds no reason to doubt the Veteran's credibility regarding the onset and persistence of his observable vitiligo symptoms. The Veteran and P.R. provided competent and credible reports about the onset and persistence of the Veteran's objectively observable vitiligo symptoms, and the Board assigns significant probative value to these statements. As such, an in-service diagnosis of vitiligo is demonstrated.

The weight of the evidence establishes that the Veteran's vitiligo symptoms began during his active service, and the Board therefore finds that the Veteran's vitiligo was incurred during his active service. In reaching this conclusion, the reports of the Veteran and P.R. regarding this condition in service that continued to the present are found to be competent, credible, and highly probative.

The VA examiner provided a negative opinion for this condition. However, the examiner provided no rationale for the opinion and failed to address the lay statements of the Veteran and P.R. regarding the onset of vitiligo during his active service. In addition, the examination report is internally inconsistent because the examiner reported that the Veteran was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1971 but then opined that the Veteran's vitiligo was not due to his active service. Accordingly, the opinion of the VA examiner regarding the Veteran's vitiligo cannot be assigned significant probative value.

As such, the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's vitiligo began during his active service and persisted since his active service. Accordingly, the criteria are met to establish service connection for vitiligo, and the claim is granted.

Chronic Hemorrhoids

Factual Background

The Veteran asserted that his hemorrhoids began during active service. 

The Veteran's STRs show that at his May 1970 entrance physical, he reported having occasional hemorrhoids. On examination, he had normal findings of his anus and rectum with no hemorrhoids noted.

When no pre-existing condition was "noted" upon entry into service, a veteran is presumed to have entered service in sound condition, and the burden falls to the government to demonstrate by clear and unmistakable evidence both that (a) the condition pre-existed service and (b) the pre-existing condition was not aggravated by service. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 234 (2012); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1132 (presumption of sound condition upon entrance to service). "[I]f a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder."  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096; see also 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. 

In this context, for a pre-existing condition to have been "noted" means that it must be recorded in the entrance examination report. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b); see 38 U.S.C. § 1132; Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 245 (1994). History of pre-service existence of a disease does not constitute a notation of the condition. Id. at 240. However, the disease need not be symptomatic at the time of the entrance examination, so long as a diagnosis is provided. See Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529, 530 (1996) (holding that "bunions" were noted at induction examination where the orthopedic examiner diagnosed "bunions," despite also stating "no problem [with] feet.").

Here, while the Veteran reported a pre-service history of occasional hemorrhoids, he had a normal entrance physical with no hemorrhoids noted at the time. As such, the presumption of soundness attaches to the Veteran regarding any hemorrhoid disability. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Veteran has not submitted any medical evidence showing that he clearly and unmistakably was diagnosed with this condition prior to his active service.

The Veteran's STRs show that he was treated for hemorrhoids in March 1971, during his active service.

STRs from the Veteran's reserve service show that at an April 1972 reserve service physical, he had several hemorrhoids.

In August 2021, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with hemorrhoids. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hemorrhoids "clearly and unmistakably" pre-existed his active service but that there was no evidence of permanent aggravation beyond normal progression. The examiner reported that the Veteran had hemorrhoids at an April 1972 examination.

The Veteran's post-service medical records show that he was treated for hemorrhoids in December 2019 and January 2021.

In December 2022, a VA examiner reviewed the Veteran's claims file. The examiner opined that the Veteran's hemorrhoids "clearly and unmistakably" pre-existed his active service but that there was no evidence of permanent aggravation beyond normal progression.

Analysis

After a complete review of the entire record, the Board finds no reason to doubt the Veteran's credibility and accuracy regarding the onset and persistence of his observable hemorrhoid symptoms.

The weight of the evidence establishes that his hemorrhoids symptoms began during his active service, and the Board therefore finds that the Veteran's chronic hemorrhoid disability was incurred during his active service. In reaching this conclusion, the reports of the Veteran regarding his symptoms in service that continued to the present are found to be competent, credible, and highly probative. In addition, the Veteran's STRs establishes that he received treatment for hemorrhoids during his active service, afterwards during his reserve service, and continuing to the present.

While the August 2021 and December 2022 VA examiners provided negative opinions, both VA examiners impermissibly used the wrong legal standard for their negative opinions when they found that the Veteran's hemorrhoids clearly and unmistakably pre-existed the Veteran's active service, apparently based on the Veteran's own self reports and not on any objective medical evidence. In addition, despite finding the Veteran's hemorrhoids clearly and unmistakably pre-existed the Veteran's active service, neither VA examiner discussed the Veteran's active service entrance physical in May 1970 demonstrating normal findings his anus and rectum with no hemorrhoids noted. Furthermore, neither examiner discussed the significance of the Veteran's treatment for hemorrhoids during his active service in March 1971. Finally, the August 2021 VA examiner relied on the Veteran's reserve service physical in April 1972 as a basis for the opinion. Neither VA examiner addressed the Veteran's lay statements of ongoing hemorrhoids symptoms since active service and continuing to the present. Accordingly, the opinions of the August 2021 and December 2022 VA examiners cannot be assigned significant probative value.

As such, the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's chronic hemorrhoid disability began during his active service and persisted since his active service. Accordingly, the criteria are met to establish service connection for chronic hemorrhoids, and the claim is granted.
