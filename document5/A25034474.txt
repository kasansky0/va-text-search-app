ORDER

The Board's October 2024 Decision which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for left knee condition is vacated.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2024, the Board issued a decision that denied service connection for a left knee condition.

2. Two months later, in December 2024, the Veteran's Counsel filed a Motion to Vacate based upon a conclusion that the Board failed to consider medical evidence documenting treatment for a left knee condition.

3. Upon reconsideration of the relevant evidence, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran suffers from a left knee disability, to include as causally related to active service or an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Vacatur, of the Board's October 2024 decision that denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7103 (c), 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904.

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Air Force from November 2009 to November 2012.

Pursuant to an April 2022 Rating Decision, the rating office (RO) increased the assigned evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected headache syndrome from non-compensable to 30 percent disabling, effective September 29, 2021.  That decision also denied the Veteran's claim for an evaluation in excess of 10 percent disabling for left hallux valgus prior to September 29, 2021. Claims for service connection for a left knee condition and right hallux valgus were also denied.

Thereafter, the Veteran timely appealed the April 2022 rating decision to the Board via VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and requested direct review of the evidence considered by a Veterans Law Judge.  The Veteran declined to submit any additional evidence.

Pursuant to an October 2024 Board decision, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an evaluation of 30 percent disabling for headache syndrome, prior to September 29, 2021, was denied.  That decision also denied an evaluation of 10 percent disabling for left hallux valgus prior to September 29, 2021.  The Veteran's claims for service connection for right hallux valgus and for a left knee condition were also denied.

In December 2024, Counsel filed a Motion to Vacate the above referenced Board decision to the extent that it denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a left knee condition.

1. The Board's October 2024 Decision which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for left knee condition is vacated

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the Veteran or his representative, or on the Board's own motion, when a Veteran has been denied due process of law or when benefits were allowed based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904.

As noted above, an October 2024 Board decision denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition. 

Two months later, the Veteran's Counsel filed a Motion to Vacate. Therein, Counsel alleged that the Board failed to consider evidence documenting treatment for a left knee condition.  In support of the stated argument, Counsel called attention to a January 2022 treatment record which documented left knee flare-ups and functional loss due to pain.  It was further suggested that given the above, the Veteran is entitled to a VA examination to determine whether his left knee condition is secondarily related to his service-connected orthopedic conditions.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the October 2024 Decision which denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition, to include as secondarily to his service-connected orthopedic conditions was deficient.  

Therefore, the October 2024 Board decision is vacated to the limited extent noted above. 

Service connection, generally

Service connection may be granted for any current disability that is the result of a disease contracted or an injury sustained while on active-duty service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (a), 3.304 (2020).

Entitlement to service connection benefits is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (the medical 'nexus' requirement).  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a) (2020).

Service connection also is permissible on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a) and (b) (2020).  See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).  In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability.  See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Furthermore, in determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs pervasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (2020); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt will be given to the Veteran. Id.

The Board notes that it has thoroughly reviewed the record in conjunction with this case.  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence submitted by the Veteran or on his behalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 129 (2000) (noting that the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant).  

Lay evidence, if competent and credible, may serve to establish a nexus in certain circumstances.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009) (noting that lay evidence is not incompetent merely for lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  When considering whether lay evidence may be competent, the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the Veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "[w]heter lay evidence is competent and sufficient in a particular case is a factual issue.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to service connection a left knee condition. As discussed in further detail below, the evidence weighs pervasively against the claims.

In analyzing her claim, the threshold inquiry for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury or disease.

On review of the record, the Board concludes that while service treatment records document sporadic complaints of bilateral knee symptoms, the evidence weighs pervasively against finding that that the Veteran suffers from a current diagnosis of a left knee disability as causally related to active service.

Service treatment records noting sporadic complaints of left knee pain were reported in connection with prolonged marching while wearing boots. No formal diagnosis or reference to a chronic condition was identified.  No disqualifying abnormalities impacting the left knee were documented at separation.

Post-service treatment records are largely silent for complaints of left knee pain.  A single reference to left knee and thigh pain was noted in January 2022. There was no evidence of a chronic condition, a basis for a formal diagnosis, or other evidence of a left knee abnormality.

The Board observes that the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination of the left knee. 

In determining whether the duty to assist requires that a VA medical examination be provided, or medical opinion obtained with respect to a veteran's claim for benefits, there are four factors for consideration.  These four factors are:  (1)whether there is competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) whether there is evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or evidence establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumption period; (3) whether there is an indication that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) whether there otherwise is sufficient competent medical evidence of record to make a decision on the claim.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38U.S.C. §5103A(d); 38C.F.R. §3.159(c)(4).  With respect to the third factor above, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has stated that this element establishes a low threshold and requires only that the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between the current disability or symptoms and the veteran's service.

Regarding the Veteran's left knee, a medical examination would serve no useful purpose as the requirement of an in-service disease or injury to establish a service connection claim cannot be met upon additional examination.  The Veteran was not prejudiced by the lack of VA examination.

The Board has reviewed and fully considered Counsel's argument, that a January 2022 treatment record documented complaints of left knee flare-ups of pain and functional loss due to pain.  It was further suggested that given the above, the Veteran is entitled to a VA examination to determine whether his left knee condition is secondarily related to his service-connected orthopedic conditions.

On review of the record, the Board finds that a VA examination is not warranted.  Even if the Veteran now suffers from sporadic bouts of left knee, to include in relation to his service-connected orthopedic conditions, to date, a formal diagnosis has not been rendered.  The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Consideration has been given to the holding in Saunders which noted that evidence of pain alone that results in functional impairment, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, can constitute a disability. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) stated further that the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability."

Later, in Wait v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) addressed the question of what is necessary for a claimant to demonstrate that his or her pain or other symptoms cause "functional impairment of earning capacity," and therefore meet the current disability requirement under Saunders. Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020). CAVC held that, to meet the current disability requirement under Saunders, "there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity, which may include showing manifestations of a similar severity, frequency, and duration as those VA has determined by regulation would cause impaired earning capacity in an average person." This requires the Board to make a factual determination whether the Veteran's manifestations rise to the level of a functional impairment in earning capacity.  Here, even after considering Saunders, and the clarifications noted in Wait, service connection for a left knee disability is not warranted in this case.

In making all determinations, the Board has fully considered all lay and medical evidence of record. Generally, lay statements may be competent to support a claim for service connection where the events or the presence of a disability or related symptoms are subject to lay observation. 38 U.S.C. § 1153(a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. §3.303(a), 3.159(a) (2020); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

While sporadic complaints of knee pain were documented in service, no formal diagnosis, a chronic condition, or a disqualifying abnormality impacting the left knee was found at separation.  Post service treatment records reference isolated complaints of inner thigh/knee pain in January 2022.  To date, no chronic condition or a formal diagnosis has been documented, and there is no evidence of functional impairment so great as to result in a reduction in earning capacity.

The Board recognizes the Veteran's competence to report on her current symptoms and their onset.  However, there is no evidence that she possesses the specialized skills and expertise necessary to render complex medical opinions or opine as to the nature and etiology of her current symptoms.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377.  Further, mere conclusory or generalized lay assertions that an in-service event or illness caused a current disability are insufficient to establish nexus in the absence of competent medical evidence.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010).

Accordingly, as the evidence weighs pervasively against the claim, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) regarding reasonable doubt are inapplicable. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability must be denied.
