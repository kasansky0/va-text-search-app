REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1967 to December 1968.?? 

This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) from a June 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).?? The Appellant timely appealed this decision to the Board in June 2023 by filing a notice of disagreement (NOD) in which she requested Direct Review.? 

The Board notes that when a Direct Review?appeal under the AMA is requested, the record closes on the date of notice of the rating decision on appeal. Here, a notification letter for the June 2023 rating decision is not in the claims file.

While defects in notice can serve to render a claim non-final, defects of decisional notes are cured when the record demonstrates that the claimant and the claimant's representative actually received notice of the decision. Sellers v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 265 (2012); Wiker v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 199 (2023) (noting that even if notice of a decision is deficient in some way, finality still attaches where there is "actual knowledge" of the requisite information).

A review of the evidence of record demonstrates that the Appellant had actual knowledge of the June 2023 rating decision. The Appellant timely appealed the rating decision in her NOD wherein she specifically indicated she was appealing the June 2023 rating decision. Thus, the record closed on the date of this rating decision, June 13, 2023.

SERVICE CONNECTION

Generally, to establish service connection a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."?Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 131516 (Fed. Cir. 2009);?Shedden?v.?Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).?????? 

Service connection may also be granted for certain chronic diseases if manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of separation from active service.?38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113 (2012);?38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309.? If there is no evidence of a chronic condition during service or the applicable presumptive period, then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service may serve as an alternative method of establishing the second and/or third element of?a?service?connection claim.?See?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b);?Savage v. Gober, 10?Vet. App.?488 (1997).?????? 

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.?38?U.S.C. §?1154(a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.?Jandreau?v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).?????? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran.?38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §?3.102;?see?Gilbert v.?Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?49, 53 (1990).??? 

1. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD for accrued benefits purposes.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus for accrued benefits purposes.

3. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss for accrued benefits purposes.

The Appellant seeks entitlement to accrued benefits for service connection for PTSD, tinnitus, and hearing loss. 

Claims for VA benefits do not survive a claimant's death. However, a qualified survivor, including a spouse, may carry on the deceased Veteran's claim for benefits by submitting an application for accrued benefits within one year after the Veteran's death.

Accrued benefits are periodic monetary benefits to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions or those based on evidence in the file at date of death. 38 U.S.C. § 5121(a), (c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000. An accrued-benefits claim incorporates any prior final adjudication on claims brought by a Veteran, because it derives from the Veteran's claims. Claims proceeding on the basis of substitution have a similar legal basis, with the primary difference being that substitute claimants have the ability to supplement the record.

For a claimant to prevail in an accrued benefits claim, the record must show that: (1) the Appellant has standing to file a claim for accrued benefits; (2) the Veteran had a claim pending at the time of death; (3) the Veteran would have prevailed on the claim if the Veteran had not died; and (4) the claim for accrued benefits was filed within one year of the Veteran's death.

The Veteran filed his claims for service connection for PTSD, tinnitus, and hearing loss in September 2022. The Veteran died in December 2022, before the AOJ could issue a rating decision or provide the Veteran with VA examinations. In February 2023, within one year of the Veteran's death, the Appellant filed a VA Form 21-0847 Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant.  The AOJ approved substitution of the Veteran's spouse as the Appellant and issued a rating decision in June 2023 based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death. 

Prior to his death, the record contained service treatment and military personnel records, VA treatment records, and lay statements from the Veteran. Favorable findings from the June 2023 rating decision include that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of boatswain's mate concedes exposure to hazardous noise.

When filing his claims in September 2022, the Veteran provided lay statements. He indicated on his VA Form 21-526EZ Fully Developed Claim that his tinnitus was due to loud noise exposure. He also provided a separate document wherein he described his PTSD symptoms, which included nightmares, flashbacks, insomnia, and fear, and stated while serving in Vietnam he was bothered when people got hurt, that he got hurt himself, and that he had "close calls."

VA treatment records do not show treatment, complaints, or diagnoses of hearing loss or tinnitus. Regarding his PTSD claim, although these records show the Veteran was screened for PTSD and depression on multiple occasions, it does not show treatment or diagnosis of a mental health condition. Although the Veteran had a score of 5, indicating mild depression, on his depression screening in January 2014, he denied symptoms of PTSD and depression on subsequent occasions, to include in March 2017 (PTSD and depression scores of 0), February 2020 (depression score of 0), and June 2022 (PTSD score of 0 and depression score of 1).

Although VA examinations for his claimed conditions were scheduled, the Veteran was unavailable and attempted to reschedule his examinations. Unfortunately, as noted above, the Veteran died before he could attend a VA examination. 

The Board concludes that there is no credible evidence the Veteran had a diagnosis or disability of tinnitus and hearing loss, or a mental health condition at the time of his death, or that he had one at any time during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claims. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). 

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements concerning his claimed disabilities. The Board acknowledges that he is competent to give evidence about what he experiences. See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). The Veteran, however, is not competent to diagnose hearing loss for VA purposes because this requires expertise in the administration of audiological testing, diagnose a mental health condition, or to provide nexus opinions, as his claimed disabilities may be due to many different causes thereby rendering the question of causation a matter of medical complexity requiring medical expertise to resolve. The Veteran was also never evaluated to confirm whether any ringing in his ears was consistent with noise-induced tinnitus. 

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. The benefit of the doubt rule does not apply as the evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal." As such, the Appellant's claims for service connection for PTSD, tinnitus, and hearing loss, for accrued benefits purposes, must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
