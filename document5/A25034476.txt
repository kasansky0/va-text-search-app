CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for payment of DEA benefits prior to December 5, 2022, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3512, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021, 21.3041.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Army from May 1979 to June 1998.  The Appellant is the Veteran's child.

The administrative decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in June 2023.  In a timely VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) received in July 2023, the Appellant elected the Direct Review option for this appeal; therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence in the record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Entitlement to payment of DEA benefits prior to December 5, 2022

Basic eligibility for DEA benefits can be established in several ways, including being the child of a veteran who has a total disability, permanent in nature, resulting from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1)(A)(ii); 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a)(3)(i). 

In general, eligibility for DEA benefits derived from a veteran with a permanent and total disability begins on the child's 18th birthday, or on the successful completion of the child's secondary schooling, whichever occurs first.  38 U.S.C. § 3512; 38 C.F.R. § 21.3041(a).  Where a veteran is found to be permanently and totally disabled after the child's 18th birthday and before the child's 26th birthday, the child can elect the beginning date of eligibility for DEA benefits, choosing either the effective date of the veteran's total and permanent rating, the date of notification, or any date in between.  38 U.S.C. § 3512(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 21.3041.  The election must be made within 60 days of VA's written notice to the child; if no election is made, the beginning date will be the date of VA's decision that the veteran has a permanent and total disability.  38 C.F.R. § 21.3041(i)(2).

Retroactive payment of DEA benefits may be awarded in certain circumstances.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3512, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 21.4131.  Specifically, the governing statute provides an exception to the general effective date rules, as follows:  if VA awards the Veteran permanent and total disability and an eligible person files an application for DEA benefits within one year of that decision, the DEA application may be considered as having been filed on the Veteran's basic eligibility date, provided that the eligible person would otherwise have been entitled to such educational assistance for an approved program of education at that earlier time.  38 U.S.C. § 5113(b).

In this case, the Appellant's basic eligibility for DEA benefits as the Veteran's daughter is not in dispute, as she has been found eligible for these benefits.  Rather, the dispute in this case is the effective date for payment of such benefits.  

On December 5, 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision finding the Veteran permanently and totally disabled and establishing basic eligibility to DEA benefits based on permanent and total disability status from February 11, 2019.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision in a December 2022 notice letter.

In February 2023, the Appellant filed a claim for DEA benefits, reporting attendance at an educational institution from August 2015 to July 2020, where she earned her bachelor degree and masters degree in tax accounting.

On February 14, 2023, the AOJ issued the Appellant a certificate of eligibility for DEA benefits and instructed her to elect a beginning date for her benefits.  The letter informed the Appellant that her choices were February 11, 2019, the date the Veteran became totally disabled for VA purposes; December 5, 2022, the date of the rating decision finding the Veteran permanently and totally disabled; or any date between those two dates.  The letter informed the Appellant that the AOJ had temporarily chosen December 5, 2022, and that the Appellant had 60 days from the date of the letter to choose a different beginning date.  The letter informed the Appellant that, if her selection of a different date was not received within that 60-day period, the AOJ would select the December 5, 2022, date as the beginning date for the Appellant's DEA benefits, which could not later be changed.  The letter included a form for the Appellant to return in order to make her election, which also included a notice that the election must be received within the 60-day period.

On May 30, 2023, the Appellant mailed her beginning date election, and it was received by VA on June 9, 2023.  The Appellant chose February 11, 2019, as her beginning date.

In June 2023, the AOJ informed the Appellant that her permanent start date is December 5, 2022, as her election was not received within 60 days from the date she was notified.  

The Appellant filed this appeal in response to the June 2023 notice letter.  The Veteran submitted a written statement, asserting that the 60-day period was missed due to extenuating personal circumstances, including dental and medical procedures.  

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the appeal must be denied.

The Appellant was born in January 1997; she turned 18 prior to the effective date of the Veteran's permanent and total rating, and was not yet 26 when the Veteran was found to be permanently and totally disabled.  As the Appellant filed her claim for DEA benefits within a year of the December 2022 rating decision, she is eligible to receive retroactive DEA benefits for training completed after the basic eligibility date.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5113(b).

However, after receiving notice of the opportunity to elect a beginning date earlier than December 5, 2022, the Appellant did not return her election within the 60 days allotted to respond.  The notice letter was mailed to the Appellant on February 14, 2023; she mailed the response on May 30, 2023, which is 105 days after February 14, 2023.  

The Board finds the Appellant was adequately informed of the 60-day period, as this information appeared twice in the notice letter she received.  The Appellant was also informed of the election that would be made if she did not respond within the 60 days.  

Although the Veteran asserted that the 60-day period was missed due to dental and medical procedures, neither the Veteran nor the Appellant submitted evidence that they were unable to make the election within the 60-day period due to dental and medical procedures.  The Board further notes the Appellant chose Direct Review for this appeal; the Board would have been unable to review and consider any evidence of such procedures submitted after the date of the June 2023 administrative decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Lastly, the Board notes the VA regulation governing beginning dates specifies that the date of VA's decision that the veteran is permanently and totally disabled will be set as the beginning date if the child fails to choose a beginning date within the 60-day time period.  38 C.F.R. § 21.3041(i)(2).  The Board is bound by the laws and regulations governing VA education benefits, and is without legal authority to grant any extension to the time period in which to elect a beginning date.

Therefore, the beginning date for the Appellant's DEA benefits is December 5, 2022, the date of VA's rating decision finding the Veteran permanently and totally disabled.  As the beginning date is December 5, 2022, VA is unable to pay retroactive DEA benefits for the period the Appellant was in school from February 11, 2019, the date of eligibility, to when she completed her master's degree in in July 2020.  The appeal is denied.
