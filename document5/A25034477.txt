REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence, including as but-for due to service-connected disability of PTSD is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran appealed a March 2024 rating decision on Higher-Level Review (HLR) via the Direct Review Lane, and the appeal was duly docketed at the Board. See March 2024 Rating Decision Narrative; June 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2024 BVA Docketing Letter.

Entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence, including as but-for due to service-connected disability of PTSD, is remanded.

The Veteran has a diagnosis of urinary incontinence. The Veteran is service connected for PTSD (previously rated as anxiety to include major depression), IBS, asthma and left wrist sprain. The Veteran's records show that he served in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan. 

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained medical opinions wherein the clinicians opined that it is less than at least as likely as not that the Veteran's urinary incontinence is due to his service-connected PTSD or his TERA. See February 2024 C&P Exam, 1st Entry); September 2023 C&P Exam, 3rd Entry. Neither clinician, however, addressed the aggravation prong of secondary service connection, which renders the opinions inadequate. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023). 

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is... due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. "The statute, [38 U.S.C. § 1110], plainly requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability. This broad language applies to the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability. Stated another way, § 1110 provides for compensation for a worsening of functionality-whether through an inability to treat or a more direct, etiological cause. Nothing in the statute limits § 1110 to onset or etiological causes of a worsening in functionality" Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023). (emphasis added)

The reliance on an inadequate medical opinion is a pre-decisional error. Hence, a remand is required. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the claim file to either of the clinicians who provided the September 2023 and February 2024 nexus opinions, or another clinician with similar credentials if both are no longer available. 

(a.) Ask the clinician to provide an addendum wherein the clinician opines if the Veteran's PTSD is a but-for cause, to include whether it aggravates or worsens,  his diagnosed urinary incontinence?

?

(b.) Inform the clinicians that a full explanation for the opinion must be provided. 

2. After the above is complete, readjudicate the claim as appropriate.
