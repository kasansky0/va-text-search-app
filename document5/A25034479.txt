ORDER

The Veteran's appeal of attorney J.B.'s eligibility to the direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in a September 2023 rating decision granting entitlement an earlier effective date for the service connection of a right knee disorder, a temporary total right knee rating, and a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In January 2024 and February 2024 written correspondence received prior to the promulgation of a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision in this case, the Veteran withdrew his appeal of the October July 2024 Fee Decision finding attorney J.B. eligible to the direct payment of fees from past due benefits awarded in a September 2023 rating decision granting an earlier effective date for the service connection of a right knee disorder, a temporary total right knee rating, and a TDIU.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for the dismissal of the present appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1972 to July 1975; attorney J.B. was briefly his representative before the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  This matter comes before the Board on appeal of an October 2023 VA Fee Decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) regarding a September 2023 rating decision granting an earlier effective date for the service connection for a right knee disorder and a TDIU.  As this was an initial fee decision, the contested claims procedures of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) apply.

In this case, the Veteran, represented by the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) service organization, filed a September 2019 claim of entitlement to service connection for his right knee that was granted by the AOJ in a January 2020 rating decision, effective the date of the September 2019 claim.  With the aid of DAV, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 Board Appeal seeking an earlier effective date of January 2011.  While this appeal was pending before the Board, the Veteran submitted a valid August 2023 VA Form 21-22a appointing attorney J.B. as his representative before VA, as well as a duly signed fee agreement stipulating payment of 20 percent of past due benefits awarded.  

Prior to attorney J.B. contributing any argument or development to the case, the Board issued a September 2023 decision granting an earlier effective date of January 2011 for the service connection of a right knee disability, as well as a temporary total right knee rating and a TDIU from July 2017.  The AOJ issued a September 2023 rating decision implementing the Board grant, resulting in approximately $234,000 in past due benefits being awarded to the Veteran.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a new VA Form 21-22 reappointing DAV as his representative before VA.  The October 2023 Fee Decision on appeal found that attorney J.B. was eligible for the direct payment of fees amounting to 20 percent of the past due benefits awarded in the September 2023 rating decision. 

In his timely December 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran disputed the award of fees and stated that the "attorney said he was going to give me the money since he did nothing for the case."  Internal VA documents reveal almost $47,000 in fees were disbursed to attorney J.B. in December 2023.  However, in January 2024 written correspondence personally signed by the Veteran, he stated, "I am requesting to withdraw [the] appeal for attorney fee agreement.  I no longer wish to pursue this appeal."  Further, in February 2024 written correspondence the Veteran's DAV representative noted the Veteran's pending AMA case challenging attorney fees before the Board and argued that based on his January 2024 written correspondence withdrawing his appeal, the Board should dismiss the case.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Finally, in the case of a written withdrawal, an affirmative inquiry into whether the withdrawal was done with a full understanding of the consequences is not necessary.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2020).  As the Veteran has clearly and in writing expressed his desire to withdraw his appeal of the October 2023 Fee Decision, the Board finds that the criteria to dismiss the case have been met.
