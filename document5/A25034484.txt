ORDER

Service connection for migraines (hereinafter "headache disability") is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's headache disability had its onset in active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for a headache disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2007 to December 2007.

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  In that rating decision, the RO denied service connection for migraines.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307.  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.  In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the September 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim in full, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

Migraines 

The Veteran asserts her current headache disability is related to active-duty service.  See June 2024 Fully Developed Claim.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred inservice.  38 C.F.R. §3.303(d).

Lay assertions may serve to support a claim for service connection by establishing the occurrence of observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. ?38?C.F.R. §?3.159(a); Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994).  "Symptoms, not treatment, are the essence of any evidence of continuity of symptomatology."  See Savage v. Gober,?10?Vet. App.?488, 496?(1997) (citing Wilson v. Derwinski,?2?Vet. App.?16, 19?(1991)). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

A current diagnosis is not at issue.  In the September 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded a current diagnosis for migraine headaches.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104. 

The Veteran is competent to report the onset and persistent nature of her headache disability symptoms.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology that is not medical in nature); Charles v. Principi,16 Vet. App. 370, 374-75 (2002) (holding that particularly with respect to claims for tinnitus, a veteran is competent to present evidence of a diagnosis and continuous symptoms).

The Veteran's service treatment records show that at the time of her enlistment in May 2007, the Veteran did not suffer from any headaches.  In July 2007 the Veteran sought medical treatment on three different occasions for headaches.  On July 8, 2007, the Veteran experienced a headache so severe that she lost consciousness.  On July 29, 2007, the Veteran reported to the Emergency Room with complaints of headaches, specifically that she was experiencing three headaches per day.  A few days later, on July 31, 2007, her treatment records show a diagnosis of "headache syndromes."  See STR - Medical, December 2007.

The Board acknowledges the negative opinion of the June 2024 VA examiner.  However, the VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's service treatment records showing the diagnosis of headache syndromes, her ER visit, and the fact that her initial report of headaches included a loss of consciousness.  Therefore, the opinion is afforded little probative value.  See Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 179 (2005) (a VA examination must be based on an accurate factual premise).

Of greater probative value are the Veteran's service treatment records showing objective evidence of a headache disability diagnosed during active duty.  The Board, therefore, affords greater weight to the Veteran's credible statements and corroborating service treatment records.  

Accordingly, the most probative medical evidence of record suggests that the Veteran has a current headache disability that began during service.  The evidence is therefore at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's headache disability had its onset in service.  

As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for a headache disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§3.102, 3.303(d); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
