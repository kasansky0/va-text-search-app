ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted for the period from August 20, 2001 to September 18, 2014.

Entitlement to a TDIU for the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015 is dismissed as moot.

A TDIU is granted for the period since November 1, 2015.

Special monthly compensation (SMC) payable at the housebound rate pursuant to 38 U.S.C.§ 1114(s) is granted effective November 1, 2014.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. As of August 20, 2001, the Veteran's service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone has precluded her from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment.

2. Effective November 1, 2014, the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU based on a single disability and has additional service-connected disabilities independently rated as 60 percent or more disabling.

3. By virtue of this decision, the Veteran is awarded special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate for the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015, based on her concurrent receipt of a temporary total rating. Therefore, entitlement to TDIU for this period is moot. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. As of August 20, 2001, the criteria for entitlement to a TDIU based on PTSD alone are met, excluding the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400(o), 3.341, 4.3, 4.16, 4.19.

2. As of November 1, 2014, the criteria for SMC based on housebound status are met.  38 U.S.C. §§1114(s), 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. The appeal concerning entitlement to a TDIU from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015 is dismissed as moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1978 to December 1986.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a September 2020 supplemental statement of the case issued in the legacy appeals system that denied entitlement to a TDIU. The Veteran opted into the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system by filing a September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge. In adjudicating the claim, the Board may consider evidence associated with the record at the time the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the September 2020 supplemental statement of the case. If additional evidence was added to the record following the issuance of the September 2020 supplemental statement of the case, the Board did not consider it.

Historically, the TDIU at issue in this appeal stems from a May 2009 claim for an increased rating for a right knee disability.  See Phillips v. McDonough, No. 22-2575, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1178, at *17 (Vet. App. July 30, 2024) (observing that TDIU is not a separate claim when raised by Rice, but rather one way to get the appropriate rating for a disability). However, a TDIU claim stemming from an August 20, 2001 claim for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remained pending at the time the Board issued its December 2024 decision adjudicating entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). For efficiency reasons, the Board deferred adjudication of TDIU as it related to the underlying claim for service connection for PTSD in its December 2024 decision because a separate AMA appeal regarding entitlement to TDIU was pending before the Board, and the matter would be addressed in its entirety by the Board at a later date. This decision is the Board's full adjudication of the Veteran's claim for TDIU that has been continuously pursued since filing the August 2001 claim for service connection for PTSD.

TDIU

TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either: a) one disability that is rated at least 60 percent disabling, or b) two or more disabilities that amount to a combined disability rating of at least 70 percent and one of which is rated at least 40 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Here, a January 2025 rating decision implemented a December 2024 Board decision awarding an increased initial 70 percent rating for the Veteran's service connected PTSD, and assigned an effective date of August 20, 2001 for the grant of the increased rating. The Veteran's combined disability rating has been at least 80 percent since that date, such that the schedular requirements for a TDIU have been met throughout the entirety of the appeal period. The remaining question is whether the Veteran is unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment as a result of her service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§3.155, 3.340, 3.400(o)(2), 4.16(a); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1992); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 356 (2000). 

The evidence in this regard reflects that in April 2001, the Veteran reported that she had resigned from her job due to the stress and that resigning had helped to decrease her anxiety. A VA treatment note from that month indicated that the Veteran had been very stressed ruing the preceding few months and had undergone several job changes during the past year due to her anxiety.

In August 2001, the Veteran told a therapist that she had filed for disability because she did not feel she could manage her stress or regular employment. On August 20, 2001, the Veteran and her representative submitted a statement in support of her informal claim for service connection for a psychiatric condition, contending that the Veteran's symptoms were so debilitating that she had been "unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment." In a September 24, 2001 treatment record, a doctor of psychiatry noted that the severity and chronicity of [the] [psychiatric] condition [were] likely to erode continued efforts to be occupationally successful."

In October 2001, she stated that she did not feel that she could manage the stress of even a part-time job and in December 2001 she was granted entitlement to Social Security disability due to her mental health disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2002 where it was indicated that the Veteran was receiving Social Security disability benefits for generalized anxiety. Mental health progress and treatment notes throughout the claims period reflect that the Veteran has constantly struggled with episodes of depression, mood changes, interpersonal conflicts with others, and managing her stress and anxiety. Even though she has consistently been involved with Alcoholic Anonymous(AA), she repeatedly had difficulty dealing with others in the group and has occasionally felt that she was being "targeted." In August 2003, she reported harassing phone calls that she believed were coming from people from AA and in September 2003, she stated that she believed that a speaker at a recent AA conference was directing sarcastic remarks at her and that she had to leave the room.

In her December 2004 VA Form 8940, the Veteran reported that she was last employed in March 2001, and had a work history involving clerical support in an office setting, and work as a call agent.

In March 2005, the Veteran reported that she had resigned from her position at her old AA group and had become more involved in a different group. In August 2005, she stated that she had been having problems with a woman in her apartment complex who was stalking her who also attended the same AA meeting as her. In September 2005, she reported that she had become upset and angry when a male member of her group asked her out and that she now felt awkward when he was in the same meeting.

In May 2006 mental health treatment, the Veteran reported that she became very upset when she received a letter from Social Security checking on her employment status. She reported feeling anxious and tearful and believed that her disability payments were going to be terminated even though she still felt that she remained unable to tolerate the stress of working. She reported that she had spent a great deal of time crying in her apartment.

In July 2006, a VA examiner noted that the Veteran appeared fidgety and displayed angry, labile, irritable, anxious mood and effect. The examiner observed that the Veteran's thought processes appeared "fast, confused, easy distractibility, flight of ideas." The Veteran stated that she was doing well on her current medication but that she continued to be unable to work due to anxiety and her "inability to cope with stress." She indicated that there were still days in which she was unable to function.

In February 2008, the Veteran was hospitalized due to an escalation in her symptoms. She reported that she experienced increased depression, irritability, frequent crying spells, and anger. She reported having difficulty with her AA sponsor and had to give up on their relationship and she had attempted to regain her position with AA as a trustee but was told that she was no longer a good fit. She had become fearful of losing control and had come to VA for help. She denied thoughts of suicide but did admit to thoughts of worthlessness. During a post-discharge therapy appointment, the Veteran stated that she was doing better but was still ruminating on the past and that she felt sad and depressed and was easily angered. She also reported that she felt anxious and occasionally panicky.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in April 2009. The examiner observed that she appeared anxious and fearful and noted that the Veteran had difficulty maintaining employment since 2000, when she began working for her cousin but had to quit because a coworker was being sexually inappropriate with her. She stated that her mood was stable at the time of the examination and that she was doing better than she had in a long time, but still felt intense fear and occasionally became tremulous and tearful. The examiner noted that the Veteran was still extremely vulnerable and had to avoid stressful situations. She had consistently participated in treatment and had made significant progress, but her susceptibility to stress and tendency to experience interpersonal conflicts with others made it difficult for her to maintain gainful employment. 

In a December 2014 treatment note, the Veteran told her psychiatrist that she had started having flashbacks again during the hospitalization which were triggered by one of the nurses and that she was experiencing depression. A February 2016 treatment note reflected that the Veteran suffered from depressive symptoms, making daily functioning "somewhat difficult." In a March 2016 treatment note, the Veteran reported symptoms of depression and anxiety that made functioning very difficult. During a therapy session in May 2016, the Veteran reported that she missed working but was fearful that she would be unable to handle it due to past difficulty maintaining mental health while working which had resulted in homelessness in the past. In a September 2016 treatment note, the Veteran stated that her baseline level of anxiety averaged 70 out of 100. In a statement in the same month, she wrote that she avoided crowded and unfamiliar areas and that she had difficulty interacting with men and strangers. She stated that some days were good, and some days were horrible and that she was unable to work and sometimes could not think clearly. The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in September 2016 where the examiner opined that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication. The examiner noted that the Veteran lived alone and had not had any serious relationships since she and her fiancé broke up in 1993. The examiner furthered that the Veteran has friends that she made through AA. The Veteran reported a job history that reflected difficulty maintaining long-term employment due to difficulty working with others and especially around men and that she had not had gainful employment since March 2001, which she suffered a nervous breakdown. She reported that she continued to experience episodes of depression lasting for up to two weeks. The examiner noted that the Veteran had feelings of detachment from others, a persistent negative emotional state, irritable behavior and angry outbursts, as well as depression and anxiety.

Later clinical treatment records and reports of VA mental health documentation reflect functional impairment similar to the above.

Based on a review of the record and the above mentioned evidence, the Board finds that it was factually ascertainable that the Veteran could not secure and follow gainful employment since August 20, 2001by reason of her service-connected PTSD alone. Given the Veteran's level of education, her employment history, and her level of disability due to her service-connected PTSD, the Board finds that it was unlikely that the Veteran could have secured or followed a substantially gainful occupation consistent with her educational level and occupational experience. It is unlikely that the Veteran could have found a work environment that would allow her to work in isolation (and in particular, away from men) and miss multiple days due to her fatigue, anger, irritability, depression, impaired impulse control, and other psychological effects of her service-connected PTSD. Specifically, the Board finds that the symptoms described by the Veteran and noted by the VA examiners due to her service-connected PTSD rendered her unemployable. See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Accordingly, the Board finds that the competent evidence, when considered as a whole, is at least in equipoise with respect to the issue of whether the Veteran is unemployable due to the effects of her service-connected PTSD alone. Therefore, entitlement to a TDIU is granted, effective August 20, 2001, the date VA received her claim for service connection for PTSD.

In granting TDIU effective August 20, 2001, the Board also finds, however, that TDIU is moot for the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015, such that entitlement to TDIU during this period is dismissed. During this period, the Veteran is in receipt of a temporary total disability rating based on surgery requiring convalescence. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990). Thus, if VA has found a veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the rating schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate the Veteran totally disabled on any other basis. See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for a TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

However, a grant of a 100 percent disability does not always render the issue of a TDIU moot. VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits includes consideration of whether his disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). In this case, by virtue of this decision, the Veteran is in receipt of both a 100 percent disability rating and SMC payable at the (s) rate from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015; therefore, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015 is moot, and accordingly is dismissed.

Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate

As noted in the Findings of Fact above, the Veteran was awarded a temporary total disability rating based on surgery requiring convalescence for the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2015. The AOJ awarded SMC payable at the housebound rate as an ancillary benefit for the period from September 19, 2014 to November 1, 2014.

VA's duty to maximize a claimant's benefits requires consideration of whether his or her disabilities establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), SMC is payable where the veteran is either statutorily housebound or housebound in fact.

A veteran meets the statutory requirements for payment of SMC at the housebound rate when he or she has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent (or a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on a single disability) and has additional service-connected disabilities with a combined rating of 60 percent or higher. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 U.S.C. § 3.350(i); see also Bradley, supra (holding that a TDIU rating could qualify for compensation at the 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) rate, but only if the TDIU was based on a single disability). The disabilities that combine to 60 percent must be "separate and distinct" from the single disability independently ratable at 100 percent. 38 C.F.R. §3.350(i)(1).

Above, the Veteran was granted a TDIU based solely on her service-connected PTSD for the period from August 20, 2001 to September 18, 2014, and for the period since November 1, 2015. For SMC purposes, this disability satisfies the requirement of a "service-connected disability rated as total." See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008). The Veteran also has additional disability rated at 60 percent or higher as of November 1, 2014 (total right knee arthroplasty and scar residuals associated with a left wrist ganglion cyst). Thus, in light of the Court's decisions in Bradley and in Buie, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U. S.C. § 1114(s) is granted for the period since November 1, 2014.
