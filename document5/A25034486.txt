DOCKET NO. 210812-178338
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2024, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was informed by the appellant's representative that the appellant died in October 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the appellant, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant served on active duty for training from April 1969 to September 1969. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in August 2020 by a VA Regional Office.  In August 2021, the appellant timely appealed such rating decision by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II.

2. Entitlement to service connection for polycythemia vera.

3. Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a vision disorder with bilateral cataracts. 

Unfortunately, as noted previously, the appellant died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the appellant's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the appellant's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the appellant's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a). However, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution in the instant case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
