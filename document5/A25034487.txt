ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's April 6, 2024, VA Form 10182 was an improper concurrent election which sought to appeal a rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for OSA at the same time that higher-level review of the service connection claim for OSA remained pending.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1989 to November 1994.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO).  

Dismissal

By way of background, the Veteran filed a December 2023 Supplemental Claim seeking reconsideration of his previously denied claim for entitlement to service connection for OSA. In March 2024, the RO found new and relevant evidence had been received to reconsider the Veteran's claim however, entitlement to service connection for OSA was denied on the merits. The Veteran thereafter filed an April 1, 2024, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) of the March 2024 rating decision regarding his OSA claim.

While his HLR was still pending, the Veteran concurrently filed a Notice of Disagreement on April 6, 2024, attempting to appeal the same March 2024 rating decision, on the same basis.

Later that same month, in April 2024, the Board erroneously informed the Veteran that his appeal had been placed on the Direct Review Docket.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing a supplemental claim, Higher Level Review (HLR) request, or Board appeal. The Veteran, however, is prohibited from concurrently requesting multiple types of review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

As an aside, the Board acknowledges that the Court has held that a claimant may seek a second administrative review option with respect to the same decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). Even so, the Veteran may not seek both review options concurrently. Id. at 2. In other words, a second administrative review is permissible if it is timely, and it does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A).

In this case, a March 2024 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for OSA.  On April 1, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Review (HLR) request regarding the March 2024 rating decision. Later in April 2024, while the HLR request was still pending, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 attempting to appeal his previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for OSA, citing the March 2024 rating decision.

The Veteran did not and has not withdrawn the HLR request.  In fact, the RO issued a HLR rating decision in response to the Veteran's HLR request in July 2024. As such, the Board finds the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election and the docketing of the appeal was in error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see Terry, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

The Board has also considered the applicability of any waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election. See generally, Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc) (holding the one-year deadline to file a legacy NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims processing rule); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2022) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal). The Board still retains subject-matter jurisdiction over claims on appeal when claims-processing rules are not followed; it is the Board's duty to engage in factfinding and explain the basis for any waiver or forfeiture of the relevant claims-processing rules. Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333.

In particular, the Board considered whether it waived its right to enforce the prohibition on concurrent election by virtue of docketing the appeal. See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal[]" for over five years.").

The Board finds that assigning the appeal a docket in and of itself does not constitute a waiver of the prohibition of concurrent election. Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection to a concurrent election should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case. Accord Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).

Here, although the Board completed the ministerial action of docketing the appeal, unlike the circumstances in Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal. There were no further communications, no hearing held, no action in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way. Rather, the Veteran's service connection claim for OSA remained under development at the AOJ level at the time the Veteran filed the April 6, 2024, NOD, and the Veteran has been in receipt of communications in this regard. Indeed, the RO issued a HLR rating decision in July 2024 in response to his April 1, 2024, HLR request. Moreover, the time for filing a proper and timely appeal of the July 2024 HLR rating decision, maintaining any possible effective date, has not passed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been no waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election under the facts and circumstances of this case.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds the attempted appeal must be dismissed as the April 6, 2024, VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election, and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made. The Board reiterates its finding that the docketing of the instant appeal was in error.
