ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus began during service and has continued since that time.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1984 to March 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 higher-level review rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Additionally, the Board notes that in December 2023, VA received a VA Form 21-22 from the Veteran appointing attorney David Stevens as his representative. In February 2025 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-22 attempting to appoint the National Association for Black Veterans as his representative. However, this VA Form 21-22 was not signed by any representative of that VSO. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran continues to be represented by attorney David Stevens in this appeal.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his tinnitus began in service and has continued since that time. See April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Board agrees.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires evidence showing (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For chronic diseases listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including other organic diseases of the nervous system, service connection may alternatively be established with evidence of chronicity of the disease during service or during a presumptive period following service separation, or by showing a continuity of symptoms after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012). To establish chronicity of the disease during service, there must be evidence of a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic." 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). When chronicity or continuity of symptoms is shown, evidence of a medical nexus or causal link to service is not required to establish service connection. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1338-39; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Rather, the chronic disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service. Walker, 708 F.3d at 1136.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Regarding the first and second elements of service connection, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with tinnitus and was exposed to hazardous noise in service, and these findings are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. See June 2023 C&P Examination (diagnosis of tinnitus); July 2023 Military Personnel Record at 23 (MOS of Radioman's Mate); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Thus, this appeal turns on whether a nexus is shown, or may be presumed, linking the Veteran's service and his current disabilities.

There is conflicting evidence in this regard. In favor of the claim are the Veteran's lay statements. The Veteran has competently and credibly reported that his tinnitus began during service, while serving on a ship as a radioman, and has continued since that time. The Veteran has provided a range of dates for the onset of his tinnitus, from 1984 to 1987. See, e.g., June 2023 C&P Examination; October 2023 C&P Examination. The Board places great weight on the Veteran's credible lay statements that his tinnitus symptoms began during service and have continued to the present. The Board notes that because tinnitus is "subjective," its existence is generally determined by whether or not the claimant claims to experience it. For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's assertions of an in-service onset of tinnitus to be competent and credible, and his lay statements are of high probative value as to nexus.

Against the claim are the opinions of the June 2023, September 2023, and October 2023 VA examiners. The June 2023 and September 2023 VA examiners concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or the result of military noise exposure, noting that the Veteran did not have significant threshold shifts indicating auditory damage. The October 2023 VA examiner also concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure, noting what the examiner took to be inconsistencies in the report of onset of tinnitus, and post-service noise exposure.

The Board acknowledges the opinions of the June 2023, September 2023, and October 2023 VA examiners but finds that the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and duration of his tinnitus are credible and warrant greater probative weight than the opinions of the VA examiners in this context. The Veteran's lay statements have remained consistent regarding an onset in service generally, and are corroborated by the favorable findings by the AOJ of noise exposure due to his MOS. Although the October 2023 VA examiner found the Veteran's statements regarding the initial onset of tinnitus to be inconsistent because the identified onset date varied by a couple years, the Board would not expect someone to remember precisely the exact month or even year that tinnitus onset given that took place approximately 40 years ago and is the type of symptom that may have initially been ignored as anomalous or as something that would resolve on its own. In light of such statements and findings and resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the record is at least approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during service and has continued since that time.

Generally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's current tinnitus is caused by, or otherwise related to, his military service and the claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.
