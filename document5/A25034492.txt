ORDER

The reduction of the evaluation for pyelonephritis from 10 percent to a noncompensable evaluation, effective July 31, 2020, was proper; restoration of the 10 percent evaluation is therefore denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation from July 31, 2020, for service-connected pyelonephritis is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected left-hand tremors is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected right-hand tremors is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence shows material improvement of the Veteran's service-connected pyelonephritis, and the improvement is maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.

2. The Veteran's pyelonephritis manifests as a urinary tract infection that does not require long term drug therapy, one to two hospitalizations per year, and/or requiring intermittent intensive management; or recurrent symptomatic infection requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer.

3. The Veteran's left-hand tremors manifest as symptoms that most nearly approximate mild convulsive tics and do not demonstrate functional impairment or symptoms severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under any analogous diagnostic code.

4. The Veteran's right-hand tremors manifest as symptoms that most nearly approximate mild convulsive tics and do not demonstrate functional impairment or symptoms severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under any analogous diagnostic code.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for restoration of the 10 percent evaluation for pyelonephritis, effective July 31, 2020, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, 4.115b; Diagnostic Code (Code) 7504.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a compensable evaluation from July 31, 2020, for service-connected pyelonephritis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, 4.115b; Diagnostic Code (Code) 7504

3. The criteria for a compensable evaluation for service-connected left-hand tremors have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8199-8103.

4. The criteria for a compensable evaluation for service-connected right-hand tremors have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.7, 4.10, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8199-8103.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1998 to August 2002, and from May 2005 to April 2019.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of background, the Veteran was granted service connection for pyelonephritis in a June 2005 rating decision and awarded a 10 percent evaluation effective February 15, 2005.  In May 2020, she filed a VA Form 21-526EZ and sought entitlement to service connection for a neurological disorder, specifically "shaking or tremors of the hands and arms," and sought an increased evaluation for her service-connected pyelonephritis.

In a March 2021 rating decision, the RO granted entitlement to service connection for bilateral hand tremors and awarded a noncompensable evaluation effective May 7, 2020.  The RO reduced the Veteran's evaluation for her service-connected pyelonephritis to a noncompensable evaluation effective July 31, 2020.

In March 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the issue of an increased evaluation for the service-connected bilateral hand tremors and issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the March 2021 rating decision.  In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2021 rating decision and August 2021 supplemental claim decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 (pyelonephritis) decision and August 2021 (tremors) supplemental claim decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 (pyelonephritis) AOJ decision and August 2021 (tremors) supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.  When a claimant's disability is not specifically listed in the Rating Schedule, it is rated analogous to a disability in which the functions affected, as well as the anatomical localization and symptoms, are closely related.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  The analysis in the following decision is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

If the evidence for and against a claim is approximately balanced, the claim will be granted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  A claim will be denied only if the record persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

1. Whether the reduction for the evaluation for service-connected pyelonephritis from 10 percent to noncompensable was proper.

The Veteran is challenging the propriety of the rating reduction for her service-connected pyelonephritis from 10 percent disabling to noncompensable effective July 31, 2020.  See February 2022 VA Form 20-0996.

Special requirements exist where a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability or employability status would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). A rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e). The beneficiary must be notified at the last address of record of the action contemplated and furnished detailed reasons for the proposed decision. Id. Sixty days must be given for the presentation of new evidence to show that compensation should be continued at the present level. Id. 

When a rating has continued for five years or more, additional protections apply. Under such circumstances, a reduction may be accomplished when the evidence clearly warrants the conclusion that sustained improvement has been demonstrated, and when the rating agency determines that it is reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of the veteran's life. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a). Further, "[e]xaminations less full and complete than those on which payments were authorized or continued will not be used as a basis of reduction." Id. Where doubt remains, the rating agency will continue the rating in effect, and consider scheduling reexamination 18, 24, or 30 months later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (b).

In any rating reduction case, even those where the rating has been in effect for less than five years, "not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." Stern v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 51 (2021) (quoting Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993)).

The burden is on VA to establish that a rating reduction is warranted. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 421. VA rating reductions must be based upon review of the entire history of the veteran's disability. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Where a rating reduction was made without observance of law, the erroneous reduction must be vacated and the prior rating restored. Id. at 595.

Analysis

The Veteran was originally granted service connection for pyelonephritis in a June 2005 rating decision.  The RO awarded a 10 percent evaluation effective February 15, 2005.  See June 2005 Rating Decision - Narrative.  The RO did not obtain a VA examination, but found she was entitled to a 10 percent evaluation based on the Veteran's private treatment records showing she was hospitalized for pyelonephritis in June 2004.  See id.  The Veteran was in receipt of the 10 percent rating for more than five years. 

The Veteran filed for an increased evaluation for her service-connected pyelonephritis in a March 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The RO denied entitlement to an increased evaluation and continued her 10 percent rating in a March 2020 rating decision because the RO found the Veteran's records did not show a sustained improvement.  See March 13, 2020, Rating Decision - Narrative.  

The Veteran filed for an increased evaluation for her service-connected pyelonephritis in a May 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran did not provide reasoning for her claim for an increased evaluation.  See id.  The RO reduced her evaluation from 10 percent to noncompensable in a March 2021 rating decision.

Here, the reduction of the Veteran's evaluation for pyelonephritis from 10 percent to noncompensable did not affect the level of her combined disability evaluation; thus, the special requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) were not required.  See March 4, 2021 Rating Decision - Narrative.

Turning to the medical evidence, the Veteran attended a VA examination in January 2020 and was diagnosed with chronic pyelonephritis.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran was treated in the service for pyelonephritis with IV antibiotics, but that the Veteran still noted left flank pain.  The examiner found that the Veteran was not taking continuous medication for her pyelonephritis and she did not have renal dysfunction.  The VA examiner found the Veteran did not have a history of recurrent symptomatic urinary tract or kidney infections.  The Veteran's renal function at the time of the examination was normal.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's pyelonephritis would not affect her ability to work.  Finally, the examiner remarked that there was no change in the Veteran's diagnosis.

The Veteran attended a subsequent VA examination in July 2020, and she was diagnosed with chronic pyelonephritis.  At her examination, the Veteran reported that she has had recurrent dull pain in her left flank since her initial treatment for pyelonephritis in 2002.  She indicated that she has had recurrent episodes of pyelonephritis, namely six, from October 2002 to September 2019.  She explained to the VA examiner that her pain was provoked by dehydration, caffeine and alcohol, as well as bladder infections.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran was not taking continuous medication for the diagnosed condition.  The examiner found the Veteran did not have renal dysfunction.  The VA examiner noted a history of recurrent symptomatic urinary tract or kidney infections, indicated the etiology was chronic pyelonephritis, and noted the Veteran did not use treatment.  The Veteran's renal function at the time of the examination was normal.  The VA examiner found that the Veteran's condition had progressed to chronic, and noted four dates that indicated chronicity: June 5, 2004, August 18, 2005, February 13, 2014, and March 22, 2014.

The dates identified by the July 2020 VA examiner are during the Veteran's active service.  The Veteran's service treatment records reflect multiple complaints of left flank pain and treatment for urinary tract infections.

There are no post-service treatment records that reflect complaints or treatment for chronic pyelonephritis or a urinary tract infection.  Indeed, at her July 2020 examination, while the Veteran reported recurrent episodes of pyelonephritis, there are no corresponding treatment records corroborating this.  The Veteran reported she did not seek treatment for her recurrent pyelonephritis.  She also indicated that she had recurrent, dull pain in her left flank since the onset of her chronic pyelonephritis in 2002, but her post-service treatment records do not reflect complaints or treatment for left flank pain.  

The Board finds that the Veteran's reduction in rating for pyelonephritis was proper.  She was afforded two full VA examinations in January 2020 and July 2020, and the findings were consistent with the entirety of her treatment records.  She has not provided evidence or argument against the finding that her pyelonephritis has improved, nor is there any indication in the record that her improvement is expected to be temporary.  For these reasons, the Board finds the reduction in rating for pyelonephritis as proper.

2. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation from July 31, 2020, for service-connected pyelonephritis.

The Veteran contends entitlement to a higher evaluation for her service-connected pyelonephritis.  See May 2020 VA Form 21-256EZ.

The Veteran's condition is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, Diagnostic Code 7504, for chronic pyelonephritis. The regulation instructs to rate the condition as renal dysfunction or urinary tract infection, whichever is predominant.  Here, the Veteran's renal function is normal and she has not contended that her condition is more appropriately rated as renal dysfunction.  See January 2020 and July 2020 VA Examinations.  Furthermore, the Veteran's January 2020 and July 2020 VA examinations show the predominate disability as a urinary tract infection.  Accordingly, the Board will analyze the Veteran's claim for an increased evaluation for pyelonephritis under the criteria for a urinary tract infection, her predominate disability.

The criteria for rating a urinary tract infection are in 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. During the pendency of the appeal, the criteria for rating dysfunctions of the genitourinary system were amended effective November 14, 2021. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities; The Genitourinary Diseases and Conditions, 86 Fed. Reg. 54081 (Sep. 30, 2021) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.115a, 4.115b). When a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a Veteran's appeal, the version most favorable to the Veteran applies, absent congressional intent to the contrary. The amended rating criteria, if favorable to the claim, can be applied only for periods from the effective date of the regulatory change; however, the old regulations will be considered for the periods both before and after the change was made. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114; VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33422 (2000); Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Thus, the Veteran is entitled to application of the criteria that are most favorable to her claim, except that an award based on the amended regulations may not be made effective before the effective date of the change. Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria before November 14, 2021, and both the old and new rating criteria from November 14, 2021. The criteria that are more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

Prior to November 14, 2021, the criteria for rating urinary tract infections provided that a 10 percent rating when the disability requires long term drug therapy, one to two hospitalizations per year, and/or requiring intermittent intensive management. A maximum 30 percent rating is provided for poor renal function, recurrent symptomatic infection requiring drainage/frequent hospitalization (greater than two times per year), and/or requiring continuous intensive management.

The amended criteria, effective November 14, 2021, provides that recurrent symptomatic infection not requiring hospitalization but requiring suppressive drug therapy for less than 6 months is rated as noncompensable. Recurrent symptomatic infection requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer is rated as 10 percent disabling. Recurrent symptomatic infection requiring drainage by stent or nephrostomy tube; or requiring greater than 2 hospitalizations per year; or requiring continuous intensive management is rated as 30 percent disabling. When poor renal function is associated with the urinary tract infection, the condition is to be rated as renal dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

The appeal period before the Board stems from the Veteran's May 15, 2020, VA Form 21-526EZ, plus the one-year look-back period.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The Board incorporates herein the discussion of the Veteran's January 2020 and July 2020 VA examinations from the previous section.  

The Veteran's private treatment records do not reflect complaints or treatment for pyelonephritis, urinary tract infections, or renal dysfunction.

The evidence of record is persuasively against finding that a compensable rating from July 31, 2020, is warranted.  The medical evidence of record does not show urinary tract infections that requires long term drug therapy, one to two hospitalizations per year, and/or requiring intermittent intensive management; or Recurrent symptomatic infection requiring 1-2 hospitalizations per year or suppressive drug therapy lasting six months or longer.  Indeed, there is no evidence during the period on appeal of complaints of the Veteran's contended recurrent pyelonephritis, and the Veteran reported she had not sought treatment for her disability.  The Veteran has not been hospitalized for pyelonephritis since its onset in 2002 and was last treated for the disability in 2014.   She contends her most recent episode was in September 2019, but there is no corresponding medical evidence, and the Veteran indicated she did not seek treatment.  See July 2020 VA Examination. Accordingly, the Board finds that a compensable rating from July 31, 2020, for service-connected pyelonephritis is not warranted, and the claim for an increased evaluation is denied.

3. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected left-hand tremors.

4. Entitlement to a compensable evaluation for service-connected right-hand tremors.

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for her service-connected bilateral hand tremors.  See September 2022 Notice of Disagreement.

The Veteran's bilateral hand tremors are rated as noncompensable under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8199-8103.

Initially, the Board notes that hand tremors do not have a specific diagnostic code in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Under VA regulations, unlisted conditions must be rated by analogy to a diagnostic code that closely reflects the symptoms or functional effects of the condition. 38 C.F.R. § 4.20. The comparison must involve similar anatomical localization and symptomatology.

The Veteran's bilateral hand tremors are manifested by involuntary tremors in her hands. See June 2021 VA Examination.

In this case, the AOJ assigned an analogous rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124, Diagnostic Code 8103, for convulsive tic disorders.

Diagnostic Code 8103 provides a noncompensable rating for "mild" tics, a 10 percent rating for "moderate" tics, and a maximum 30 percent rating for "severe" tics.

The terms "mild," "moderate" and "severe" are not defined in Diagnostic Code 8103. Thus, to interpret these terms, the Board must rely on the ordinary, dictionary definitions of these terms. See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018). According to Merriam Webster's online dictionary, "mild" means "gentle in nature or behavior" or "not being or involving what is extreme," "moderate" means "tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension" or "limited in scope or effect," and "severe" means "very painful or harmful" or "of a great degree." See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ (last visited April 10, 2025).

The appeal period before the Board stems from the Veteran's March 11, 2021, supplemental claim, plus the one-year look-back period.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

In July 2020, the Veteran attended a Central Nervous System (CNS) and Neuromuscular Diseases VA examination.  She was diagnosed with a movement disorder, specifically a bilateral hand tremor due to post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and toxic exposure.  The Veteran's tremors did not require continuous medication.  On objective testing, the Veteran had normal strength in her elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, grip, and pinch.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have muscle weakness in her upper extremities due to the CNS condition.  The VA examiner found a functional impact and explained that the Veteran could perform minimal hand activities that required fine coordination and dexterity.  

The Veteran underwent a Central Nervous System (CNS) and Neuromuscular Diseases VA examination in June 2021.  She was diagnosed with a movement disorder, and the examiner noted TBI related hand and leg tremors.  The Veteran was not being treated for the condition, and she did not take continuous medications for control of the tremors.   On objective testing, the Veteran had normal muscle strength in her upper extremities.  She had normal strength in her elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, grip, and pinch.  The VA examiner found a functional impact and noted that the Veteran was unable to do any kind of meaningful work due to the tremors in her hand and legs.

In June 2021, the Veteran attended a review Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) VA examination.  She was diagnosed with TBI related tremors.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's motor activity was normal most of the time, but mildly slowed at times due to apraxia.  The VA examiner found a functional impact. 

The Veteran indicated she has not sought treatment for her bilateral hand tremors at her July 2020 and June 2021 VA examinations.  There are no private or VA treatment records during the period on appeal that show complaints or treatment for bilateral hand tremors.

The Veteran has not submitted a lay statement in support of her claim for an increased evaluation for her bilateral hand tremors.

The Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's bilateral hand tremors result in a functional impact sufficient to warrant a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 8103.  In this regard, although the July 2020 and June 2021 VA examiners found a functional impact, the Veteran's objective muscle strength testing was normal, to include grip and pinch, she had not sought treatment for the bilateral hand tremors, and she was not taking medication to control the tremors.  The Board finds that the disability picture is best approximated by mild severity, thus, a noncompensable rating is warranted.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claims for a compensable rating for her bilateral hand tremors are denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
