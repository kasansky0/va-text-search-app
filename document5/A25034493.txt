REMANDED

Entitlement to reimbursement of the cost of beneficiary travel for care provided on February 7, 2024, stiches removal after a surgery, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from January 1970 to May 1970.  See DD 214.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 administrative decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of reimbursement of beneficiary travel, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

 A favorable finding of the AOJ which the Board will not disturb is that the claim was timely filed.  See VHA Beneficiary Travel File, received on received on October 28, 2024, pg. 7.

In October 2024, the Board notified the Veteran of his right to switch dockets within 60 days of the receipt of the VA Form 10182, or within one year of the decision on appeal.  To date, the Board has not been notified by the Veteran, or his representative, of an intent to switch dockets.  In any event, both deadlines have now passed, and the Board proceeds to the merits of the claim.

1. Reimbursement of beneficiary travel on February 7, 2024. 

The Veteran contends that he should be reimbursed for the expenses related to travel to take out his stitches, which were from a surgery performed at a Mayo Clinic in Mankato, Minnesota.  See March 2024 VA Form 10182; see also October 2025 Informal Hearing Presentation Brief (IHP).

According to the record, the claim was denied because the appointment was not completed.  See VHA Beneficiary Travel File, pg. 7.  It also adds the following: "Since the appointment is more than 2 days in the past the claim needs to be looked at manually to determine if payment is due or whether the claim should be denied."  Id.  The Board finds that the reasoning or explanation of this denial does not appear to comply with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5104, as the reasoning appears equivocal, and appears incomplete.  

Generally, notice under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 must include the following: (1) identification of the issues adjudicated; (2) a summary of the evidence considered by the Secretary; (3) a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; (4) identification of findings favorable to the claimant; (5) in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; (6) an explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and (7) if applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

Thus, remand is required to provide an adequate notice of decision and to associate it with the claims file to satisfy a statutory duty under 38 U.S.C. § 5104.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) (the Board may remand to correct any error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty).  Furthermore, remand is needed to clarify the reasoning of the denial as the reasoning appears to contradict with the evidence; as it makes sense that his stitches were removed.  As the Board finds the current record indicates unclear reasoning in the denial, it does not appear to meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b).

The Board also finds remand is needed to obtain documents to determine if the Board has jurisdiction to address the claim.  The medical records associated with the care on appeal, have not been associated with the claim file.  Without these records, it is unclear whether the care was an authorized Community Care appointment.  It is also unclear whether the surgery was authorized in advance, or whether it was performed on an emergency basis. The VHA file indicates that the care was provided at a Mankato Clinic/Hospital.  See VHA File, pg. 5 (containing screenshot).  The VHA file in this case contains seven pages of VHA records, three of which are an internal checklist, one a screenshot indicating that the Veteran is eligible, and one a screenshot of the Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS), indicating the claim was timely entered by a Super User on March 14, 2024.  See id. at pgs. 1-5.  Thus, without the determination of the type of care, whether emergent or pre-authorized care in the Veterans Community Care, the Board cannot clearly determine whether it has jurisdiction in the matter.

While the Board has jurisdiction to address eligibility for payment for medical expenses in some instances, it does not have jurisdiction to determine eligibility for payment for referral to a community care network pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1703 or eligibility for payment under a Veterans Care Agreement (VCA).  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703 (f), 1703A; 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135.

The care on appeal was furnished on or after June 6, 2019.  As such, authorizations for non-emergent non-VA community care are provided through the Veterans Community Care Program (VCCP) or VCA.  Disputes under VCCP or a VCA, including for reimbursement or payment for related care, do not fall within the Board's jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 1703 (f); 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135 (c)(5).  Without associated claims or underlying medical record, the Board cannot confirm if it has jurisdiction to review whether the claims on appeal pertain to VCCP or VCA prior authorization of treatment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c).

The Board shall decide all questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).  Additionally, a decision of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record under applicable statute and regulation.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

Due to a record which is apparently incomplete, it is unclear under what authority the appellant seeks or may otherwise be entitled to payment.  While the Board has jurisdiction to address eligibility for payment for medical expenses in some instances, it does not have jurisdiction to determine eligibility for payment for related to a referral to a community care network pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1703 or eligibility for payment under a Veterans Care Agreement.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703(f), 1703A; 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135. 

Beneficiary travel, emergency care and VCCP care are reviewed under different statutes.  Furthermore, without the underlying medical records, or claim submissions, the Board cannot determine if the care was emergent. Thus, a duty to assist error may have occurred in development of the record before the Board.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that remand is warranted for the AOJ to associate with the claim file all claims for reimbursement, adjudicatory documents, and medical records considered in connection with the claims on appeal.  If such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.  If the AOJ is unable to provide private of VA records related to this appeal, the appellant must still be notified in writing of the decision affecting the payment of benefits, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5104.

The appellant is notified that under the modernized appeal system, remands do not automatically return to the Board for additional adjudication.  Should the AOJ deny the claim and the Veteran wish to continue his appeal before the Board, the Veteran should file a Notice of Disagreement within the applicable appeal period after the AOJ's readjudication of the claim.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all relevant filings, notices, adjudicatory documents, and evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.  The AOJ should document all efforts to obtain private medical records, as well all other evidence related to the appeal.  If such records are unavailable, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability, provide a copy to the Veteran, and associate a copy with the file.

2. The AOJ should include a finding whether the travel related to the care on appeal was under a Veteran's Care Agreement, VCCP, or emergent in nature.

3. The AOJ should issue a decision which contains a clear rationale as required by 38 U.S.C. 5104(b).
