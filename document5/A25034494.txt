ORDER

The appeal of the request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a respiratory disorder manifested by shortness of breath based on new and relevant evidence is dismissed.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In October 2023, the Veteran requested readjudication of the previously denied claim for service connection for a respiratory disorder manifested by shortness of breath.

2. An April 2024 rating decision was prepared for backfill purposes only and is not an adjudicative determination by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction.  

3. The Veteran's request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a respiratory disorder manifested by shortness of breath has not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in the first instance.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board does not have jurisdiction over the request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a respiratory disorder manifested by shortness of breath based on new and relevant evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4(a)(1), 20.104, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2017 to March 2021, including service in the Southwest Asia theatre of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  See October 2023 and February 2024 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memoranda (confirming the Veteran's service in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from March 2020 through April 2020 and his resultant participation in a TERA during his active military service).  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 administrative action by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

Procedurally, a February 2023 decision denied the Veteran's original March 2021 claim for service connection for "shortness of breath."  See February 2023 Rating Decision; March 2021 Veteran's Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21-526EZ) (stating that, when he "came back from the UAE, [he] experienced a very hard time breathing and losing [his] breath drastically").  

In October 2023, the Veteran again claimed entitlement to service connection for shortness of breath, maintaining that his condition was related to his in-service exposure to "JP8 fuel in burn pits and in everyday work conditions."  See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In response, the AOJ issued a letter to the Veteran acknowledging his claim but informing him that, because the claim for service connection for shortness of breath had been the subject of a prior denial, "VA regulations require you to file this request on the proper form."  See October 2023 VA Notification Letter.  The letter further informed him, among other things, that the AOJ would "take no further action until [it] received [his] completed form."  See id.  

?

Despite this, the AOJ continued to develop the Veteran's request for readjudication of the claim for service connection for shortness of breath.  In particular, a February 2024 rating decision reflects that adjudication of the issue of service connection for shortness of breath was deferred pending additional evidentiary development.  See February 2024 Rating Decision (noting that the "issue of compensation for shortness of breath is deferred for the following information: medical examination with opinion").  

The Veteran was subsequently afforded a VA respiratory conditions examination in March 2024, at which time he was diagnosed with Asthma that was "at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) caused by" the Veteran's "exposure(s) to particulate matter / burn pits" during his service in the Southwest Asia theatre of operations during the Persian Gulf War.  See March 2024 VA Respiratory Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); March 2024 VA Medical Opinion DBQ.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.320 (reflecting that, for veterans with qualifying service in the "Southwest Asia theater of operations" during the Persian Gulf War, service connection may be presumed for certain listed chronic diseases, including asthma, that are associated with exposure to fine, particulate matter, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of military service).  

In a letter dated April 1, 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) apologized for the delay in adjudicating the Veterans' claim and assured him that VA was "still processing [his] application for compensation" and that he would be "notified upon completion of processing."  See April 2024 VA Notification Letter.  

The following week, the AOJ associated a rating decision with the claims file that is blank except for the notation "Backfill Only."  See Rating Decision dated April 8, 2024.  See also VBMS Compensation and Pension Award dated April 8, 2024 (reflecting that the reason for preparation of the decision was for "Backfill rating only to remove the Deferred Issue in the Code Sheet (shortness of breath)").  An accompanying Codesheet lists "SHORTNESS OF BREATH [Environmental Hazard in Gulf War/Other Unidentified][Gulf War Presumptive 3.320/Particulate Matter]" among the conditions that are "Not Service Connected/Not Subject to Compensation."  See April 2024 Rating Decision Codesheet.  

Later that month, the Veteran called the AOJ to "report that he has not received a Notification/Decision Letter" regarding the deferred claim for service connection for shortness of breath.  See April 2024 Report of General Information (VA Form 27-0820) (requesting that the AOJ "[p]lease send the Veteran a decision letter letting him know what was decided so that he can move forward").  In June 2024, the Veteran again contacted the AOJ to request the status of his claim, and a report was generated noting that the claim for "[s]hortness of breath was not denied, it was deferred [in February 2024,] and the Veteran was not sent a notification regarding decision on claim."  See June 2024 VA Form 27-0820 (requesting that the AOJ "[p]lease review this information again and take action to open this claim, decide on it and notify the Veteran").  There is no indication that any action was taken in response to the Veteran's communications.  

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted an appeal to the Board challenging the AOJ's denial of entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by shortness of breath and listing the date of the decision being appealed as April 8, 2024.  See October 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).  In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See id.  See also 38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (reflecting that, under direct review, no development may be undertaken; the Board considers the same record as the RO in rendering a decision; and there is no evidence submission or a hearing request).  

Pursuant to claims processing rules as prescribed by VA regulation, the Board lacks the legal ability to decide appeals that have not already been adjudicated in a decision issued by the agency of original jurisdiction followed by a proper appeal of that decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4 (a)(1), 20.104(a), 20.201, 20.202.  The Board has the authority to determine whether it has appropriate jurisdiction over a claim, and it may dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have jurisdiction.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

Here, as noted, the April 2024 decision was prepared for "Backfill" purposes only, no adjudication of any claim occurred, and there is no accompanying notification letter.  See April 2024 Rating Decision; April 2024 VBMS Compensation and Pension Award.  In this regard, the Board notes that, as a general matter, backfill rating decisions do not, in and of themselves, constitute new or free-standing entitlement determinations; rather they are internal record-keeping mechanisms undertaken to enter prior decisional data that may not appear on the Codesheet or in the corporate database.

The purpose of the April 2024 "Backfill" decision was to "remove the Deferred Issue" of entitlement to service connection for shortness of breath from pending status.  See April 2024 VBMS Compensation and Pension Award.  However, as discussed, after issuing the letter purportedly declining to accept the Veteran's October 2023 application for compensation as a request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for shortness of breath, the AOJ led the Veteran to believe that his claim had, in fact, been accepted when it continued development actions, addressing the issue in the February 2024 rating decision and affording the Veteran a VA respiratory examination and etiological opinion in March 2024.  See February 2024 Rating Decision; March 2024 VA Respiratory Conditions DBQ.  Cf. Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 43 (2009) (indicating that VA waives objection to timeliness of an appeal by taking actions that lead the Veteran to believe than an issue is properly in appellate status).  Nevertheless, the AOJ has not yet issued an initial decision adjudicating the Veteran's October 2023 request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a disability manifested by shortness of breath.  

As there have not been any initial decisions issued by the AOJ, there was not yet a question of law or fact to be appealed at the time the Veteran filed his October 2024 VA Form 10182.  Under the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) is defined "an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result."  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(d).  To this end, the NOD must "identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees."  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a).  Thus, "before a claimant may file a NOD, there must be some 'adjudicative determination' to contest."  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461-62 (2011).  In short, the Board lacks the legal authority to decide appeals that have not been adjudicated in a decision issued by the AOJ followed by a proper appeal of that decision.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.4(a)(1).  

As such, because the April 2024 action was not an adjudicative decision from which a NOD could be filed, there is no justiciable issue before the Board and the appeal for service connection for a disability manifested by shortness of breath is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his service and regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.  In this regard, the Board notes that, as discussed above, after issuing the October 2023 letter informing the Veteran that he submitted his claim on the wrong form, the AOJ ordered additional development, which suggests that it did, in fact, accept the Veteran's request for readjudication of the claim for service connection for shortness of breath.  If the Veteran believes that his October 4, 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ remains pending and unadjudicated based on the AOJ's implicit acceptance of the request to readjudicate the claim for service connection for shortness of breath by continuing development of the issue, he should continue his efforts to inform the AOJ that his claim remains pending.  See Reports of General Information (VA Forms 27-0820) dated April 25, 2024, and June 14, 2024 (reflecting the Veteran's repeated attempts to notify the AOJ that the October 2023 claim for service connection for shortness of breath had not been decided).  See also DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52, 56 (2006) (holding that the proper procedure for a claimant to pursue "a claim believed to be unadjudicated (and for which there is no final decision that arguably failed to consider the claim) is to pursue a resolution of the original claim, e.g., seek issuance of a final [AOJ] decision with proper notification of appellate rights and initiate" a Notice of Disagreement).  

The Veteran may also follow the procedure detailed in the AOJ's October 17, 2023, letter by filing a Supplemental Claim on a VA Form 20-0995, along with new and relevant evidence, such as the March 2024 VA respiratory conditions examination report and opinion diagnosing asthma and relating it to the Veteran's in-service exposure events.  Any resulting AOJ determination, including any determination as to the appropriate effective date of the award if service connection for a respiratory disorder is ultimately granted, may be challenged when a decision is issued.  See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 254 (2007) (reflecting that, "[i]f a veteran believes that he has a pending claim for a benefit that has not received an initial decision, the veteran can unambiguously inform [the AOJ] that a particular benefit is being sought," and the AOJ "must then decide entitlement to the benefit and, if relevant, address the issue of when the claim was first raised"; only then, after a decision has been made by the AOJ in the first instance, can the veteran "argue that an earlier claim for the benefits should be considered part of the same claim stream that eventually resulted in the award of benefits for the purpose of establishing the effective date").
