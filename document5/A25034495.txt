DOCKET NO. 240805-461642
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The claim for entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) has been withdrawn and is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In correspondence dated September 30, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision by the Board, the Veteran requested that the appeal of entitlement to TDIU be withdrawn.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7105(d), 7108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204(b)(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2007 to September 2010.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

However, in September 2024, the Veteran submitted a written request to withdraw the appeal of entitlement to TDIU.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal before the Board issues a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or his or her authorized representative and is effective when received. Id.  

A withdrawal must include (1) the name of the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).

The Board finds that the written withdrawal complies with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
