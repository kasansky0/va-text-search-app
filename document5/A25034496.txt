ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease (DDD) is dismissed.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2014, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 60 percent for actinic keratosis (AK) of the forearms and hands, prior to December 2, 2019, is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2015, for the assignment of an increased rating for AK of the forearms and hands is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2015, for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2015, for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

A November 2021 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision implemented a November 2021 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision awarding a 40 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD for the period from May 8, 2014, to May 7, 2015, and denying a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine DDD for the period beginning May 8, 2015.  Such a rating decision is purely ministerial and, accordingly, cannot be appealed to the Board.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine DDD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 8, 2014, for the assignment of a 40 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1975 to March 1995.  These matters come before the Board on appeal from a November 2022 higher level review (HLR) decision by a VA AOJ.

A recitation of the complicated procedural history is required. This case originated with a claim dated May 8, 2015, in the Legacy appeals system; in pertinent part, the filing included claims for increased ratings for low back and AK. A February 2016 Legacy rating decision denied an increased rating for the lumbar spine, and granted an increased 10 percent rating for AK from May 8, 2015.

The Veteran appealed to the Board, which in a March 2019 decision denied an increased rating for the lumbar spine prior to August 12, 2015, and remanded the issues of lumbar spine evaluation since August 12, 2015, evaluation of AK, and entitlement to TDIU as part and parcel of the increased rating claims. 

In December 2019, on the basis of a Joint Motion for Partial Remand, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), vacated the Board's denial of increased rating for the lumbar spine prior to August 18, 2015.   

In connection with the issues remanded by the Board in March 2019, the AOJ in July 2020 granted increased evaluations for AK of 30 percent from May 8, 2015, and of 60 percent from December 2, 2019. A contemporaneous supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) continued denials of increased rating for the lumbar spine and entitlement to TDIU. These matters all remained in the Legacy system at that time. 

The Board issued a November 2020 Legacy decision denying an evaluation in excess of 60 percent for AK since December 2, 2019, and granting TDIU.  Evaluation of AK prior to December 2, 2019, and evaluation of the lumbar spine (before and after August 2015) were remanded.  The AOJ implemented the grant of TDIU that same month, effective December 2, 2019.

After development, the AOJ in a May 2021 Legacy rating decision granted an increased 40 percent evaluation for the lumbar spine, effective April 23, 2021. An SSOC addressing the low back was issued the same day.

An August 2021 Legacy rating decision (with a September 2021 notification letter) then awarded a 60 percent evaluation for AK and a 40 percent evaluation for the lumbar spine, both from May 8, 2015. TDIU and DEA were also awarded from that date.  A contemporaneous August 2021 under the Legacy system addressed only the lumbar spine DDD.  The other issues were not included in the SSOC.

In a November 2021 Legacy decision, the Board granted an increased 40 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD from May 8, 2014, to May 7, 2015, and denied a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine DDD for the period beginning May 8, 2015.  A November 2021 rating decision implemented that Board decision (with a December 2021 notification letter). 

The Veteran submitted a September 2022 VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR)) requesting review of the August 2021 and November 2021 rating decisions.  In November 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal.

Although the issues relating to AK of the forearms and hands, TDIU, and DEA benefits should have been included in the SSOC and returned to the Board under the Legacy system, the Board has construed the August 2021 rating decision as part of the SSOC and the September 2022 HLR request as a timely opt-in to the current Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(c).  The AOJ waived any objection to the opt-in by adjudicating the case and issuing the November 2022 HLR decision.  Thus, all of the issues are before the Board under the purview of the AMA.

Dismissal

In his VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested a higher rating and earlier effective date for his lumbar spine DDD.

In Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023), the Court outlined how the Board should address appeals of rating decisions that implement Board decisions.  According to the Court, 38 U.S.C. § 7104 "provides that the Board's jurisdiction is wholly derivative of the Secretary's"; "establishes that [a]ll questions in a matter under section 511(a) . . . shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary"; and indicates that "[f]inal decisions on such appeals shall be made by the Board."  Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations and emphasis in original).  A Board decision is deemed the Secretary's "final and conclusive" determination for any discrete issue decided in that decision.  Id.  (internal quotation marks omitted).

With these statutory provisions in mind, the Court found that a "pure implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision 'affect[ing] the provision of benefits' under section 511(a)." Id. (alterations in original).  In other words, such decisions are not appealable to the Board because the Board already rendered the Secretary's final determination on the issue in question.  Id.  The Court referred to the implementation of such rating decisions as "purely ministerial" in nature.  Id.

Applying the holding in Encarnacion to this case, the Board concludes that the November 2021 rating decision was a purely ministerial implementation of the November 2021 Board decision.  Specifically, the November 2021 rating decision awarded a 40 percent rating for lumbar spine DDD for the period from May 8, 2014, to May 7, 2015, and denied a rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine DDD for the period beginning May 8, 2015.  The AOJ did not render any findings on the issues already determined by the Board.  See Donovan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 404, 409 (1997).

Thus, because the Veteran sought appellate review of the AOJ's purely ministerial decision implementing the November 2021 Board decision, the Board must dismiss the Veteran's appeals for a lumbar spine DDD increased rating and earlier effective date.

As a final matter, the Board notes that the VA Form 10812 is not a motion for reconsideration.  Such a motion has specific requirements which are not met by the VA Form 10182.  For example, it does not include the date of the Board decision to be reconsidered or set forth clearly and specifically the alleged errors of fact or law in that Board decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002.  Thus, the Board has not considered the VA Form 10182 as a motion for reconsideration.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Remand is permitted to correct a pre-decisional error o.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  In this case, remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error by obtaining private treatment records that have been scanned into the VA medical center records system.  

VA medical center (VAMC) records indicate not only that the Veteran received non-VA dermatology treatment but also that records from that treatment were uploaded into the VA system.  This includes records listed on November 21, 2017, from "Northwestern Mi Dermatology" and December 13, 2018, from St. Joseph Mercy Hospital.  Although the December 2018 VAMC record did not specifically list this as a dermatology record, a skin pathology report with the same date from the same hospital is associated with the claims file.

Unfortunately, these images are not accessible in the claims file and the private treatment records currently associated with the claims file do not correspond to the referenced dates.  Thus, these treatment records must be associated with the claims file on remand.

The questions of earlier effective date of increase for AK (based on application of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), as well as the effective date of TDIU and DEA entitlement, are all inextricably intertwined with the above development, and must be deferred.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Complete the proper development to obtain records for treatment from "Northwestern Mi Dermatology" and St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, including the records noted on November 21, 2017, and December 13, 2018.  Any VISTA imaging related to such care must be produced.  All efforts must be documented, and unavailability of records certified as appropriate.
