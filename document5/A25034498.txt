FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The record reflects that the Veteran's claims for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and a skin disorder were denied in April 2018 and August 2019 rating decisions. The Veteran was notified of that decision and did not perfect an appeal within a year of the issuance of those decisions. 

2. The Veteran's notification of his intent to file claims for service connection for a low back disability, an acquired psychiatric disability, and a skin disability was received August 7, 2023, and followed by a formal claim for those benefits.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability have not been met. ?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include PTSD, have not been met. ?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for a skin disorder have not been met. ?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2005 to July 2011.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for increase for his skin disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for a low back disability

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for PTSD

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 7, 2023, for entitlement to service connection for epididymitis

The effective date for the award of service connection for a disease or injury is the day following separation from active duty, or the date entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. The effective date of an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400.? 

The Veteran filed an initial claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, characterized as PTSD, and for a skin condition, in January 2018. The latter claim was denied in an April 2018 rating decision, the former in an August 2019 rating decision. With respect to both decisions, the Veteran was notified of the decision and did not perfect an appeal within a year of the decision's issuance. As such, those decisions became final.

On August 7, 2023, VA received notification of the Veteran's intent to file a new claim for service connection for a low back disability, as well as claims to reopen the previously denied service connection claims for PTSD and a skin condition. There is no document in the record between the time the aforementioned final decisions were issued and August 7, 2023, that can be reasonably construed as a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, a skin condition, or a low back condition. As such, the Board regards August 7, 2023, as the date of claim in this case.

Accordingly, even assuming entitlement to the benefits sought arose prior to August 7, 2023, as the later of the two relevant dates, (date of entitlement and date of claim,) it represents the earliest available date for the awards of service connection. The Board sympathizes with the Veteran's sincere belief that he is entitled to these benefits from earlier dates, but application of effective dates in cases such as this is mechanical, and the Board is not at liberty to grant equitable relief. 

In sum, August 7, 2023, is the date of claim in this case and thus the earliest available effective date, and on that basis, the appeal for earlier effective dates must be denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. IR epididymitis is remanded.

Under the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the AOJ to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. §5103A, if the error occurred prior to the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. §5103A?(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. §20.802?(a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other AOJ error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. §20.802?(a).

The Veteran is service-connected for epididymitis and is in receipt of a noncompensable rating for that condition. The VA examiner with whom he met in April 2018 listed only eczema as an active skin-related diagnosis. The record, however, indicates the Veteran may be beset by additional skin-related diagnoses and associated sequelae, to include a systemic condition or conditions, and on that basis the Board finds remand warranted to afford it a complete picture of the Veteran's skin disability or disabilities and related symptomatology.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with a qualified clinician to explore the current nature and manifestations of his service-connected skin disability or disabilities. The entire claims file should be reviewed prior to the examination.

The examiner is directed to relate all current skin-related symptomatology in accordance with VA rating criteria.
