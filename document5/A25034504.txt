ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

During the pendency of the present appeal, a Board decision, dated October 28, 2024, and a rating decision, dated January 13, 2025, awarded service connection for COPD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for COPD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February 1978 to February 1981 with additional service in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2024 rating decision.

Preliminarily, in a March 2025 motion, the Veteran's representative submitted a statement indicating his intent to withdraw as the Veteran's authorized representative. Proper withdrawal of representation is guided by 38?C.F.R. §?20.6. Specifically, after an appeal to the Board has been filed, a representative may not withdraw services as representative in the appeal unless good cause is shown on motion filed consistent with specific procedural requirements. 38?C.F.R. §?20.6(a). The Board finds that good cause has been shown and that the procedural requirements of withdrawal of service by a representative are met. Accordingly, the representative's motion is granted. 

The Veteran filed a claim for service connection for COPD secondary to PTSD in December 2017. In a May 2023 decision, the Board denied service connection for COPD and awarded an effective date of January 31, 2017, for the grant of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU). The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) subsequently implemented the Board's decision in a May 2023 rating decision. The Veteran appealed the issue of service connection for COPD to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and, in a June 2024 Memorandum Decision, the Court vacated the Board's decision denying service connection for COPD and remanded it back to the Board for readjudication. 

Meanwhile, in May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, seeking review of the denial of entitlement to service connection for COPD, citing to the May 2023 rating decision. In August 2023, the AOJ issued a decision finding that the Veteran's claim remained denied because the evidence submitted with his Supplemental Claim was not new and relevant. In August 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the August 2023 denial of service connection for COPD.

In an October 2024 decision, the Board granted service connection for COPD secondary to PTSD. The Board found that the legal requirements of secondary service connection were met: the Veteran's service-connected PTSD caused him to use tobacco products after service, that tobacco use was a substantial factor in the development of his COPD, and that COPD would not have occurred but for the use of tobacco products. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. The AOJ implemented the Board's decision in a January 2025 rating decision, awarding service connection for COPD with an evaluation of 60 percent effective December 6, 2017, the date of the Veteran's claim, and an evaluation of 100 percent effective January 5, 2024.

The instant case arises out of the May 2023 Supplemental Claim. Though it created a separate, second appeal stream, the issues it contemplates are not "separate and distinct" from the original claim stream. See Johnson v. Collins, No. 23-7589, slip op. at *10 (U.S. App. Vet. Claims Mar. 26, 2025). Nor does this case involve any liberalizing law relevant to the Veteran's claim where a new basis of entitlement became available during the pendency of the claim. See id. at *8-10. The issues from the instant appeal are entirely subsumed in the original claim stream, which is no longer pending adjudication.

Furthermore, it was a decision of the Board that granted the Veteran service connection for COPD. Though the AOJ subsequently implemented the decision, it was not the action of a lower adjudicative body that resolved the issue currently on appeal-rather, it was the Board itself. See Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 214, 221 (2016) ("The decision of the lower adjudicative body, the [AOJ], cannot finally decide an issue already on appeal to the Board, the higher administrative appellate body."); Johnson, No. 23-7589, at *6-8. 

Finally, in implementing the decision of the Board, the AOJ awarded service connection effective December 6, 2017-the date of the Veteran's original claim. In the instant VA Form 10182, the Veteran does not seek an earlier effective date, nor will the Board infer such a claim. See Warren, 28 Vet. App. at 221; Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that downstream elements, such as the initial rating and effective date, are not part of an appeal of denial of service connection). 

Thus, there is no issue currently before the Board that has not already been addressed by the October 2024 Board decision. See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 204 (2021). The Board finds that during the pendency of this appeal, the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for COPD was granted in an October 2024 Board decision and implemented in a subsequent January 2025 rating decision. Thus, there remains no identified, specific determination in which the claimant disagrees on appeal. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d). Accordingly, the appeal before the Board is dismissed as moot. See Ramsey v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 223, 224 (2006) ("When the relief sought by a petition has been accomplished, the appropriate course of action is . . . to dismiss the matter as moot.").
