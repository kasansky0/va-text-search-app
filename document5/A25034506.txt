FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The functional impairment resulting from the Veteran's service-connected PTSD has at least as likely as not approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to symptoms to include obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; suicidal ideation; and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, since the effective date of service connection for the disability on November 17, 2017, but the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has experienced total occupational and social impairment, or a level of disability approximating such impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name; or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, due to his service-connected PTSD at any point in the applicable rating period.

2. The limitation of motion of the thoracolumbar spine noted on an examination in September 2020 has at least as likely as not been present throughout the applicable rating period based on the Veteran's November 2017 increased rating claim for his service-connected displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy, but the evidence fails to establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the date of this claim.

3. The Veteran has at least as likely as not experienced moderate incomplete paralysis of the left lower extremity femoral nerve from his November 2017 date of claim, but the evidence fails to establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the date of this claim.

4. The Veteran has at least as likely as not experienced moderate incomplete paralysis of the left lower extremity sciatic nerve from his November 2017 date of claim, but the evidence fails to establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the date of this claim.

5. The Veteran has at least as likely as not experienced moderate incomplete paralysis of the right lower extremity femoral nerve from November 2017 date of claim, but the evidence fails to establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the date of this claim.

6. The moderate instability of the right knee noted on examination in September 2020 examination has at least as likely as not been present throughout the applicable rating period based on the Veteran's November 2017 increased rating claim for his service-connected right knee disability, but the evidence fails to establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the date of this claim.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1991 to August 1994 and from April 2001 to December 2004.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement (VA Form 10182) regarding the September 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  The Board notes the Veteran's March 2024 notice of disagreement was timely filed with respect to the September 2022 rating decision, although being received more than one year after the date of the decision, because the record establishes the Veteran was not sent notice of the September 2022 decision until March 3, 2023.  As a result, the Board will proceed with appellate review of the six specific areas of disagreement encompassed by the September 2022 and March 2023 rating decisions in the context of the present appeal, as identified in the March 2024 notice of disagreement.  These issues include 1.) entitlement to a higher 70 percent initial rating for PTSD; 2.) entitlement to an effective date prior to September 21, 2020, for the increased 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy with an explicit request for a November 17, 2017, effective date; 3.) entitlement to an effective date prior to September 21, 2020, for the increased 20 percent rating assigned for left femoral radiculopathy with an explicit request for a November 17, 2017, effective date; 4.) entitlement to an effective date prior to September 21, 2020, for the increased 20 percent rating assigned for left sciatic radiculopathy with an explicit request for a November 17, 2017, effective date; 5.) entitlement to an effective date prior to September 21, 2020, for the 20 percent rating assigned for right femoral radiculopathy with an explicit request for a November 17, 2017, effective date; and 6.) entitlement to an effective date prior to September 21, 2020, for the 20 percent rating assigned for right knee instability with an explicit request for a November 17, 2017, effective date.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

In accordance with the provisions of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board's review in this case is limited to evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in respective decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was associated with the claims file after the evidentiary record for the appeal closed, the Board has not considered it at this time.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  For clarity, the Board will establish the parameters of the evidentiary record in the context of the individual issues below since the Veteran pursued numerous review options prior to the issuance of the decisions on appeal.  The Veteran is advised of the supplemental claim option if he desires consideration of any evidence not encompassed by the evidentiary record as defined in the following subsections discussing the individual issues.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

1. Entitlement to a 70 percent initial rating, but no higher, for PTSD, effective November 17, 2017, is granted.

The Veteran's service-connected PTSD is rated as 50 percent disabling from the effective date of service connection for the disability on November 17, 2017.  The Veteran's March 2024 notice of disagreement asserts a 70 percent initial rating is warranted for PTSD from November 17, 2017.

By way of history, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for PTSD on November 27, 2017, with an intent to file ten days prior.  A February 2018 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD with an initial 30 percent rating, effective November 17, 2017.  The Veteran filed a legacy notice of disagreement regarding his initial PTSD rating in October 2018 with the issue being addressed in a subsequent October 2020 statement of the case (SOC).  Following the issuance of the October 2020 SOC, the Veteran opted into the AMA's modernized review system by filing a higher-level review request in November 2020 regarding his initial PTSD rating; the AOJ issued a higher-level review decision later that month continuing the 30 percent initial rating assigned for PTSD, after which the Veteran filed a supplemental claim.  A March 2022 rating decision adjudicated the Veteran's November 2020 supplemental claim regarding his initial PTSD rating, awarding an increased 50 percent rating, effective November 27, 2021, based on an examination conducted on that date.  In March 2023, the Veteran filed another higher-level review request that resulted in the March 2023 rating decision on appeal, which awarded an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 50 percent rating assigned for PTSD.  The Veteran requested direct review of this decision by a VLJ, asserting a 70 percent rating is warranted for PTSD from November 17, 2017.  This procedural history establishes the Veteran continuously pursued a higher initial rating for PTSD via the review options afforded to him under the AMA after opting into the modernized review system after the issuance of the October 2020 SOC regarding his initial legacy appeal regarding the initial rating assigned for PTSD.  The Board also notes the evidentiary record for the current appeal closed with the March 2022 rating decision that adjudicated the Veteran's November 2020 supplemental claim; thereafter, the Veteran filed a higher-level review request, which, again, result in the March 2023 rating decision on appeal but was based on the evidentiary record at the time of the prior March 2022 rating decision.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Disabilities must be viewed in relation to their entire history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. VA is required to interpret reports of examination in light of the whole recorded history, reconciling the various reports into a consistent picture so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  VA is also required to evaluate functional impairment on the basis of lack of usefulness and the effects of the disabilities upon the claimant's ordinary activity.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Where service connection has been granted and the assignment of an initial evaluation is disputed, separate evaluations may be assigned for different periods of time based on the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

When there is a question as to which of two ratings apply, VA will assign the higher of the two where the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

As previously noted, a 50 percent initial rating is currently assigned for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.  PTSD is rated under Diagnostic Code 9411 in accordance with the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 70 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationship.  Id.

A 100 percent disability rating is reserved for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation to assign, the Board's primary consideration is the claimant's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the claimant's occupational and social impairment.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  Because the use of the term "such as" in the rating criteria demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, the Board need not find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms to award a specific rating.  Id. at 442; see also Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Nevertheless, all ratings in the General Rating Formula are associated with objectively observable symptomatology and the plain language of the regulation makes it clear that the claimant's impairment must be "due to" those symptoms; therefore, a claimant may only qualify for a given disability rating by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration.  Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 118; Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442.

Based on a review of the record, the Board finds an initial 70 percent rating for PTSD is warranted as asserted on appeal.  The Veteran has exhibited symptoms specifically contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria, to include obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; suicidal ideation; and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, throughout the applicable rating period.  The main issue in dispute is whether the lower threshold of occupational and social impairment noted by examiners is supported by the record despite the Veteran's reported symptoms.  The Board notes the Veteran is socially isolated and does not have any close acquaintances, was recently divorced due in part to his PTSD symptomatology, and frequently experiences issues at work due to anger and poor impulse control.  When this level of occupational and social impairment is considered in the context of the Veteran's reported symptoms, the disability picture more nearly approximates the 70 percent criteria under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders when compared with the currently assigned 50 percent rating.  In this scenario, the Board must assign the higher rating in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Accordingly, a 70 percent initial rating for PTSD, effective November 17, 2017, is warranted.

The Veteran has not asserted a 100 percent schedular rating is warranted in his case rather requesting the assignment of a 70 percent rating from his date of claim.  Indeed, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has experienced total occupational and social impairment, or a level of disability approximating such impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name; or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, due to his service-connected PTSD at any point in the applicable rating period.  connected PTSD.  The Board initially notes the Veteran has not been reported to have experienced any of the symptoms listed in the 100 percent rating criteria under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration, at any point despite numerous examinations since the submission of his initial service connection claim, which are generally consistent with his lay reports and documented treatment history.  Further, examiners have consistently assessed the Veteran's level of functional impairment at the 50 percent threshold, or below, under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  It is only when reasonable doubt is resolved in his favor that he meets the 70 percent threshold.  Although the Veteran divorced during the applicable rating period and has little to no friends, he interacts with his children on a routine basis, to include social outings, and works - albeit in a position that has limited interaction with the general public and/or other coworkers due to his anger management issues.  This disability picture is not consistent with the 100 percent rating criteria under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  Thus, a 100 percent rating for PTSD is not warranted.

Further, although the Veteran filed a formal application for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) in April 2013, the issue of entitlement to TDIU has not been raised during the rating period based on the Veteran's November 2017 claim since he has been gainfully employed during the applicable rating period and has not otherwise raised the issue of entitlement to TDIU since a November 2013 rating decision denied his April 2013 TDIU claim.

The Board also recognizes the written argument submitted with the Veteran's March 2024 notice of disagreement appears to raise the issue of service connection for major depressive disorder; however, this condition is noted to be unrelated to his service-connected PTSD and rather stems from pain and physical limitation.  As a result, the Board will not address secondary service connection for major depressive disorder in the context of the Veteran's PTSD rating appeal because a secondary service connection claim with PTSD serving as the primary disability has not been reasonably raised by the record and is not otherwise encompassed by the effective date appeals that will be discussed in the following subsections of this decision.  See Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203 (2021).  Yet, the Veteran should be assured that reasonable doubt has been resolved in his favor with all his psychiatric symptomatology being attributed to his currently service-connected PTSD.  See Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998).

In sum, the Board finds a 70 percent initial rating for PTSD, effective November 17, 2017, is warranted, as asserted on appeal; however, neither a 100 percent schedular rating nor consideration of TDIU is warranted in the context of this appeal.  To this extent, the Veteran's appeal of his initial PTSD rating is granted.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy is granted.

The Veteran's appeal of the effective date of the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy has a similar procedural history to his appeal of the initial rating assigned for PTSD; however, the Veteran was already entitled to service connection for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy at the time of his November 17, 2017, date of claim, with such claim representing an increased rating claim for the previously service-connected displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy rather than an initial rating appeal as with PTSD.

Like the PTSD rating appeal, the Veteran opted into the modernized review system under the AMA for his increased rating claim for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy after the issuance of the October 2020 SOC, which implemented a staged rating during the applicable rating period awarding a 40 percent rating, effective September 21, 2020, based on an examination conducted on that date.  The lumbar spine rating issue was included in the Veteran's November 2020 supplemental claim that was adjudicated by the aforementioned March 2022 rating decision, which awarded the 50 percent rating for PTSD, but denied an earlier effective date for the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy.  The effective date of the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy was then included in the March 2023 higher-level review request that resulted in the March 2023 rating decision on appeal.  As a result, the evidentiary record for the Veteran's appeal of the effective date of the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy also closed at the time of the March 2022 rating decision.

The Board notes the effective date of an award of increased compensation is typically based on the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  An effective date of an award of increased compensation can be assigned up to one year prior to the date of claim under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during that period.

Here, the AOJ's decision indicates the effective date of the increased 40 percent rating for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy is based on the date entitlement arose - the date of the Veteran's September 2020 spine examination.  The Veteran's representative has asserted an earlier effective date is warranted based on the date of claim because the September 2020 spine examination simply documented the Veteran's reports of increased disability, which had been present since his date of claim - further noting the Veteran's initial January 2018 spine examination fails to comply with applicable case law regarding the adequacy of VA joint examinations.  See Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

The Board finds the Veteran's representative's argument on appeal persuasive.  Indeed, the January 2018 spine examination scheduled in conjunction with the Veteran's November 2017 increased rating claim fails to comply with the holding in Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  Since the January 2018 spine examination report fails to comply with Sharp and is therefore inadequate for rating purposes, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds the September 2020 examination report probative with respect to his level of functional impairment throughout the appeal period, leading to a finding that he has at least as likely as not experienced forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 30 degrees since the date of his November 2017 claim.  The Veteran has not asserted the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) to the general effective date rules for increased rating claims applies in his case, and the record does not otherwise establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the Veteran's date of claim.  Nevertheless, an effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy is warranted, when reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor, resulting in a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal in this regard.

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 20 percent rating assigned for left femoral radiculopathy is granted.

4. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 20 percent rating assigned for left sciatic radiculopathy is granted.

5. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 20 percent rating assigned for right femoral radiculopathy is denied.

An October 2020 rating decision issued in conjunction with the October 2020 SOC for the Veteran's lumbar spine rating appeal awarded separate 20 percent ratings for left femoral radiculopathy, left sciatic radiculopathy, and right femoral radiculopathy, effective September 21, 2020, as an element of the Veteran's November 2017 increased rating claim for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy.  The October 2020 rating decision based the effective dates of the new 20 percent ratings on a finding that September 21, 2020, was the date entitlement arose based on an examination conducted on that date.  In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a higher-level review request for the effective dates of these ratings, which was adjudicated in a September 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran then submitted a supplemental claim in September 2022 to support his request for an earlier effective date.  The September 2022 rating decision on appeal denied an earlier effective date based on a finding that the evidence fails to establish entitlement arose prior to September 2020.

The Board finds the Veteran has at least as likely as not experienced moderate incomplete paralysis of the left femoral nerve, left sciatic nerve, and right femoral nerve from the date of his November 2017 claim as asserted on appeal.  The Board acknowledges a January 2018 VA examiner reported the Veteran did not have radiculopathy affecting the bilateral lower extremities, with similar findings noted on a March 2018 peripheral nerve examination report completed as an amendment to the initial January 2018 thoracolumbar spine examination report; however, the Veteran was already entitled to service connection for neurological impairment of the bilateral lower extremities at that time based on impairment associated with displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy, which has been present since at least 2006 as documented in treatment records.  The 2018 examination report fails to adequately discuss the recorded history of the neurological impairment of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities due to displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy.  The assessment of the September 2020 examiner appears more consistent with this documented history.  As a result, the Board finds the September 2020 examination report persuasive regarding the Veteran's level of functional impairment throughout the applicable rating period based on his November 2017 claim.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the criteria for earlier effective dates for the separate 20 percent ratings assigned for left femoral radiculopathy, left sciatic radiculopathy, and right femoral radiculopathy is warranted.

As noted in the context of the previously discussed effective date of the increased 40 percent rating assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy, the Board again recognizes the effective date of an award of increased compensation is typically based on the date of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  An effective date of an award of increased compensation can be assigned up to one year prior to the date of claim under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during that period.

The Veteran has not asserted the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) to the general effective date rules for increased rating claims applies in his case, and the record does not otherwise establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the Veteran's date of claim.  In contrast, the Board has liberally construed evidence created well after the date of claim, i.e., September 2020 examination report, as a persuasive assessment of the impairment reported at the time of the Veteran's claim.  There is no evidence suggesting a factually ascertainable increase in neurological impairment of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities in the one-year period prior to his November 2017 claim.

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, for the 20 percent rating assigned for right knee instability is granted. 

The Veteran's appeal of the effective date of the 20 percent rating assigned for right knee instability has the same procedural posture as the ratings assigned for displacement of intervertebral disc without myelopathy and associated neurological impairment of the bilateral lower extremities.  The separate rating for instability was awarded in the context of the Veteran's November 2017 increased rating claim for his previously service-connected right knee disability based on a September 2020 examination report.  The Veteran asserts his right knee instability has been present throughout the applicable rating period but not adequately assessed until the September 2020 examination.  The Board notes lay repots are generally considered competent to establish the presence of some degree on instability.  See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 349 (2018).  There is no evidence of record that directly rebuts the Veteran's lay reports regarding instability.  As a result, the Board finds his reports both credible and competent to establish instability throughout the rating period based on his November 2017 increased rating claim.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor regarding the degree of instability, an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, is warranted for the 20 percent rating assigned for right knee instability.

Similar to the other issues on appeal, the Veteran has not asserted the exception under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) to the general effective date rules for increased rating claims applies in his case, and the record does not otherwise establish a factually ascertainable increase in disability in the one-year period prior to the Veteran's date of claim.  In contrast, the Board has liberally construed evidence created well after the date of claim, i.e., the September 2020 examination report, as a persuasive assessment of the impairment reported at the time of the Veteran's claim.  There is no evidence suggesting a factually ascertainable increase in right knee disability in the one-year period prior to his November 2017 claim.  Nevertheless, an earlier effective date of November 17, 2017, is warranted for the 20 percent rating assigned for right knee instability, as asserted on appeal.  To this extent, the Veteran's appeal is granted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
