REMANDED

Service connection for lower back pain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran honorably served in the U.S. Army from August 1989 to January 1991.  

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) supplemental claim rating decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of [list claims], any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Lower back pain

When the Secretary provides a veteran with a VA medical examination or opinion, it must be adequate.  A medical opinion is adequate when it is based upon consideration of the veteran's prior medical history and describes the disability in detail sufficient for the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability to be fully informed.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); See also Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).    

When conducting a medical examination or providing a medical opinion, an examiner must be fully cognizant of the claimant's past medical history.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).

A medical opinion is inadequate when it fails to address all raised theories of entitlement.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013) (stating that a secondary service connection medical opinion was inadequate because it did not discuss aggravation); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123-24 (2007) (holding that a medical nexus opinion finding a condition is not related to service because the condition is not entitled to presumptive service connection, without first considering direct service connection, is inadequate on its face); Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that direct service connection must be discussed when presumptive service connection is not warranted).

During the April 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported her back pain began during her in-service pregnancy.  In the associated disability benefits questionnaire, the examiner found her disability was less likely than not due to service.  They explained that "the actual diagnosis based on testing with x-ray is degenerative arthritis of lumbar spine with lumbar scoliosis and subluxation of coccyx based on radiologist's preliminary read of the report. she did not have this finding during military or active duty service."  However, they failed to discuss the Veteran's raised theory of entitlement.  Therefore, the examination fails to consider the Veteran's medical history and address all raised theories of entitlement, and remand is required for supplemental opinion.

?

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain a supplemental medical opinion discussing whether the Veterans low back pain was caused or aggravated by service, to include her in-service pregnancy.  A new examination may be scheduled at the examiner's or AOJ's discretion.
