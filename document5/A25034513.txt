ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided by the appellant on June 5, 2020, (Claim ID 302030300057680000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment for the June 5, 2020, episode of care provided to the Veteran by the appellant.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment for non-VA medical services provided on June 5, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Deaconess Emergency Physician GW, is a non-VA medical provider that furnished medical services to the Veteran on June 5, 2020.?

In January 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA Medical Center for the June 5, 2020, episode of care.

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on June 5, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record includes a Decision Review document indicating that the prior decision had been overturned and the claim approved in an August 30, 2021 decision.  In addition, an August 2021 Report of Contact indicates that payment in the amount of $80.29 had been approved for this claim and would be paid.  

The Board acknowledges that the payment may be less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the June 5, 2020, episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

[CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE]

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the June 5, 2020, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the prior denial, and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
