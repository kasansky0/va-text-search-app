DOCKET NO. 210826-181714
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is dismissed.

Entitlement to rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On April 10, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1985 to June 1985 and January 1991 to March 1991.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2021 under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system.

In August 2021, the Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board and selected the hearing lane for this claim.  

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  In the present case, the appellant, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.  Id.  The withdrawal must include the name of the appellant, the applicable file number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205; see Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet.  App. 1, 6 (2020).

In an April 2025 correspondence, the Veteran notified the Board that he wished to withdraw his appeals concerning an increased rating for his right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy and left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy.  See April 2025 Correspondence.

Given the withdrawal includes the name of the Veteran, the applicable file number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn, the Board finds the appeal to be withdrawn.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, supra.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
