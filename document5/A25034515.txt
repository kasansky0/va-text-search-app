ORDER

The appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for low back condition, left lower extremity radiculopathy, and right lower extremity radiculopathy is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On August 28, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the appeal seeking entitlement to service connection for low back condition, left lower extremity radiculopathy, and right lower extremity radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1983 to January 1993.  The matter is on appeal under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) from a rating decision issued in July 2021.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) received in June 2022, electing the hearing docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.   An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The Veteran submitted a written statement on August 28, 2024 that included the VA file number, AMA docket number assigned to this appeal, and a statement requesting that his appeal before the Board be withdrawn.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
