ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's tinnitus began during active service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against the finding that the Veteran had an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a low back condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a low back condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1981 to October 1984.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for PTSD; this claim has been expanded from the Veteran's original claim to include all acquired psychiatric disorders. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (finding a claimant without medical expertise cannot be expected to precisely delineate the diagnosis of his mental illness).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Under applicable law, service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999). Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

A lay witness is competent to testify as to the occurrence of an in-service injury or incident where such issue is factual in nature. Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993). In some cases, lay evidence will also be competent and credible on the issues of diagnosis and etiology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Specifically, lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis where (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d at 1377; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). A layperson is competent to identify a medical condition where the condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 307 (2007).

Additionally, where symptoms are capable of lay observation, a lay witness is competent to testify to a lack of symptoms prior to service, continuity of symptoms after in-service injury or disease, and receipt of medical treatment for such symptoms. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus first manifested in service due to exposure to supplying the howitzer. See September 2023 VA examination.

Tinnitus is found to be capable of lay observation, and thus his statements constitute competent evidence. The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303?(2007). In Charles v. Principi,?16 Vet. App. 370, 374-375?(2002), the Court specifically held that tinnitus is a condition which is capable of lay observation. See also Washington v. Nicholson,?19 Vet. App. 362, 368?(2005); Walker v. Shinseki,?708 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The Board concludes that while the Veteran's tinnitus was not diagnosed during service, the Veteran has reported the onset in service, and there has been continuity of the same symptomatology since his separation from service in October 1984. 

In his December 2022 Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran related that he has constant ringing in the ears that never goes away.

At the September 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported ringing in his ears and that tinnitus has bothered him since service. The Veteran is competent to state that he has experienced tinnitus since service.

The September 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's description of symptoms does not meet the Dauman and Tyler (1992) definition of tinnitus cited in the Tinnitus Handbook (Tyler). The Veteran reports transient ear noise that occurs in the general population without auditory damage or pathology. The Veteran reports experiencing noise within the ear about once a week for about 60 seconds. Tinnitus experts agree that ear or head sounds must be prolonged, lasting more than five minutes at a time and occurring more than once per week to be considered actual tinnitus. This transient ear noise is not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus and is less likely than not related to military noise exposure. The etiology of tinnitus is not warranted when symptomatology and clinical exam findings do not indicate a diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus.

While the examiner found that the Veteran's reported transient ear noise is not consistent with noise-induced tinnitus, his head noise has not otherwise been determined to have not had its direct onset in service. The Veteran has contended that his symptoms have persisted ever since service. The Board finds that the evidence of record is in relative?equipoise?and, affording the Veteran the?benefit of the doubt, service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.

There are particular requirements for establishing PTSD in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f), which take precedence over the general requirements for establishing service connection in 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Establishment of service connection for PTSD requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2023. After examination, it was noted that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis. The examiner explained that the Veteran did not report valid criterion A stressors, and the Veteran's symptoms do not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD or any formal mental health diagnosis.

Additional treatment records were reviewed; however, there is no diagnosis of PTSD or other acquired psychiatric disorder in the claims file.

The Board notes that the Veteran has asserted he suffers from an acquired psychiatric disorder. Complaints, however, are not enough to establish service connection. There must be competent evidence of a current disability or functional impairment resulting from that condition or injury.

The Board has considered the Veteran's arguments. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experiences; for example, he is competent to discuss current pain and other experienced symptoms. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).

Additionally, while the Veteran is competent to report a contemporaneous medical diagnosis and is competent in describing symptoms that support a later diagnosis by a medical professional, there is no competent evidence from any health-care provider that he has a post-service diagnosis of PTSD or an acquired psychiatric disorder.

The Board finds that the most probative evidence consists of the medical records. The Board assigns greater probative value to the June 2023 VA medical opinion as it was prepared by a skilled, neutral medical professional after examining the Veteran and considering his symptoms in the context of the diagnostic criteria in the DSM-V. Indeed, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his symptoms are manifestations of an acquired psychiatric disorder related to service. Although the Board recognizes that a lay person may competently report subjective feelings, the Board looks to the medical evidence of record to determine whether a current psychiatric disability exists, and whether it is etiologically related to service. Here, there is no persuasive credible medical opinion evidence in favor of the claim.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to service connection for a low back condition

The Veteran contends that he has a low back condition due to falling off of a truck during active service. See December 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is approximately at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current low back disability and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

A review of the Veteran's available treatment records shows no diagnosis of a low back disability during the pendency of this claim. The Veteran's service treatment records also do not show treatment for a low back injury.

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of a low back disability, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires a specialized medical education and knowledge of the interaction between multiple organ systems in the body. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence. There is also no persuasive evidence of symptoms that result in any functional impairment in earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that a "disability" under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to functional impairment of earning capacity).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to service connection for a low back condition is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
