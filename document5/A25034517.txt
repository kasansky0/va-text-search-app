DOCKET NO. 210524-162630
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of entitlement to an increased rating for tension headaches and a total disability rating based on unemployability due to service connected disabilities (TDIU), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On May 21, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1989 to May 1993.  This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the May 24, 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by an appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a May 2024 statement in support of claim seeking withdrawal of his appeal for an increased rating for tension headaches and TDIU as listed on the May 2021 VA Form 10182.  Thus, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
