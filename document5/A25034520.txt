ORDER

Entitlement to VA payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not identify any decision concerning the denial of payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses, or otherwise identify any specific denial of payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical care that he wished to appeal.    

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no matter for appellate consideration, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201-20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1974 to August 1975.    

In June 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and selected Evidence Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

The VA Form 10182 is the form designated for filing an appeal of a denial of VA benefits by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) to the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board).  On the VA Form 10182, the appellant is instructed to identify the specific decision that is being appealed by putting the date of the decision in the "Date of Decision" column.  The appellant is also instructed to identify the "specific issues" that he wishes to appeal in an adjoining column.  

On the June 2020 VA Form 10182, the Veteran wrote the following in the Date of Decision column: "?", indicating that he was not sure of the date of any decision he intended to appeal.  In the separate column designated for listing the specific issues he intended to appeal, he wrote the following: 'The Wolfe case' "2019."  This is a reference to Wolfe v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 1 (2019), a Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) decision, which determined that for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses under 38 U.S.C. § 1725, the portion of the cost of the care not covered by non-VA insurance, which constituted deductible and coinsurance amounts, could be paid or reimbursed by VA.  Notably, this decision was subsequently modified by a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision, which determined that non-VA insurance deductible amounts could be excluded from payment or reimbursement by VA, but that coinsurance amounts could not be excluded from such payment or reimbursement.  Wolfe v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

In response to the June 2020 NOD, the Board sent the Veteran a February 2024 letter asking him to submit a new VA Form 10182 where he identified the specific issue or issues he wanted to appeal.  The letter informed the Veteran that if the Board did not receive the new Form 10182 within 60 days, the June 2020 Form 10182 would not be considered a valid appeal.  The February 2024 letter was sent to the Veteran's current address of record and also to the Veteran's representative.  To date, a response has not been received from either party.  

In regard to the mailing to the Veteran, the February 2024 letter was returned as undeliverable.  Notably, the Veteran retains the duty to inform VA of any address changes.  Hyson v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 262, 265 (1993) (holding that in the normal course of events, it is the burden of the veteran to keep VA apprised of his whereabouts).  Consequently, BVA fulfilled its notice obligation by sending the letter requesting the Veteran identify the specific issue(s) he wanted to appeal to the address of record, along with sending a copy to his representative.          

For each claim received by VA identifying an issue, including those seeking payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses, VA will issue a decision, along with notice of that decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151(c)(1), 20.200, 20.203(b).  Notices of VA decisions are issued to claimants by mail, and an appeal of a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in response to the mailed notice, in accordance with VA provisions, which must identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201-20.204.  The Board may dismiss any appeal, which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

As noted above, the June 2020 NOD does not identify any specific determination that the Veteran wished to appeal.  It also does not identify any specific issue that the Veteran wished to appeal, referring only to the holding in Wolfe, without identifying any episode of non-VA medical care for which the Veteran may have been denied payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. § 1725.  

Additionally, pursuant to the Board's inquiry, a representative from the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) conducted a search of its claims databases to determine whether any claims for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses had been inappropriately denied in light of the holding in Wolfe.  See August 2024 VHA representative's report of contact.  However, no such claims were identified.  Given that the Veteran has not identified a specific decision denying payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical expenses, or a specific episode of non-VA medical care for which he was denied such payment or reimbursement; and given that VHA was not able to identify any claims for payment or reimbursement inappropriately denied in light of the holding in Wolfe, the June 2020 NOD cannot be considered a valid appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201-20.204.  Consequently, there is no matter for appellate consideration before the Board at this time.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201-20.204.
