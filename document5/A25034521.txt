REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2009 to November 2013. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board notes the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the period when a docket switch permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has elapsed.  This period ends either one year from the date the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later.  Id.  In the present case, the notification letter for the decision on appeal was issued on September 10, 2024, and the Veteran submitted her VA Form 10182 on September 25, 2024.  Thus, while 60 days after the September 2024 NOD receipt has elapsed, the one-year period following the September 2024 notification letter has not.  However, the decision below is a remand.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice to the Veteran, and the Board will proceed. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.

The Veteran contends she experiences sleep impairment secondary to her service-connected acquired psychiatric disability.  The June 2024 VA opinion only addresses secondary service connection on a causative basis, it does not address whether the Veteran's service-connected acquired psychiatric disability has aggravated the Veteran's sleep apnea.  See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (a medical opinion is inadequate when it fails to adequately address the question of aggravation).

Accordingly, a remand is needed to cure the pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain an opinion for aggravation. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  In remanding this matter, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand. 

2. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician as to the nature and etiology of her sleep apnea disorder.  The examiner must opine as to whether any such disorder at least as likely as not:

(a.) Is aggravated by her service-connected acquired psychiatric disability?

The examiner is advised that aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b) does not require that there be "permanent" worsening of the nonservice connected disability.

Notify the examiner that the Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to attest to matters of which she has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology.

Notify the examiner that the standard "at least as likely as not" is defined as the "likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher." Conversely, "less likely than not" is defined as the "likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal."

?

If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, he or she shall explain why an opinion cannot be given.  In so doing, the examiner shall explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that particular question(s).

A rationale is required for all opinions in the report.
