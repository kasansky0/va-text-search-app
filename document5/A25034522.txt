REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran has had several periods of active service, to include active duty for training from March 2004 to July 2004, and active duty from August 2004 to December 2004, and from May 2009 to March 2010.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) has also recognized subsequent periods of active service, to include from April 2018 to May 2019.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Regarding the Veteran's sleep apnea and back claims, the Board observes that on January 2, 2021, the Veteran filed forms with VA asking that it obtain on his behalf records of VA care from the Birmingham, Alabama VA Medical Center (VAMC) dated from 2011 to the present, and from the Tuscaloosa, Alabama VAMC dated from 2011 to the present.  Although the Veteran's Birmingham records were obtained prior to the April 2021 rating decision on appeal, it does not appear that the AOJ obtained any separate records that may be available from the Tuscaloosa VAMC.  Notably, the Birmingham records obtained in February 2021 specifically reference the Veteran's care at the Tuscaloosa VAMC in an April 24, 2019 treatment report.  Prior to deciding the Veteran's claims, the AOJ should have requested, and associated with the claims file, any additional VA treatment records that may exist from the Tuscaloosa VAMC.  On remand, the AOJ should take efforts to correct this pre-decisional duty-to-assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Concerning the back claim in particular, private treatment reports obtained before the April 2021 rating decision document the Veteran's complaints of an in-service injury occurring in February 2019.  Specifically, a May 9, 2019 private treatment report indicated that the Veteran reported injury to his low back and leg three months prior while doing physical training with the Army.  He indicated he was lifting a weight and felt a pop in his back and sudden burning pain down the leg.   

At the time of the April 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ had only obtained service records pertaining to periods of service prior to February 2019.  Within the rating decision, the AOJ acknowledged the presence of a current back disability that required surgery in July 2019, but denied entitlement to service connection for the disability based in part on a finding that the Veteran's service treatment records did not contain complaints, treatment or diagnoses for the condition.  Because the AOJ was on notice that the Veteran may have performed active service in February 2019 and sustained a back injury therein, it should have taken additional action to verify whether the Veteran's active service included service in February 2019, and if so, whether any corresponding service treatment records existed that pertained to this period of service.  On remand, the AOJ should ensure all relevant service records pertaining to the Veteran's claimed in-service injury in February 2019 are of record.  

The Board adds that the AOJ has since recognized the Veteran's active service from April 2018 to May 2019.  See August 2022, December 2023, and January 2025 rating decisions.  

Concerning the Veteran's sleep apnea claim, the personnel records on file prior to April 2021 rating decision do include a DD Form 214 confirming the Veteran's service in Kuwait and Iraq from June 20, 2009, to February 5, 2010.  Since the April 2021 decision, the PACT Act came into effect, establishing legal presumptions of exposure to burn pits and other toxins for similarly deployed Veterans.  On remand, in addition to obtaining the VA treatment records identified above, the AOJ should ensure that adequate toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) medical opinions have been obtained addressing whether the Veteran's sleep apnea may be related to his in-service exposures.  

Finally, with respect to the Veteran's psychiatric disability claim, the Veteran had previously filed a service-connection claim for PTSD, anxiety and/or depression in December 2013, which the AOJ denied in a June 2014 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal.  

In January 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ requesting entitlement to service connection for PTSD, and for short term memory loss secondary to PTSD.  In a January 22, 2021 letter, the AOJ informed the Veteran that to request review of his previously-denied PTSD claim, he had to file a Supplemental Claim form (i.e., VA Form 20-0995).  Because the Veteran did not respond to this letter prior to the April 2021 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ did not specifically adjudicate whether service connection could be granted for PTSD.  However, the AOJ did adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for short term memory loss.  The AOJ denied the claim making no mention of whether the Veteran's contentions of memory loss might be a component or symptom of PTSD, which, as noted above, the Veteran stipulated was his primary psychiatric disability.  Instead, the AOJ simply indicated that it found no evidence that a short term memory disability was diagnosed.  On his February 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran requested Board review of his PTSD claim.

Here, on the one hand, the AOJ informed the Veteran it would not readjudicate entitlement to service connection for PTSD without a Supplemental Claim form.  Then, on the other, it adjudicated a claim for memory loss that the Veteran contended was specifically due to, or part of, his PTSD.  Importantly, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has held that the scope of a Veteran's claim for psychiatric disability includes any disability that reasonably may be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (per curiam).  

Considering the Court's holding in Clemons, and the unique facts of this case, including the Veteran's own stipulation on his claims form that his memory issues were related to, or part of, his PTSD, the Board finds that the AOJ should not have bifurcated the PTSD and memory loss issues.  Because the AOJ accepted the Veteran's memory loss claim, in this case, it was required to, in turn, address whether the claimed primary disability (i.e., PTSD) may be service-related.  See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 54 (if the condition for which VA benefits is sought is not directly associated with service, but information obtained during the processing of the claim indicates that the causal disease or disability may be associated with service, VA generally must investigate whether the causal disease or disability is related to service, in order to determine whether the claimed condition is related secondarily to service).

Because the AOJ did not address entitlement to service connection for PTSD in the first instance, the issue must be remanded to ensure compliance with 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (all questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the Secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request and associate with the claims file all of the Veteran's records of care from the Tuscaloosa, Alabama VAMC dating from 2011 to the present.  All efforts to obtain such records should be documented in the claims file.

2. Ensure that all steps have been taken to confirm the Veteran's active duty service in February 2019, and to ensure that all related service personnel and medical records pertaining to such service have been added to the file.  

3. Ensure that the record includes adequate toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) medical opinions addressing whether the Veteran's sleep apnea may be related to his in-service exposures.

4. Readjudicate the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability manifesting in short term memory loss, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in the first instance.
