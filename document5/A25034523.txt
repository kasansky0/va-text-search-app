ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for Meniere's disease is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's Meniere's disease is related to active-duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for Meniere's disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2000 to September 2004. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for Meniere's disease.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, or air service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in-service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The Veteran has been diagnosed with Meniere's Disease. See April 2021 Private Treatment Records; VA examinations dated October 2022, November 2022, and October 2023.

In the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs), the Veteran was seen numerous times for ear trouble and dizziness. In February 2001, the Veteran was seen for transient dizziness times two days. In a May 2001 Report of Medical History, the Veteran indicated "yes" to ear trouble and described that her "ears plug up at times." In August 2001, the Veteran described her ear trouble as feeling "clogged up." In March 2003, the Veteran had ear trouble and was seen for frequent otitis media, tinnitus and deafness. In August 2003, the Veteran had right ear pain and described her ears as feeling "clogged up and then pops."

In private treatment records, the Veteran was diagnosed with Meniere's disease and had symptoms of bilateral tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss, history of dizziness, intermittent dizziness, otalgia, and constant right aural fullness or persistent clogged sensation in the right ear. See April 2021, May 2021, and June 2021 Private Treatment Records. The records indicate that the onset for these symptoms began 20 years ago while the Veteran was on active-duty service and as a result of exposure to loud noises in the military. The Veteran began treatment for the disability.

In a June 2022 statement, the Veteran described the loud noises she was exposed to while on active duty. She also described having the symptoms of Meniere's disease while in service and continuously after service, although she was diagnosed after service. Further, the Veteran is service connected for tinnitus due to loud noise exposure to while on active duty.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022, November 2022, and October 2023. The VA examiners diagnosed the Veteran with Meniere's disease and noted the Veteran's history and onset of symptoms. The October 2022 and October 2023 VA examiner provided medical opinions. They both relied on the absence of a diagnosis in the STRs, thus providing an inadequate medical opinion. The October 2022 VA examiner did not address any of the Veteran's lay statements or STRs that indicated the Veteran sought medical attention for ear trouble. The October 2023 VA examiner only commented on the "ears plug up at time" in 2001 STRs but did not address any of the other symptoms for the Veteran's ear troubles while in service. Thus, the opinions provided by the VA examiners are of limited probative value.

The Veteran provided a private medical opinion by C.E. in September 2023. The private opinion reviewed the Veteran's history, symptoms while in service, and lay statements, including exposure to loud noises. The opinion concluded that the Veteran's Meniere's disease is at least as likely as not directly related to her military service. The clinician also supported her opinion by citing and summarizing numerous medical articles showing the link between Meniere's disease and acoustic trauma. The Board finds this opinion of significant probative value.

The Veteran asserts that the onset of her Meniere's disease occurred in service and has continued intermittently since service. The Veteran is competent to provide lay evidence as to her subjectively experienced symptoms. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (non-expert witnesses are competent to report that which they have observed with their own senses). 

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's Meniere's disease is causally related to service. In that regard, the law is clear. Pursuant to the "benefit-of-the-doubt" rule, where there is "an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter," the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  The Board concludes that, with the benefit of the doubt resolved in the Veteran's favor, a grant of service connection for Meniere's disease is warranted. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990) ("[T]he 'benefit of the doubt' standard is similar to the rule deeply embedded in sandlot baseball folklore that 'the tie goes to the runner'.... [I]f... the play is close, i.e., 'there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence,' the veteran prevails by operation of statute.").
