ORDER

An initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for headaches as secondary to tinnitus.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's initial 10 percent rating for tinnitus is the maximum schedular rating.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1993 to May 1997.

The case is on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.

In a May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Direct Review option.  Therefore, the Board has considered the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision.

An initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.

The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus, and a higher rating is not permissible.  See Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Accordingly, an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is not warranted.

However, for reasons stated below, the Board finds remand warranted to determine if the Veteran's headaches are related to his tinnitus.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for headaches.

The Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the RO to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran if the error occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  VA is obligated to develop and adjudicate claims for secondary service connection that are reasonably raised during the processing of a properly initiated claim as to the primary service-connected disability's evaluation level.  Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 201 (2021).

The Veteran asserted in his September 2023 claim that his tinnitus results in headaches.  During a November 2023 VA examination, the examiner also noted the Veteran's reports of headaches due to his tinnitus.  This evidence raises a claim of service connection for headaches, secondary to tinnitus.  See Bailey, 33 Vet. App. at 201.  Additionally, the evidence is sufficient to warrant an examination.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d).  The RO thus should have ordered an examination and medical opinion on the relationship between the Veteran's headaches and his tinnitus prior to the rating decision on appeal.  Remand for this development is therefore warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriately qualified clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any headaches. The examiner should review the entire claims file and this remand in conjunction with the examination.

For any headaches, the examiner should state whether they are at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any such disability is caused by, or aggravated by, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus. 

The examiner must address any relevant lay statements of record regarding the onset and continuity of the Veteran's symptoms and include a well-reasoned rationale in support of the opinions offered.  If an intercurrent cause of the Veteran's disability is suspected, it should be identified, and any medical literature consulted should be cited.
