FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time of the September 2018 rating decision, the evidence did not establish that an improvement in the Veteran's service-connected low back disability had actually occurred which resulted in an improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life.

2. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's low back disability manifested in pain and reduced range of motion, but did not more nearly approximate ankylosis of any segment of the spine. 

3. At the time of the September 2018 rating decision, the evidence did not establish that an improvement in the Veteran's service-connected sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity had actually occurred which resulted in an improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life. 

4. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity manifested in pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias most nearly approximating moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve; there was no evidence of marked muscular atrophy or no active movement of the muscles below the knee such that the symptoms approximated severe incomplete or complete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve.

5. Prior to October 11, 2022, the Veteran's sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity manifested in no more than mild pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias such that the symptoms most nearly approximated mild incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.

6. On and after October 11, 2022, the Veteran's sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity manifested in moderate pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias most nearly approximated moderate incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve; the impairment was wholly sensory. 

7. The first evidence establishing the presence of femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities is a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) examination dated October 11, 2022.

8. On and after October 11, 2022, the Veteran's femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities manifested in moderate pain, numbness, and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias such that the symptoms most nearly approximated moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerves; the impairment was wholly sensory.

9. The Veteran has been unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities since March 16, 2015.

10. The Veteran is now in receipt of a total disability rating from March 16, 2015.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1972 to December 1974.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from decisions by a VA regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The procedural history of this appeal is somewhat complex. In March 2015, the Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU that the AOJ also construed as a claim for increased ratings for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, which at that time included the low back disability and sciatic radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities. In September 2015, the AOJ issued a legacy rating decision denying an increased rating for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity and proposing to decrease the disability ratings for the lower back disability from 40 percent to 10 percent and for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity from 40 percent to 20 percent. The AOJ decreased each of these ratings to 20 percent in a September 2018 rating decision, effective December 1, 2018. The Veteran initiated a legacy appeal of the rating decreases in July 2019, and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in January 2020. The Veteran then opted these claims into the modernized appeal system by filing a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, in March 2020, identifying the January 2020 SOC as the decision on appeal. The AOJ issued an HLR decision in March 2020, and the Veteran subsequently filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, in January 2021. The AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal in October 2022, continuing the 20 percent ratings for the low back disability and for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, granting a 20 percent rating for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity effective October 11, 2022, and granting service connection for femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, assigning 20 percent disability ratings for each extremity effective October 11, 2022. 

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the October 2022 decision and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Notably, the Veteran filed separate claims for TDIU, and the claim was eventually granted in a May 2023 rating decision, effective January 7, 2021. Subsequently in a June 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found clear and unmistakable error in the original award and assigned a TDIU from October 11, 2022. While the Veteran appealed the June 2023 rating decision along with the other matters on appeal in the October 2023 VA Form 10182, the Board notes that the Veteran has continuously raised the matter of entitlement to a TDIU throughout the period on appeal, and it is part and parcel of his increased ratings claims. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (holding that a request for TDIU, whether expressly raised by the veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate "claim" for benefits, but rather, is part of a claim for increased compensation). As such, the Board may consider whether entitlement to a TDIU is warranted throughout the increased rating period on appeal. Entitlement to DEA benefits is ancillary to the award of a total rating. 

Increased Ratings 

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Different ratings may be assigned for different periods of time for the same disorder if the facts show distinct time periods with different levels of disability. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

With a rating reduction that results in a reduction in the overall amount of compensation paid, VA must comply with the notice procedures of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320, 325 (1995). When VA makes a rating reduction without following the applicable regulations, the reduction is void ab initio. Greyzck v. West, 12 Vet. App. 288, 292 (1999). VA must issue a rating action proposing the reduction and set forth all material facts and reasons for the reduction. The Veteran must then be given sixty days to submit additional evidence and thirty days to request a predetermination hearing. A rating action then will be taken to effectuate the reduction. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), (i).

There is no question that a disability may be reduced; however, the circumstances under which rating reductions can occur are specifically limited and carefully circumscribed by regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 apply to rating reductions. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires that, when a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted, and a reduction will result in a decrease in payment of compensation benefits being made, a rating proposing reduction will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified and furnished detailed reasons therefore and given 60 days for presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the current level. If additional evidence is not received within that period, a final rating action will be taken and the award will be reduced effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(i), the advance written notice concerning a proposed rating reduction must inform the beneficiary that he has a right to a predetermination hearing provided that a request for such a hearing is received by VA within 30 days from the date of the notice. The procedural framework and safeguards set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 governing rating reductions are required to be followed by VA before it issues any final rating reduction. See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 418 (1993).

Generally, a disability rating will not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. In any rating reduction case, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability actually has occurred, and also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000); Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1993); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction evidence may be considered to determine whether the condition had demonstrated actual improvement. Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992).

For ratings in effect for less than five years, adequate reexamination that discloses improvement in the disability warrants reduction in rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c). For ratings in effect for five years or more, 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a)-(b) applies. The relevant period for this purpose is calculated from the effective date of the establishment of the former rating to the effective date of the reduction.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that several general regulations are applicable to all rating reduction cases, without regard for how long a particular rating has been in effect. Moreover, the Court has stated that certain regulations "impose a clear requirement that VA rating reductions, as with all VA rating decisions, be based upon a review of the entire history of the veteran's disability." Brown, 1 Vet. App. at 420 (referring to 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.13). A rating reduction requires an inquiry as to "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations." See Brown at 421.

Significantly, in a rating reduction case, VA has the burden of establishing that the disability has improved. This is in stark contrast to a case involving a claim for an increased (i.e., higher) rating, in which it is the Veteran's responsibility to show that the disability has worsened. A rating reduction case focuses on the propriety of the reduction, and is not the same as an increased rating issue. See Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991). In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the condition had demonstrated actual improvement. Cf. Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. at 281-282.

1. Entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent for a low back disability from December 1, 2018.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for a low back disability.

The Veteran asserts that he should be afforded a higher disability rating for his low back disability. Effective December 1, 2018, his 40 percent disability rating, in effect since January 2004, was reduced to 20 percent. This appeal stems from a March 2015 claim for a TDIU that was construed by the AOJ as an increased rating claim.

The Veteran's low back disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242. Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. Id. at Note 1.  

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching." Id. at Note 5. Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis. Id. 

The Veteran first underwent VA examination in connection with this claim in September 2015. He described daily pain, sometimes sharp and sometimes a dull ache. He stated that the pain went down his legs and his right leg went numb about once a week. He treated his pain with naproxen. The Veteran complained of flare-ups with emotional stress or sitting, consisting of stiffness and his leg becoming numb. The examiner noted that the examination was being conducted during a flare-up. He stated that it was difficult to sit for long periods of time, to lift, or to climb a ladder. Range of motion testing revealed flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right lateral flexion to 20 degrees, left lateral flexion to 30 degrees, right lateral rotation to 20 degrees, and right lateral flexion 30 degrees. There was no additional loss of motion on repetitive-use testing. While the Veteran demonstrated guarding and localized tenderness, they did not result in an abnormal gait or spinal contour. There was no evidence of ankylosis of intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS). The Veteran used a brace occasionally. The examiner opined that the Veteran would not be able to participate in employment that required prolonged standing, sitting, bending, twisting, or heavy lifting.

As a result of the September 2015 VA examination, the AOJ proposed to reduce the disability rating from 40 percent to 20 percent. However, before the reduction was implemented, another VA examination was conducted in September 2018. The Veteran again described flare-ups consisting of sharp pain and stiffness, with difficulty standing and walking for long periods. Range of motion testing showed flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, bilateral lateral flexion to 20 degrees, and bilateral lateral rotation to 20 degrees. The examiner noted pain with weight-bearing. Upon repetitive-use testing, forward flexion was to 55 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, bilateral lateral flexion to 15 degrees, and bilateral lateral rotation to 15 degrees. The examiner opined that, with repeated use over time and on flare-up flexion would be limited to 50 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively, with extension to 10 degrees, bilateral lateral flexion to 10 degrees, and bilateral lateral rotation to 10 degrees. There was no evidence of guarding, muscle spasm, atrophy, or ankylosis. The Veteran regularly used a cane, and had difficulty with bending over or heavy lifting. 

In September 2018, the AOJ effectuated the rating reduction to 20 percent, effective December 1, 2018. The Veteran was again afforded a VA examination in November 2018. He complained of low back pain at the lumbosacral junction radiating to the right and left sides and to the lower extremities. He stated that his symptoms were worsening over time. He used a cane on "bad days," but stated he took almost no medication. The Veteran did not report flare-ups. Range of motion testing showed flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, bilateral lateral flexion to 30 degrees, and bilateral lateral rotation to 30 degrees. The examiner noted no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain to palpation, nor any evidence of pain on weight-bearing. The examiner opined that there would be no additional loss of motion with repeated use over time. The Veteran reported occasional use of a cane as well as difficulty with running, prolonged walking, or heavy lifting. 

The Veteran again underwent VA examination in connection with this claim in September 2021. He stated that his back pain had increased, but that he had not been seen by a provider for back pain in over a year and had no prescribed medications. He used over-the-counter painkillers to manage his pain. He described intermittent, sharp, shooting pain from the lower back to the right lower extremity with numbness and tingling down to the knee. He did not describe flare-ups, but did note difficulty lifting heavy items and bending over as well as pain with prolonged walking or standing. Range of motion testing showed flexion to 65 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right lateral flexion to 15 degrees, left lateral flexion to 20 degrees, right lateral rotation to 20 degrees, and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees, with pain on all planes of motion. The Veteran was not able to perform repetitive-use testing due to fear of increased pain. The examiner opined that, with repeated use over time, flexion would be limited to 55 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, right lateral flexion to 10 degrees, left lateral flexion to 15 degrees, right lateral rotation to 15 degrees, and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees. Muscle strength testing was normal and there was no evidence of atrophy or ankylosis

In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that restoration of the 40 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected low back disability effective from December 1, 2018, is warranted.

As a preliminary matter, because the 40 percent evaluation for the low back disability was in effect for more than 5 years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a)-(b), which pertain to evaluations in effect for more than five years, are for application in this case.

The Board finds that the reduction in the rating for the low back disability from 40 to 20 percent was improper because the September 2015 VA examination (on which the reduction was initially based) did not demonstrate improvement that reflects an improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). VA may not reduce a rating simply on the basis that the Veteran does not actually meet certain schedular criteria, unless the underlying disorder has shown improvement or clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is shown in the determination to assign the disability rating (which the AOJ did not find here). While the September 2015 and subsequent VA examinations showed improved in range of motion, the Veteran continued to complain of severe pain and stiffness, additionally reduced range of motion on flare-up and with repeated use over time, and difficulty with the activities of daily living that required movement such as bending, lifting, and prolonged walking or standing. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence at the time of rating reduction did not show actual improvement in the Veteran's service-connected disability. Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the AOJ did not observe the applicable law and regulations in reducing the disability rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected low back disability to a 20 percent rating effective from December 1, 2018, and restoration of the 40 percent rating is warranted.

However, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent for the low back disability. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, pain during flare-ups, and pain during repetitive use over time. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. The Veteran retained a functional range of motion throughout the entire period on appeal, including during flare-ups and with repeated use over time. The evidence does not show, nor does the Veteran allege, that the Veteran's symptoms are like unfavorable ankylosis. 

In evaluating the Veteran's low back disability, the Board is cognizant of the fact that the Veteran has used pain medications to treat his back pain. The Court has held that in assigning disability ratings, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). More recently, the Court stated that the "the Board [is] obligated to discount the beneficial effects of the medication taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity of those disabilities" and held that "Jones applies in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant [diagnostic code] does not reference medication as a factor in evaluation." Ingram v. Shinseki, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025).

The Board notes, however, that neither Jones nor Ingram address how the Board is to discount the beneficial effects of medication, particularly when used as treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms and where examiners do not reasonably have the ability to assess range of motion both with and without use of medication. Remanding these claims in order to obtain addendum medical opinions based on Jones and Ingram, and in the lens of the rating criteria under § 4.71a, would almost certainly require examiners to engage in medical speculation and would result in medical opinions that lack the degree of certainty to ascertain, even under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard, the impact of the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of a veteran's musculoskeletal disabilities in terms of range of motion. See, e.g., Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2005) (medical opinions that are speculative have "little probative value"). Significantly, one of the judges in McCarroll, joined by another judge in concurrence, expressed the same concern as to the implications of the holding in Jones:

The requirement that the Secretary "may not consider the relief afforded by [a veteran's] medication when" applying the rating schedule, as Jones demands...invites medical speculation in trying to guess what a veteran's symptoms might be without the medication, or medical malpractice in the cessation of medication so that the veteran's symptoms without medication might be recorded. The former invites non-helpful guesswork by medical practitioners...and the latter raises, at a minimum, serious ethical concerns that no court should encourage. That Jones essentially requires the Board to consider whether a medical examination is required to determine how serious a veteran's symptoms would have been in an alternate reality in which he or she was not taking his or her required medication should alone demonstrate the fallacy of the Jones holding. 

McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 278 (2016) (internal citations omitted). 

Because it is highly unlikely that remand to obtain medical opinions as to the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's back disability would result in probative, non-speculative opinions as to such, the Board does not wish to further delay adjudication of the Veteran's appeal to engage in likely unfruitful further development pursuant to Jones and Ingram. Moreover, the Board certainly cannot - and will not - order the Veteran to stop taking medication to undergo an examination that would reflect the severity of his low back disability without the use of pain medication. This would not only be cruel and potentially damaging to the Veteran, but the undersigned finds it would be legally unethical to ask such.

Finally, the Board notes that VA compensation does not contemplate hypothetical symptoms or impairment. Instead, the purpose of VA benefits is to compensate for decreased earning capacity - to compensate for actual symptoms or impairment that an individual experiences in the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. The Veteran's manifestations of pain have been considered in rating his low back disability, but it still remains the Board's obligation to rate the condition based on the application of the rating criteria found in the diagnostic codes to the objective medical evidence. 

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes. However, the Veteran does not have IVDS and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes. 

Regarding neurological impairment, the lay and medical evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has any other neurological abnormality associated with the spine disability other than those discussed below.

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 40 percent for the low back disability. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

2. Entitlement to restoration of a 40 percent disability rating for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity from December 1, 2018.

3. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.

4. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity prior to October 11, 2022, and in excess of 20 percent thereafter.

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for femoral radiculopathy of the right lower extremity. 

6. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for femoral radiculopathy of the right lower extremity. 

7, Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 11, 2022, for the award of service connection for femoral radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.  

8. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for femoral radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.

The Veteran asserts that he should be afforded higher disability ratings for his service-connected sciatic and femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities. Currently, sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is rated as 40 percent disabling prior to December 1, 2018, and 20 percent disabling thereafter; the rating was reduced in a September 2018 rating decision. Sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is rated 10 percent disabling prior to October 11, 2022, and 20 percent disabling thereafter. Femoral radiculopathy is rated as 20 percent disabling bilateral on and after October 11, 2022; the Veteran also asserts he should be afforded compensable ratings prior to that date. These claims stem from the Veteran's March 2015 claim for a TDIU.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangling and dropping, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

Paralysis of the femoral nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8526. Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles, is rated as 40 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. The Board finds, however, that these terms are unambiguous and, therefore, a plain dictionary meaning is an appropriate definition. Cf. Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.6 (noting, in general, the Board does not evaluate evidence by applying a mechanical formula, but rather conscientiously to the end that its decisions are equitable and just). According to Merriam Webster's Dictionary, "mild" means gentle in nature or behavior, or not severe. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ (accessed March 19, 2025). Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue. The Board must evaluate all evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The Veteran was first afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim in September 2015. With respect to the right lower extremity, he described moderate constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness. With respect to the left lower extremity, he complained of mild constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness. Muscle strength to right knee extension and right ankle plantar flexion was slightly reduced, and knee and ankle reflexes were hypoactive bilaterally. The examiner further noted decreased sensation to the upper anterior thigh and thigh/knee bilaterally. There was no indication of trophic changes or disturbance of gait. The examiner noted the Veteran would have difficulty with sitting, standing, bending, and heavy lifting. Further, the examiner opined that the Veteran had moderate incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve and mild incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve.

In a September 2015 rating decision, the AOJ proposed to decrease the 40 percent rating for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy to 20 percent. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA back examination in September 2018. The examiner noted decreased sensation to the right lower leg/ankle and foot/toes. The Veteran complained of mild intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the right lower extremity, and opined that there was mild incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve. The examiner noted no evidence of left lower extremity radiculopathy. 

In a September 2018 rating decision, the AOJ reduced the rating for right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective December 1, 2018. 

The Veteran next underwent a VA nerve examination in November 2018. He reported pain at the lumbosacral junction in the midline radiating to the iliac crests on both sides and to both lower extremities. He stated that he mainly experienced pain in the hips and proximal thighs, with episodic numbness and tingling in the anterior thighs. He carried a cane. Strength, reflex, light touch/monofilament, and vibration sensation testing yielded normal results. During a November 2018 VA back examination, the examiner noted no evidence of radiculopathy. 

Upon VA back examination in September 2021, the Veteran complained of intermittent sharp shooting pain from the lower back down to the right lower extremity, with numbness and tingling to the right knee. However, the examiner opined that the Veteran did not have radicular pain or any other signs or symptoms due to radiculopathy. While the Veteran was also afforded a VA nerve examination in September 2021, the examination format used was exclusive to diabetic sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy and, thus, does not address radiculopathy. 

The Veteran most recently underwent VA nerve examination in October 2022, at which time the examiner noted radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities. He complained of a feeling like "fire ants" and numbness in both legs, more frequently in the right. The pain was located in the buttock radiating down the sides and tops of the thighs, and sometimes all the way from the waist to the knees. The examiner noted moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness bilaterally. Muscle strength was slightly reduced to knee extension, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion bilaterally, and knee and ankle reflexes were hypoactive. Additionally, sensation to light touch was decreased in the thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes. There was no indication of trophic changes or an abnormal gait. The examiner opined that the Veteran suffered from moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic and femoral nerves bilaterally. The Veteran reported that he had to be careful with his legs and look where he was walking, with his legs tending to give out or get caught on something.

Preliminarily, in considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that restoration of the 40 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity effective from December 1, 2018, is warranted. Because the 40 percent evaluation for the right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy was in effect for more than 5 years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a)-(b), which pertain to evaluations in effect for more than five years, are for application in this case.

The Board finds that the reduction in the rating for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity from 40 to 20 percent was improper because the September 2015 VA examination (on which the reduction was initially based) did not demonstrate improvement that reflects an improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). VA may not reduce a rating simply on the basis that the Veteran does not actually meet certain schedular criteria, unless the underlying disorder has shown improvement or CUE is shown in the determination to assign the disability rating (which the AOJ did not find here). While the September 2015 and subsequent VA examiners opined that the Veteran's sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity was less than moderately severe, the Veteran continued to complain of pain and numbness and frequently required the use of a cane. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence at the time of rating reduction did not show actual improvement in the Veteran's service-connected disability. Under these circumstances, the Board finds that the AOJ did not observe the applicable law and regulations in reducing the disability rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity to a 20 percent rating effective from December 1, 2018, and restoration of the 40 percent rating is warranted.

However, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity. In that regard, ratings higher 40 percent are only available when there is evidence of severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy or complete paralysis, with no active movement possible of muscles below the knee. Here, the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that muscular atrophy or complete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve was present at any time during the period on appeal; motor function was intact upon testing and there was no indication of trophic changes. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to no more than moderately severe incomplete paralysis. As such, a rating in excess of 40 percent for sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is not warranted at any time during the period on appeal.

With regard to sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that a rating in excess of 10 percent is warranted prior to October 11, 2022, or that a rating in excess of 20 percent is warranted thereafter. In that regard, prior to October 11, 2022, sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity was noted only on VA examination in September 2015, at which time the examiner opined it was mild in severity. The Veteran primarily complained of radicular symptoms to the right leg, rather than the left. As such, the Board finds a 10 percent rating is appropriate for this period. For the period on and after, October 11, 2022, however, the evidence shows a worsening of symptoms. In that regard, during a VA examination conducted on that date, the Veteran complained of moderate intermittent pain, dysesthesias and/or paresthesias, and numbness of the left lower extremity, and the examiner opined that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the left lower extremity. Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that a rating in excess of 20 percent is warranted. At no point during the period on appeal does the evidence suggest that involvement of the left sciatic nerve is more than sensory, or that there is complete paralysis of the nerve. As such, an increased rating for sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is not warranted at any point during the period on appeal.

With regard to femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities, the Board finds the first evidence of this condition is the VA examination report dated October 11, 2022. As noted above, the matter of appropriate ratings for the Veteran's back disability and associated neurological disabilities was raised in conjunction with the Veteran's March 2015 claim for a TDIU. However, when an increased rating or separate rating is assigned, the effective date cannot be earlier than the date entitlement for such rating arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. To the extent that the Veteran believes he had the condition prior to the October 11, 2022, while he is competent to report his symptoms, he is not competent to attribute them to radiculopathy of a particular nerve, as such a finding requires medical knowledge and interpretation of complicated diagnostic testing. As there is no evidence of femoral radiculopathy prior to October 11, 2022, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that entitlement to separate ratings for femoral radiculopathy arose prior to that date. 

As to the proper rating for femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities on and after October 11, 2022, the Board finds the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that ratings in excess of 20 percent are warranted. In that regard, the Veteran complained of moderate intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness of the bilateral lower extremities, and the examiner opined that there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerves. The evidence does not show that such paralysis causes symptoms other than sensory, as would be required for the assignment of higher ratings. Accordingly, the Board finds ratings in excess of 20 percent for femoral radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities is not warranted and the claims are denied.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 11, 2022, for the award of a TDIU.

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 11, 2022, for eligibility for DEA benefits.

The Veteran asserts that he last held gainful employment in August 2014 and has been unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities since 2015. 10/10/2023 VA Form 10182. This appeal stems from a March 16, 2015, claim. Upon review, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have rendered him unemployable for VA purposes since March 16, 2015. 

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows a veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience, by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). In arriving at a conclusion, consideration may be given to the veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his age or the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 has two components. First, there is an economic component which essentially contemplates an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Second, there is a non-economic component dealing with the individual veteran's ability to "follow and secure" employment. For the second component, attention must be given to: (a) the veteran's history, education, skill and training, (b) the veteran's physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities (e.g., sedentary, light, medium, heavy or very heavy) required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, reaching, auditory and visual, and (c) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, with relevant factors such as memory, concentration, and ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers and demonstrate reliability and productivity. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). As "sedentary" is defined as "[r]equiring or marked by much sitting <a sedentary desk job>" the Board finds that sedentary employment is a job where the worker primarily sits down. Webster's II New College Dictionary 999 (1999).

If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for TDIU benefits; if there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

During the period on appeal, following the restoration of disability ratings granted above, the Veteran is in receipt of service connection for the following disabilities: low back disability, rated as 40 percent disabling; sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, rated as 40 percent disabling; sciatic radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, rated as 10 percent disabling prior to October 11, 2022, and 20 percent disabling thereafter; femoral radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, rated as 20 percent disabling on and after October 11, 2022; and femoral radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, rated as 20 percent disabling on and after October 11, 2022. The Veteran meets the threshold schedular disability percentage requirement for TDIU consideration as a result of his service-connected low back disability and sciatic radiculopathy of the right lower extremity rated as 40 percent disabling and a combined disability rating of at least 70 percent throughout the period on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran reported that he worked full-time in 2013 and 2014 as a painter for a hotel and as an orderly at a hospital. 03/16/2015 VA 21-8940. From 2015 to 2017, he did some freelance home repair work, but never more than 8 to 15 hours per week. 01/07/2021 VA 21-8940. From December 2018 to May 2020, he worked as a security guard for a campground. Id. Social Security Administration records reflect that he earned less than $12,000 in 2019, below the poverty threshold for that year, and less than $1000 for each other year in question. 01/07/2021 SSA/SSI Letter; see United States Census Bureau, "Poverty Thresholds," https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html. As such, the Board finds the Veteran has engaged in no more than marginal employment throughout the period on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The limitations caused by each of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities has been described in detail above. Primarily, his service-connected low back disability and associated neurological impairments cause him severe pain, difficulty with prolonged sitting, standing, and walking, and reduced range of motion. When taken as a whole, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's symptoms show he was unable to obtain and maintain employment on and after March 16, 2015, the date VA received the claim for a TDIU, which also gave rise to the appeals for increased ratings for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. Given the Veteran's work history, symptoms reported by the Veteran, and the level of functional impairment as reported by VA examiners and treatment providers, the Board considers this level of impairment as one that would preclude employment. After review of the evidence of record the Board finds that the Veteran's functional limitations would preclude employment consistent with his work history, including jobs in painting, security, and as a hospital orderly. In that regard, his high level of physical impairment would likely prohibit this type of work, which is largely labor-intensive.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his service-connected disabilities. Thus, resolving the benefit of the doubt in his favor, a TDIU is warranted on and after March 16, 2015, and, to that extent, the claim is granted.

As this decision results in the assignment of a total disability rating from March 16, 2015, basic eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is granted as an ancillary matter. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a)(2).
