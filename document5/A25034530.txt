REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1979 to October 1983.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2022 decision.  In September 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2022 decision.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding all of the claims in this decision, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for left shoulder pain is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder pain is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for lower back pain is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for migraines is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his disabilities are due to his service.  Specifically, he asserts that his shoulder pain was caused by carrying a "wall locker outside Leonard Wood, MI" that his lower back pain was caused by "jump[ing] off a 5-ton and landing wrong," and that his migraines were caused by "exposure to loud explosions" while serving as a demolition's specialist.  See January 2022 VA Claim.

A December 3, 1980, service treatment record shows that the Veteran was struck in the side of the head, leaving a 1.5 inch laceration near the left ear.

The Veteran was denied exams for a lack of evidence of current disabilities and a lack of evidence of in-service injuries or disease.  The Veteran is competent to report persistent symptoms.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran has also provided lay statements of when the injuries occurred.  His statements made with his January 2022 VA Claim are an indication that the current symptoms or disabilities may be associated with the asserted in-service events.  As such, the low bar for providing a VA examination to consider these have been met.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

Thus, while the Board regrets further delay, a remand is necessary to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed left shoulder pain.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) The clinician should opine whether the Veteran's left shoulder pain is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service.

2. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed right shoulder pain.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) The clinician should opine whether the Veteran's right shoulder pain is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service.

3. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed low back pain.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) Opine whether the Veteran's low back pain is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service.

4. Schedule a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to address the claimed migraines.  The examiner must address the following:

(A) Opine whether the Veteran's migraines are at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his service.
