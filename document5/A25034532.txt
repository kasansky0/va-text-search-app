CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder have been met.?38 U.S.C. § 5108;?38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d), 3.2501(a)(1). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION 

The Veteran had active duty for training service in the United States Army from July 1975 to November 1975.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2022 and constitutes a Higher-Level Review of a supplemental claim decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In February 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2022 supplement claim rating decision.  In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2022 decision.  

In the May 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 AOJ supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

New and Relevant Evidence? 

In the February 2022 supplemental claim rating decision, which was subject to HLR in the March 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ denied the Veteran's supplemental claim for entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder because it determined that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted since the September 2021 supplemental claim decision denying the claim on the merits. The March 2022 HLR supplemental claim decision did not specifically address whether new and relevant evidence had been received since the prior September 2021 denial on the merits.   Therefore, the Board must first determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 supplemental claim decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.? 

By way of background, the AOJ received the Veteran's initial claim seeking entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder in May 2018.  By the time of the February 2020 rating decision, the evidence of record included the following: the Veteran's application; statements of the Veteran received May 2018, June 2019, and February 2020; lay statements of witnesses submitted by the Veteran received in June 2019 and February 2020; VA correspondence sent to the Veteran in June, August, and November 2019; Report of Separation and Record of Service received February 4, 2020; private treatment records from C.A.I. Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute with date of service (DOS) November 18, 2016; and VA Medical Center (VAMC) treatment records from July 2005 through July 2019.? In the February 2020 initial rating decision, the AOJ determined that, while the Veteran had a current disability diagnosed as chronic chest pain, this disability neither occurred in nor was caused by active service.   

Following the February 2020 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, to readjudicate his claim for entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder, claimed as heart dysregulation/atrial fibrillation, in July 2020. In a September 2020 rating decision, the AOJ identified evidence received since the issuance of the prior rating decision as including updated private treatment records from the C.A.I. Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute with DOS July 15, 2020, and a July 2020 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire from a VA examiner; however the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim because it determined that, while the Veteran had a current disability diagnosed as chronic chest pain, this disability neither occurred in nor was caused by active service.

The Veteran next filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, seeking entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder in July 2021. which was denied by rating decision issued in September 2021.  In the September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ considered additional evidence received since the prior denial, a statement from the Veteran received on July 29, 2021, as well as service department records and a Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD 214), however the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim because it determined that, while the Veteran had a current disability diagnosed as chronic chest pain, this disability neither occurred in nor was caused by active service.

The Veteran next filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, seeking service connection for a heart disorder in October 2021, which was denied by rating decision dated the same month on the basis the evidence received since the prior denial, which included private treatment records from the Chandler Regional Medical Center (CRMC) DOS January through March 2021, did not show a heart disorder which either occurred in or was caused by active service. October 2021 Rating Decision. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, most recently in January 2022.  In a February 2022 rating decision, the AOJ considered updated VAMC treatment records and determined this evidence was not relevant in that it did not prove or disprove a matter at issue.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of a February 2022 rating decision.  In the March 2022 HLR rating decision on appeal, the AOJ did not specifically address whether new and relevant evidence had been received since the prior denial under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; however, the AOJ overturned its prior favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a disability (chronic chest pain), and confirmed the prior denial of entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder, as the evidence did not show a condition which was either occurred in or was caused by active service.

In order for VA to readjudicate a previously denied claim, there must be "new and relevant" evidence. Specifically, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured, the Secretary shall readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. 38 U.S.C. § 5108 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.156. The AMA defines "new evidence" as "evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators" and "relevant evidence" as "information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).

Notably, the March 2022 HLR rating decision on appeal overturned the prior favorable finding that the Veteran had been diagnosed with a current heart disability, which in turn means that whether the Veteran has a current heart disability for VA purposes is now at issue in this claim.   Moreover, since the last decision which specifically denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a heart disorder on the merits in September 2021, the Veteran submitted private treatment records from CRMC, DOS January 2021 through March 2021, which noted a past medical history of heart disease, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, with evidence of enlarged heart on chest x-ray, and differential diagnoses including unstable angina, atypical chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.  Thus, the Board finds that the CRMC records constitute new and relevant evidence since the prior September 2021 denial and readjudication of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder is warranted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for a heart disorder.

The Board has found readjudication of the claim is warranted based on the receipt of new and relevant evidence. Moreover, the Veteran has a procedural right to have one review of his appeal by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); see also Hickson v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 394, 399 (2010). The AOJ has not yet adjudicated the claim based on the merits, to include the new and relevant evidence. The Board is unaware of any legal authority to support the idea that Hickson does not apply to the AMA because Hickson was based on 38 U.S.C. § 7104, which was not amended by the AMA. Thus, a remand for readjudication on the merits is necessary as the Veteran has a procedural right to have one review of his appeal by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a), and the AMA amendments do not specifically revoke that right. 

The Board also observes in this case that remand is required to address pre-decisional duty to assist errors. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a) ("[t]he Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim"). 

The Veteran contends he suffered an episode of heart failure during his active duty for training (AIT) while stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana in 1975.  July 2021 VA Form 21-4138.  He explained that he was admitted to the base hospital for three days of observation as a result of this episode.  Id.; February 2020 VA Form 21-0781.  The Veteran described onset of shortness of breath with malaise during the last week of AIT, which precipitated his admission to the base hospital for observation and tests, followed by his discharge from service.  July 2020 Medical Opinion DBQ.

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted private treatment records from C.A.I. Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, which documented diagnoses of hypertension, abnormal EKG, and chest pain, for which a stress test, echocardiogram and follow up appointments with Dr. H.S. were planned; as well as the CRMC, which noted a past medical history of heart disease, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, systolic heart failure, with evidence of enlarged heart on chest x-ray, and differential diagnoses including unstable angina, atypical chest pain, dyspnea, and congestive heart failure.  The VAMC records document a diagnosis of hypertension as early as January 2011. VA treatment records received January 23, 2020, DOS January 26, 20211.

The evidence of record also contains the medical opinion of a July 2020 VA examiner, which notes the absence of service treatment records (STRs) and limited private treatment records submitted by the Veteran in support of his claim.  Id.  In light of the absence of STRs and limited private treatment records, as well as the fact that a lay Veteran could not "self-diagnosis" a heart disorder, the examiner opined that there was "no objective medical data of record to support any contention that the Veteran has, or has had, a pathologic cardiac condition."  Importantly, this examiner indicated that "if and when" the missing private treatment records were submitted, he would be "happy to complete an addendum to this opinion." 

Once the VA provides a veteran with an examination in a service connection claim, the examination must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). For a medical opinion to be adequate, it must be: (1) based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) be the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) be the result of principles and methods reliably applied to the facts. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302 (2008).  

The Board finds the July 2020 medical opinion inadequate, as the VA examiner clearly documented an inability to render a diagnosis in the Veteran's claim based on a lack of STRs.  Moreover, the examiner did not discuss the 2011 diagnosis of hypertension in the VAMC records. Consequently, the AOJ's failure obtain an adequate opinion to determine the nature and etiology of any heart disorder, is a pre-decisional duty to assist error which must be remedied on remand. 

Finally, the Board notes that while the private treatment records from C.A.I. Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute from November 2016 and July 2020, and CRMC records from January 2021 through March 2021, have been submitted by the Veteran in support of his claim.  However, based on the July 2020 examiner's statement, the Board acknowledges that there appear to be outstanding private treatment records.  VA's duty to assist includes making reasonable efforts to obtain relevant private medical records. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(1) (emphasis added).  Here, the AOJ requested the Veteran provide any additional records related to his claim in correspondence sent to the Veteran on January 10, 2022.  When the Veteran did not respond within 30 days, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim. The Board also notes that an October 2021 rating decision informed the Veteran that the July 2020 examiner noted the missing private treatment records and advised the Veteran to submit them so that the July 2020 examiner could review them to reconsider his opinion.  Therefore, the Board finds the AOJ has fulfilled its duty to assist the Veteran as required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c).  However, on remand, the Veteran is strongly encouraged to submit any additional private treatment records related to his claim, to include any outstanding records from C.A.I. Cardiac Arrhythmia Institute, Dr. H.S., and the Chandler Regional Medical Center, or submit a VA Forms 21-4142 and 21-4142a if he requests the AOJ's assistance in obtaining these records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Forward the claims file and a copy of this Remand to the July 2020 medical examiner for completion of an addendum medical opinion to determine the nature and etiology any heart disorder. If the previous VA examiner is unavailable, an equally qualified VA examiner may be substituted.  If the examiner determines that a new examination is necessary to provide the requested opinions, such examination should be scheduled. The examiner must address the following:

(a.) Identify any heart disorders since the Veteran's May 2018 initial claim (even if now resolved).

(b.) For each diagnosis, the examiner is asked to opine whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e., the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any current heart disorder identified above was either incurred in service or is otherwise related to service, to include the Veteran's lay statements regarding experiencing "heart failure" in service, with onset of shortness of breath and malaise, followed by a hospitalization at Fort Polk for observation and testing, with a diagnosis of a "bad heart."

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions rendered.
