ISSUE

Entitlement to service connection for a bunion condition, right (right big toe disability).

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right big toe disability is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1980 to May 1982.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).   

As background, following an October 2017 VA Form 526EZ claiming, inter alia, entitlement to service connection for a bilateral big toe disability, and a January 2018 rating decision, the Veteran filed a January 2021 supplemental claim. Following a February 2021 rating decision, the Veteran timely filed a May 2021 VA Form 10182, and selected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held in October 2024 with the undersigned Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 supplemental claim rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the October 2024 Board hearing or within 90 days following the Board hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) after the February 2021 rating decision and prior to the October 2024 Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the October 2024 Board hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for a right big toe disability. 

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for a right big toe disability. Specifically, he claims that the disability was incurred in-service, or in the alternative, was caused by, due to, or aggravated by his service-connected right foot disability. See October 2024 Board hearing.

As an initial matter, the Veteran has been diagnosed over time with (and without) right foot hallux valgus (bunion), degenerative joint disease 1st metatarsophalangeal joint, hallux rigidus, hallux limitus, and degenerative arthritis. The Board has broadened and recharacterized the issue on appeal to entitlement to service connection for a right big toe disability. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).

Additionally, the Board notes that in the February 2021 supplemental claim rating decision, the RO found new and relevant evidence had been received. The Board is bound by this prior favorable finding, which was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 3.2501. 

The Board also notes that the Veteran is service-connected for a right foot 5th metatarsal disability with an effective date of January 24, 1990. Additionally, the RO found that the Veteran was diagnosed with a right big toe disability (hallux rigidus and degenerative arthritis). The Board is also bound by this favorable finding, which was not clearly and unmistakably erroneous. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

To that end, the Board notes that the Veteran has had several VA examinations regarding entitlement to service connection for a right big toe disability.  

In both an October 2007 and February 2020 VA examination, the examiners opined that the Veteran's right big toe disability was not caused by or related to his service-connected right foot 5th metatarsal disability. In a January 2018 VA examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's right big toe disability was not incurred in or caused by injury during service.

The Board finds the above examinations inadequate for adjudication purposes specifically because in no instance was an aggravation opinion provided as it related to the Veteran's service-connected right foot 5th metatarsal disability. El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-141 (2013). 

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct the above pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain a VA medical examination/opinion which specifically addresses the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right big toe disability encompassing alternative theories of entitlement as appropriate.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA examination from an appropriate medical professional regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right big toe disability. The electronic claims folder, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to the examiner. The examiner is requested to provide an opinion on the following:

(a) Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's right big toe disability was caused by or due to, or aggravated* by the Veteran's service-connected right foot disability.

*Any amount of aggravation is sufficient to establish secondary service connection; permanent aggravation/worsening of a non- service-connected disability is not required. See Ward & Neal v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233 (2019).

A complete and thorough rationale, with citation to relevant evidence and specific medical studies as appropriate must be provided for any opinion.

As to the rendered opinion, the examiner should also specifically discuss lay statements made by the Veteran in connection with his disability as appropriate, as well as any contradictory evidence in the claims file, and reconcile that evidence with their findings.
