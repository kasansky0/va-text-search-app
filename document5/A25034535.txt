ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for a migraine headache disorder prior to March 5, 2020, is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating of 50 percent, but no higher, from March 5, 2020, for a migraine headache disorder is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of March 5, 2020, for the award of basic eligibility to dependents' educational assistance (DEA) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to March 5, 2020, the Veteran's headaches did not manifest as characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over last several months.

2. Affording reasonable doubt to the Veteran, as of March 5, 2020, it was factually ascertainable his migraine headache disorder manifested as migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

3. As of March 5, 2020, the Veteran had a permanent and total rating.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for a migraine headache disorder prior to March 5, 2020, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

2. The criteria for a 50 percent disability rating, but no higher, for a migraine headache disorder from March 5, 2020, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

3. As of March 5, 2020, the criteria for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits under Chapter 35 are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3510, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R.       §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1979 to November 1982 and from August 1988 to May 1995.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the September 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Lastly, the Board must address an initial matter. In the May 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the AOJ proposed new effective dates for the award of a 50 percent disability rating and entitlement to DEA benefits based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE). In response to this proposal, in June 2023, the Veteran's representative claimed the proposed dates represented CUE and requested a hearing to address the error. As to the CUE claim, the January 19, 2024, rating decision on appeal did not implement the proposed dates. Thus, since the proposed effective dates were not implemented, the CUE claim is now superfluous. 

INCREASED RATING

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based, as far as can practically be determined, on the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Each service-connected disability is rated on the basis of specific criteria identified by Diagnostic Codes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. When rating the Veteran's service-connected disability, the entire medical history must be borne in mind. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Separate higher or lower compensable evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time if such distinct periods are shown by the competent evidence of record during the appeal, a practice known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

The Veteran's migraine headache disorder is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100 which provides a 10 percent rating for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months; a 30 percent rating with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months; a 50 percent rating with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

"'Prostrating' means 'lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise laid low.'" Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018) (citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1822 (1966)). The phrase 'characteristic prostrating attacks' plainly describes migraine attacks that typically produce powerlessness or a lack of vitality." Johnson, at 252. Moreover, "[t]he modifier "completely," as used before "prostrating" in the 50 percent criteria, means that the veteran must be rendered entirely powerless and... "productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability." Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 70 (2020) citing Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018); Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446 (2004).

Moreover, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has held that DC 8100 contemplates more than just headache symptoms and requires that VA consider all the symptoms the veteran experiences as a result of migraine attacks, and then rate those symptoms based on the frequency, duration, severity, and economic impact of the attacks. Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 73 (2020). Thus, symptoms other than headaches, such as various non-headache symptoms like dizziness, nausea, vertigo, mood swings, sleep impairment, etc., are adequately contemplated by the migraine headache rating criteria under DC 8100. Id.

The Court has held that the rating criteria under DC 8100 are successive, and therefore require that a veteran rated at a higher level must satisfy all the requirements of the lower levels. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253-254 (2018). As such, §§ 4.7 and 4.21 do not apply to this regulation. Id. However, § 4.3 concerning the resolution of reasonable doubt does apply. Id. at 254.

Increased rating for migraine headaches 

The Veteran seeks entitlement to a compensable disability rating for his migraine headache disorder prior to May 31, 2022. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The Board notes, since he has continually pursued his initial disability rating, the period on appeal begins January 8, 2016, the effective date for the grant of service connection.

Turning to the evidence of record, in January 2017, the Veteran underwent a VA Headache examination. The Veteran subjectively reported he had no work limitations due to headaches. He experienced pain that typically lasted more than two days on both sides of his head. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not experience any other symptoms and that he did not experience prostrating attacks.

During the Veteran's March 5, 2020, Board hearing, he contended that when he experienced a migraine when working, he attempted to "work through them" but at home he goes "straight up to my room...  I close the blinds to make it dark... Then I just lay down."

A May 2020 VA examination was conducted based only upon the evidence of record and not an in-person or telephone interview. The examiner determined the Veteran experienced the exact same symptoms as the January 2017 VA examination.

A June 2020 AOJ rating decision awarded service connection for migraine headaches and assigned a non-compensable rating effective January 8, 2016. 

The Veteran underwent an April 2021 VA examination which he subjectively reported when working he "can't focus or concentrate to drive [and has to] switch roles" and that at their worst, his headaches cause blurry vision, he "can't focus or concentrate," and can feel like he was "hit in my head with a sledgehammer." Ultimately, the examiner similarly determined he did not experience prostrating attacks.

In May 2022, the Veteran submitted a detailed list of the days he experienced headaches since September 2021 and included a description of symptoms, including that he must lay down in the dark when most headaches occur. 

In June 2022, the Veteran underwent another VA headaches examination and subjectively reported he has migraines every day, he is sensitive to light and sounds, has intermittent nausea, experiences difficulties with his vision, and takes 800mg of ibuprofen. The report determined he experienced constant pain on both sides of his head which worsens with physical activity and has pulsating or throbbing head pain. The report also noted he experienced the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, and changes in vision. The report noted his headaches are daily or constant. Lastly, the examiner determined he experienced very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines but did not indicate the frequency of such attacks. The following functional impact was noted, "excruciating pain daily, which causes stress because he is afraid of losing his job which makes pain worse. Is a sanitation worker and it affects how quickly [he] can do [a] job. Feels at risk when he gets visual changes, concerned he may hurt himself."

The Board notes that VA treatment records document routine treatment for migraine headaches and do not contain any evidence relevant to the rating criteria. 

After a review of the claims file in conjunction with the applicable laws and regulations, the Board finds the weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's migraine headache disorder warrants a compensable disability rating from prior to March 5, 2020. However, the Board finds that granting reasonable doubt to the Veteran, his migraine headache disorder warrants a 50 percent rating, but no higher, from March 5, 2020. 

As to his migraine headaches prior to March 5, 2020, the evidence of record is devoid of any indication his migraines manifested at a compensable level. Specifically, at no point during this period does the evidence of record, including the 2017 VA examination, show the Veteran report his headaches manifested as characteristically prostrating or produced powerlessness or a lack of vitality. He also reported he had no work limitations due to headaches. Indeed, although the VA treatment records reflect various complaints of migraines, at no point does the Veteran report his headaches manifest as the symptoms contemplated by a compensable rating.

In that regard, the Board acknowledges the April 2020 Board decision determined the January 2017 VA examination was inadequate, however, the inadequacies were only in relation to the nexus element of the claim of service connection and not the adequacy of rating the Veteran's headaches. Indeed, the Veteran at no point has alleged the examiner misstated the severity of his headache disorder. Accordingly, the Board finds the examination still provides probative value as to the severity of his headache disorder at the time of examination.

The first indication in the evidence of record the Veteran's headache disability worsened is March 5, 2020. Specifically, during his Board hearing he alleged his headaches caused him to lay down in the dark. While the Board recognizes the subsequent May 2020 VA examination determined he did not experience prostrating attacks, the examination did not include an in-person interview and was based solely on the absence of documented treatment in the VA records. Thus, the ultimate conclusions of the May 2020 VA examiner provided limited probative value. Moreover, during the April 2021 VA examination, the Veteran indicated when working he "can't focus or concentrate to drive [and has to] switch roles" and that at their worst, his headaches cause blurry vision, he "can't focus or concentrate," and can feel like he was "hit in my head with a sledgehammer." Despite this evidence, the examiner determined he did not experience prostrating attacks. However, the Board finds the Veteran's statements at the April 2021 VA examination are consistent with the features of a migraine manifesting as completely prostrating or powerlessness. Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran's lay statements competent and credible in regard to his migraine headache symptoms as they are readily observable symptoms. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

Indeed, the symptoms described in the March 5, 2020, Board hearing were buttressed by the Veteran's May 2022 statement which documented the severity and frequency of his symptoms since at least September 2021. Moreover, these symptoms were confirmed in the June 2022 VA examination which determined he now experienced a multitude of symptoms and very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines. Considering the above evidence, the Board finds that his migraine headache disorder worsened as of March 5, 2020, and that his symptoms are more commensurate with the criteria contemplated by a 50 percent disability rating from that time.

In sum, the Board finds the weight of the evidence is against finding the Veteran's migraine headache disorder warrants a compensable disability rating prior to March 5, 2020; however, the Board finds a 50 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for his migraine headache disorder from March 5, 2020, the date of the Board hearing and the first time the evidence of record indicates such manifestations are present. To the extent any higher or separate ratings are sought during either period, as the evidence is persuasively against the claims, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply to either claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (2021).

DEA Benefits

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for DEA benefit eligibility.

The Board notes the current DEA effective date is predicated on the effective date for a 100 percent total rating. To be found permanently and totally disabled, so as to apply for Chapter 35 benefits, the rating must be total, or 100 percent.

For purposes of eligibility to DEA benefits under Chapter 35, the child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

In this case, in a September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ found the Veteran was eligible for DEA benefits under Chapter 35, effective May 31, 2022. That is the same effective date as the Veteran being assigned a 50 percent rating for a migraine headache disorder, and thus a 100 percent total rating. However, considering the earlier effective date awarded above for the migraine headache disorder, the date the Veteran will be rated as 100 percent disabled is as of March 5, 2020.

The criterion for educational benefits provides that for effective dates assigned following the grant of benefits under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to the effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In light of the Board's decision, the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits. As a total rating has been assigned as of March 5, 2020, that is the earliest eligibility for DEA benefits. Prior to March 5, 2020, the Veteran was not assigned a total disability rating. The Board notes the Veteran was previously in receipt of a 100 percent total rating; however, that was due to convalescence after a surgical procedure and thus he was not permanently and totally disabled.
