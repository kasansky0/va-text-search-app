ORDER

New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for left middle finger joint problems.

New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection linear scar distal to left knee s/p stitches from laceration (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin).

New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection claim for lower back pain.

New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for paresthesia to left lower extremity (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin).

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's service connection claims pertaining to the left middle finger joint, a left knee scar, low back pain, and paresthesia to the left lower extremity were previously denied in an October 2023 rating decision, largely due to a lack of nexus; the decision was not appealed, but instead the Veteran filed a supplemental claim, which was denied in a March 2024 rating decision for lack of new and relevant evidence.

2. Evidence added to the claims file since the previous October 2023 rating decision denying the Veteran's claim were merely copies of evidence already contained in the record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision or duplicative contentions.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for left middle finger joint problems have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (35), 5108.

2. The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for linear scar distal to left knee s/p stitches from laceration (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (35), 5108.

3. The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for lower back pain have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (35), 5108.

4. The criteria for readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection for paresthesia to left lower extremity (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (35), 5108.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from April 1979 to April 1983.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

1. New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for left middle finger joint problems.

2. New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection linear scar distal to left knee s/p stitches from laceration (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin).

3. New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection claim for lower back pain.

4. New and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim for entitlement to service connection for paresthesia to left lower extremity (claimed as scaring, numbing in left shin).

If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim, the Secretary shall readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  38 U.S.C. § 5108.  New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers.  Relevant evidence means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (35).

Here, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for a low back condition in January 2022 and subsequently filed additional service connection claims for left middle finger joint problems and for left shin scarring and numbing in February 2022.  The Veteran contended his low back condition was related to loading 500-pound bombs while on active duty and that his left middle finger and left shin injuries were related to accidents while stationed at Camp Lejeune in 1983 where he was seen in a hospital.  The Veteran's claims were denied in a May 2022 rating decision.  

The Veteran thereafter filed a May 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), and the AOJ found duty to assist errors for both failing to develop for the Veteran's service treatment records and obtaining relevant medical examinations and opinions.  June 2022 HLR Decision.  After undertaking additional development, the Veteran's claims were again denied in an October 2022 rating decision.  The AOJ also issued an October 2022 Final Attempt Letter indicating that the Veteran's requested service records could not be found and that further attempts to obtain the records would be futile.  The Veteran thereafter filed a November 2022 HLR, and the AOJ again found a duty to assist error for failing to properly develop for treatment records at the Naval Hospital at Camp Lejeune.  February 2023 HLR Decision.  The AOJ thereafter undertook additional development and issued another Final Attempt Letter in August 2023 indicating the Veteran's service treatment records could not be located and all efforts to obtain the information had been exhausted.  The Veteran also provided both an August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim indicating that he did not have service treatment records and a November 2022 letter from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) that medical records are with VA.  The Veteran's claims were again denied in an October 2023 rating decision.  

At the time of the October 2023 rating decision, the record included the Veteran's lay statements, the Veteran's service personnel records, documentation of attempts to obtain the Veteran's service treatment records, and post service VA treatment records from August 2008 to April 2011.  The record additionally included VA examinations confirming the Veteran's diagnoses of joint stiffness, lumbosacral strain, linear scar distal to left knee s/p stitches from laceration, and paresthesia to left lower extremity.  Associated VA medical opinions rendering negative nexus opinions regarding each of the Veteran's claims were also of record. 

Rather than seeking appellate review of the October 2023 decision, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in October 2023 for service connection for left middle finger joint problem, linear scar distal to left knee, lower back pain, and paresthesia left lower extremity.  The AOJ issued a new rating decision in March 2024 denying readjudication of the Veteran's claims on the basis that new and relevant evidence had not been submitted.

The only evidence added to the record subsequent to the October 2023 rating decision are a copy of the Veteran's August 2023 Statement in Support of Claim, a copy of the November 2022 letter from the National Personnel Records Center, and a summary of the Veteran's post service VA medical treatment records from August 2008 to April 2011.  This evidence is duplicative to the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision and, therefore, does not constitute new and relevant evidence.  

Accordingly, while the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran, the Board is constrained to deny the Veteran's appeal as new and relevant evidence has not been received sufficient to readjudicate the claim.  The Board also acknowledges the argument contained within the August 2024 Appellate Brief submitted on the Veteran's behalf and notes that the instant decision does not bar the Veteran from filing a new supplemental claim accompanied by new and relevant evidence in support of his claims.
