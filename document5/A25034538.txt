REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2020 to April 2023.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2024, January 2024, November 2023, and October 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) rating decisions.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, for the claims remanded herein, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Under the relevant laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.?38 U.S.C. § 1110. Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67?(Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Under?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), an alternative method of establishing the second and third Shedden elements is through a demonstration of continuity of symptomatology if the disability claimed qualifies as a chronic disease listed in?38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Service connection is also available for chronic disabilities diagnosed within one year of separation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3).

Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for a disability diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability is due to disease or injury which was incurred in or aggravated by service.?38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus 

At the October 2023 VA examination (which occurred within one year of separation), the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus and described it as "intermittent."  The examiner provided a negative etiological opinion.  However, the Board need not detail this nexus opinion because § 3.307(a)(2) and § 3.309(a) permit presumptive service connection for tinnitus if diagnosed within a year of service separation.  

Here, the Board grants presumptive service connection under §§ 3.307(a)(2) and 3.309(a) as the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus within one year of separation.  No further discussion is necessary.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD

At an October 2023 VA examination (which occurred within one year of separation), the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The examiner stated that this disability was "very likely...secondary to high functioning autism."  The examiner also explained that the Veteran had "generalized anxiety about being away from home and in new environment."  The Veteran's lay statements corroborate this notion that he was "lonely" and "worried about being away from home" while on board the USS Blue Ridge.

September 2023 CAPRI records show that the Veteran "has had symptoms of PTSD since service."  November 2023 CAPRI records show treatment for depression and anxiety "since he was a child."  Therein, the Veteran reported that service was "bad, I didn't like it at all, I was super expendable, I didn't feel like I had a place there at all, I brought it up and it was brushed off...felt very isolated and alienated."

In a January 2024 medical opinion, the VA examiner stated that the Veteran "reported he was lonely at times during his military service, which is normal."  The examiner added that "being stressed in the military...is normal."  The examiner concluded that his current mental health disability is at least as likely as not related to current life stressors including living with his mother, "feeling like a child again," and being underemployed at Home Depot.  The examiner clarified that the Veteran has not been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and is presumed sound upon entry into service.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for a psychiatric disability.  First, the Veteran is presumed sound upon entry regarding a psychiatric diagnosis into service per 38 U.S.C. § 1111 based upon available service treatment records.  Further, the evidence shows that he was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood within a year of service separation and that it is related to "being away from home and in new environment."  While meant in a negative context, the examiner's statements that being lonely in the military is "normal" actually weighs in favor of the claim given 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a)'s direction to consider the types and circumstances of service.  The Veteran's lay statements and CAPRI records showing stress and loneliness related to his service on board the USS Blue Ridge also weigh in favor of the claim.

While the Board could remand for a clarification opinion, the evidence is nearly equal as to whether the Veteran's psychiatric disability is related to service.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  See also Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305 (2003) (holding that the Board is prohibited from developing additional evidence for the purpose of obtaining evidence against a claimant's case).  The nature and extent of this disability is not before the Board at this time.

3. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD, joint pains, bilateral hearing loss, and an eye disability

The threshold question is whether the Veteran is currently diagnosed with PTSD, joint pains, bilateral hearing loss, and an eye disability. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992); 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).  The Board will take each disability in turn for ease of discussion.

PTSD

Service connection for PTSD specifically requires medical evidence establishing a diagnosis of the disability, credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred, and a link, established by medical evidence, between the current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran believes he has PTSD related to a fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.  However, at an October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD as his symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria under DSM-5 criteria.  Rather, and as stated above, the examiner stated that the Veteran had "generalized anxiety about being away from home and in new environment."  The military records available show that the Veteran did not engage in combat, experience hostile military or terrorist activity or an in-service personal assault as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(2)-(3), (5).  The Board acknowledges the September 2023 CAPRI record showing that he "has had symptoms of PTSD since service," but this statement is discounted based on the lack of confirmed in-service qualifying stressor.  See December 1, 2023, Records Research Center Response.

While the Veteran believes he has a current diagnosis of PTSD, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence failing to show a diagnosis of PTSD.

Because there is no evidence of currently diagnosed PTSD, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply; the appeal in this matter must be denied.  The post-decisional submission of service treatment records is not considered a duty to assist error in these circumstances as the Veteran is not currently diagnosed with PTSD; these records cannot substantiate this missing element.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and 38 C.F.R. § 21.1032 (limiting the duty to assist in obtaining relevant federal records).

Importantly, this issue is generally considered separate from whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection for a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD given the difference in documented and alleged diagnoses.  That claim has been granted in section two above.  However, the Board reminds the Veteran that when it is not possible to separate the effects of a service-connected condition from a non-service-connected condition (in this case a psychiatric disability generally and PTSD), reasonable doubt should be resolved in the Veteran's favor with regard to the question of whether certain signs and symptoms can be attributed to the service-connected disability.  Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181, 182 (1998).

Joint Pains

The Veteran contends that his joint pains as due to "moving around heavy objects and the enclosed spaces took a toll on my joints."

VA attempted to contact the Veteran in December 2023 in order to clarify which joints he is claiming compensation for; the Veteran did not answer.  

After review of the claims file, there are no post-service medical treatment records showing any treatment to the joints.  Indeed, November 2023 CAPRI records show that the Veteran "did not report pain as a concern today."

Based on the above, service connection for joint pains must be denied.  First, the Board finds this claim to be ambiguous as to what compensation the Veteran is specifically seeking.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (defining claims as requesting determination of entitlement "to a specific benefit.").  To that end, the Veteran did not respond to VA's calls when it attempted to clarify what "specific" benefit the Veteran was seeking.  The duty to assist is not a one-way street. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).  The Veteran's inability to respond to VA's contact frustrates the Board ability to review this claim.  Third, a review of the post-service medical evidence fails to show treatment or an indication of joint pains.

Because there is no evidence of currently diagnosed joint pains, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). Accordingly, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply; the appeal in this matter must be denied.  The post-decisional submission of service treatment records is not considered a duty to assist error in these circumstances as the Veteran is not currently diagnosed with joint pains, the claim itself is ambiguous, and the Veteran did not attempt to clarify what "specific" benefit he was seeking; these records cannot substantiate this missing element.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and 38 C.F.R. § 21.1032 (limiting the duty to assist in obtaining relevant federal records).

Bilateral Hearing Loss

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of those frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. It has been established that 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service if there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a medical relationship between the Veteran's in-service exposure to loud noise and current disability. See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). The Board notes that the directives in Hensley are consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

An October 2023 VA audiological examination shows auditory thresholds as follows:

500 Hz 	1000 Hz 	2000 Hz 	3000 Hz 	4000 Hz

Left 		5 		10 		5 		5		10

Right 		15 		10		20		20		20

Speech discrimination scores were 100 percent in the left and right ear.

As shown above, the October 2023 VA examination did not show hearing loss for VA purposes in either ear based upon puretone thresholds, and the speech discrimination scores.

The Board notes that the Veteran was exposed to hazardous military noise while in service and "reports he sometimes has difficulty hearing conversation." However, even considering this information, in the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection. Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 178-80 (2007). The most persuasive objective evidence shows that the Veteran is not diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss at any point during the appellate period or close in time to the appeal period.

The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report a history of in-service noise exposure, and such exposure is conceded. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). However, a review of the record shows no diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. Bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes is not a simple medical condition capable of lay observation or diagnosis, and the Veteran is not shown to be qualified through specialized education, training, or experience to diagnose a hearing loss disability. The Board gives probative weight to the October 2023 VA audiological testing results as it is based on the VA-specific audiological criteria. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

In the absence of any persuasive and probative evidence that the Veteran has bilateral hearing loss, service connection is not warranted, and the claim must be denied. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  The post-decisional submission of service treatment records is not considered a duty to assist error in these circumstances as the Veteran is not currently diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss; these records cannot substantiate this missing element.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and 38 C.F.R. § 21.1032 (limiting the duty to assist in obtaining relevant federal records).

Eye Disability

The Veteran states that "I always wore glasses before I joined the Navy. My glasses broke while working around dangerous machinery and I have had a few occasions where hazardous materials got in my eye."

At an October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported "declining distance vision over the last few years," however, the examiner noted that he does not wear any vision correction and has not had any ocular injuries or surgeries.  The examiner failed to diagnose the Veteran with an eye disability because he only has refractive error.

"Congress specifically limits entitlement to service-connected disease or injury where such cases have resulted in a disability... in the absence of a proof of present disability there can be no claim." Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The medical evidence does not show a current eye disease or injury. As a result, the compensation claim must be denied as there is no pathology for which compensation can be awarded. The Veteran does not have any relevant eye disorder for which compensation may awarded. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms that he believes to be consistent with such a disorder, however, there is no objective medical evidence of an underlying eye disorder.

With respect to the Veteran's refractive error, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c), refractive error of the eye is not considered a disease or injury within the meaning of applicable legislation governing the awards of compensation benefits. See McNeely v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 357 (1992); Parker v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 522 (1991).

While service connection may be granted, in limited circumstances, for superimposed disability on a constitutional or developmental abnormality (see VAOPGCPREC 82-90, 55 Fed. Reg. 45,711 (1990); see also Carpenter v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 240 (1995); Monroe v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 513 (1993)), there is no evidence whatsoever that such occurred in this case. Even taking as true the Veteran's allegation that, "glasses broke while working around dangerous machinery and I have had a few occasions where hazardous materials got in my eyes," the evidence does not reflect aggravation or a superimposed disability. Regardless, refractive error stands as a separate condition from defects. Refractive error may become worse, but it remains refractive error and is not a disease or injury.

As a result, service connection is not warranted for an eye disability, as there is no evidence of an eye disorder for which service connection may be granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c).  The post-decisional submission of service treatment records is not considered a duty to assist error in these circumstances as the Veteran is not currently diagnosed with an eye disability; these records cannot substantiate this missing element.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A and 38 C.F.R. § 21.1032 (limiting the duty to assist in obtaining relevant federal records).

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule),?38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.?Id.?After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.?38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski,?1?Vet. App.?49?(1990). 

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of his symptoms. Layno v. Brown,?6?Vet. App.?465, 470?(1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for vertigo

Peripheral vestibular disorders are rated under DC 6204 which provides for a 10 percent rating for occasional dizziness or a 30 percent rating for dizziness and occasional staggering.  Occasional and staggering are not defined by the VA regulation so the Board must afford these terms meaning.  The Merriam Webster dictionary defines the term "occasional" as "sporadic" and "lacking in steadiness or regularity of occurrence."  See Occasional definition, Merriam-Webster.com, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/occasional (last visited March 21, 2025).  Also, the Merriam Webster dictionary defines the term "stagger" as "to move on unsteadily."  See Stagger definition, Merriam-Webster.com, available at https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stagger.  Note 1 to DC 6260 (recurrent tinnitus) provides that a separate evaluation for tinnitus may be combined with an evaluation under diagnostic code 6204, or other diagnostic code, except when tinnitus supports an evaluation under it.

At an October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported dizziness and described it as "a room spinning and feeling like he was going to pass out."  These symptoms occur less than once a month with prolonged standing and walking.  The examiner noted that the Veteran has "temporary difficulty ambulating during episodes, requiring him to sit down." The Romberg test was positive for unsteadiness and tinnitus was not indicated to impact his dizziness.

Based on the above, the medical evidence supports a 30 percent rating under DC 6204.  The evidence contained within the October 2023 VA examination approximates dizziness with occasional staggering given the provided Merriam Webster definitions above and the evidence showing that the Veteran tested positive for unsteadiness and described his symptoms as "a room spinning and feeling like he was going to pass out" occurring with prolonged standing and walking requiring him to sit down.  In other words, the symptoms approximate the definitions provided.  Lastly, it does not appear as though the Veteran's now-service connected tinnitus impacts this disability within the meaning of Note 1.  Accordingly, an initial 30 percent rating for vertigo under DC 6204 is granted.  This is the highest schedular evaluation under DC 6204 and is considered to be a full grant of benefits on appeal.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for flu-like symptoms is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for strep throat is remanded.

Under the AMA, pre-decisional duty to assist errors and correction of statutory or regulatory duties are eligible for remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

Here, there is an ambiguity as to whether the Veteran is diagnosed with a current disability for these claims.  Specifically, the October 2023 VA examiner stated that the Veteran was diagnosed with pharyngitis with an onset in 2022 but that his reported symptoms have resolved.  The Board finds this examination inconsistent; either the Veteran is currently diagnosed with a disability or he is not. Given this inconsistency, the Board must remand for a clarification opinion.  In the event a diagnosed upper respiratory disability is diagnosed, the VA examiner should consider the Veteran's conceded exposure to asbestos.  38 U.S.C. § 1168.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Clarify the Veteran's upper respiratory disability. If the Veteran is currently diagnosed with an upper respiratory disability, opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood?is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) the Veteran's upper respiratory disability onset in service or is otherwise related to service, to include conceded asbestos exposure?  The examiner should consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the 

?

synergistic, combined effect of all of the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs).
