DOCKET NO. 210716-172950
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of July 9, 2009, for the assignment of a 70 percent evaluation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

It is reasonably shown by evidence in the record that from July 9, 2009, (but not earlier) during the period for consideration, the Veteran's symptoms more nearly approximated a 70 percent rating.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of July 9, 2009, for the assignment of the 70 percent disability rating for PTSD with other specified depressive disorder, cocaine dependence, and marijuana dependence, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1969 to December 1971. The Veteran died in March 2023 and the appellant is his wife, who has been properly substituted in this appeal.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In July 2021 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement, requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge. Therefore, the Board will consider only the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

This matter has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

Earlier effective date for a 70 percent rating for PTSD

The appellant seeks an effective date earlier than January 19, 2010, for the assignment of a 70 percent evaluation for PTSD.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim for increase, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Under the legacy appeal provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105(a), an appeal to the Board after an initial AOJ decision must be initiated by a NOD and completed by a Substantive Appeal (VA Form 9 or equivalent) after a SOC is furnished to the claimant. In essence, the following sequence is required: there must be a rating decision by the AOJ, the claimant must express timely disagreement with the decision (a NOD), VA must respond by explaining the basis of the decision to the claimant (a SOC), and finally the claimant, after receiving adequate notice of the basis of the decision, must complete the process by stating his or her argument in a timely-filed Substantive Appeal (VA Form 9 or equivalent). See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 20.200, 20.201, 20.202, 20.302 (2018). Proper completion and filing of a Substantive Appeal are the last actions a claimant needs to take to perfect an appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. Subsequently, certification of issues on appeal to the Board by the AOJ by way of a VA Form 8 (Certification of Appeal) should occur for administrative purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.35.

With regard to finality, under the previous legacy system for claims not subject to the modernized review system, an AOJ decision becomes final unless an NOD is filed or new and material evidence is received within the one-year appeal period. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 20.1103. Stated another way, under the previous legacy system, a "finally adjudicated claim" is a claim that is adjudicated by the VA as either allowed or disallowed when whichever of the following occurs first: (i) the expiration of the one year period in which to file a NOD, pursuant to the provisions of §19.52(a) or §20.502(a) of this chapter, as applicable; or (ii) disposition on appellate review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(d)(1). In other words, a rating action becomes "final" by the expiration of one year after the date of notice of an award or disallowance, or by denial on appellate review, whichever is the earliest. Id. In this regard, the Court has also confirmed an AOJ decision becomes final "only after the period for appeal has run." Jennings v. Mansfield, 509 F.3d. 1362, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In the current appeal, a September 2008 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 50 percent rating. The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) challenging the September 2008 rating decision and that decision thus became final under the legacy appeals system. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1103.

In January 2010 the Veteran filed an informal claim seeking an increased rating for PTSD. Under applicable VA regulations, an increased rating may be awarded up to one year prior to receipt of the claim if the evidence shows an increase in disability was factually ascertainable during that period. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). Thus, the proper period on appeal for an increased rating claim is one year prior to receipt of the claim.

Prior to January 19, 2010, the Veteran's PTSD is rated at 50 percent under Diagnostic Code 9411. Under DC 9411, a 50 percent rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairments of short-and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbance of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id.

A 70 percent evaluation is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

VA treatment records received on April 24, 2014 include a July 2009 record in which the Veteran reported passive thoughts of suicide with no plan. A September 2009 record notes the Veteran reported exacerbation in seeing "shadows" at night.

Under the legacy constructive possession doctrine, evidence is constructively received by VA when it is generated by or submitted to VA and can reasonably be expected to be connected to the appellant's claim; there is no requirement of any actual knowledge of the evidence on the part of the VA adjudicator. Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (2020).

VA treatment records received on April 24, 2014, were generated by VA at the Gainesville VA medical center (VAMC) between September 2008 and July 2011. Accordingly, VA had constructive possession of the VA treatment records within one year of the August 2014 rating decision.

The evidence shows that the Veteran reported suicidal ideation, and experienced visual hallucinations throughout 2009 indicating that the Veteran's PTSD had worsened in severity during the year preceding his January 2010 claim. Here, the evidence shows that on July 9, 2009, the Veteran reported suicidal ideation. Thus, it is factually ascertainable from the record that an increase in severity of his PTSD, to a degree warranting a 70 percent rating, had occurred as of that date.

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date of a 70 percent rating for PTSD, is granted, effective July 9, 2009.
