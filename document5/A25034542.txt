DOCKET NO. 200729-453422
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year of 2020 is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On April 11, 2023, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1982 to October 1997.

The decision on appeal was issued in July 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the July 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  

The Board notes that in the April 2023 withdrawal statement, the Veteran indicated that he wished to withdraw an appeal with docket number 210104-135691 on the issue of entitlement to a higher rating for chronic renal disease, which was rated as 100 percent disabling.  As the Veteran was informed in a May 2024 letter, the Board erroneously docketed a VA Form 10182 received on January 4, 2021.  Accordingly, withdrawal of docket number 210104-135691 is unnecessary as the appeal has already been undocketed due to administrative error.   

Entitlement to a clothing allowance for the year of 2020 is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative.  Id.  In an April 11, 2023, statement, the Veteran indicated that he wished to withdraw all issues currently on appeal, including the appeal of the denial of a clothing allowance.  Therefore, the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
