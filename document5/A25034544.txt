REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2014 to December 2020. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in May 2022 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disorder.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a jaw disorder.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a hemorrhoid disorder.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left foot disorder.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran, or by his authorized representative. Id. A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

In this case, in October 2024, the Veteran submitted a statement signed by the Veteran and identifying the Veteran's name, VA file number, and a clear, explicit written statement that the Veteran wishes to withdraw his case before the Board. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran has withdrawn the instant appeals and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

?

Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed.
