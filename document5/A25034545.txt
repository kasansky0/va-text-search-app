ORDER

From January 3, 2020, entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent disabling for spondylolisthesis of the lumbar spine ("back disability") is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

From January 3, 2020, and considering the Veteran's pain and corresponding functional impairment, including during flare-ups, his back disability manifests as limitation of motion to 30 degrees or less of forward flexion; the weight of the evidence shows that the disability is not manifested by the functional equivalent of ankylosis, including during flare-ups.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

From January 3, 2020, the criteria for an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for a back disability have not been met.  38U.S.C. §§1155, 5107;38C.F.R. §4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5239.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from October 2000 to October 2004. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the July 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran validly opted in to the AMA from the SSOC and elected the Evidence Submission docket.  The Veteran's Legacy appeal was at the Board in May 2018, May 2019, and September 2021.  In the September 2021 Board decision, the issue of increased rating for his back from November 20, 2012, and from January 3, 2020, the date of a post-remand VA examination, were adjudicated.  

An April 2025 Board decision partially vacated its September 2021 Legacy Board decision as to a rating in excess of 40 percent from January 3, 2020, the issue before the Board in this AMA appeal stream.  

Therefore, this matter is now before the Board in this AMA appeal stream.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 SSOC, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the SSOC on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

VA has a duty to consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F. 3rd 1391 (2021).

Back - Rating Criteria

Since July 1996, the rating criteria for the spine have changed three times, on September 23, 2002, September 26, 2003, and February 7, 2021, to address concerns of the Veterans Court.  

VA's General Counsel has held that where a law or regulation changes during the pendency of a claim of entitlement to a higher rating, the Board must first determine whether the revised version is more favorable to the Veteran.  In so doing, it may be necessary for the Board to apply both the old and new versions of the regulation.  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the retroactive reach of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  See VAOPGCPREC 3-2000, 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); DeSousa v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 461, 467 (1997).

Effective September 26, 2003

Effective September 26, 2003, Diagnostic Code 5293 was replaced with the Formular for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  See 68 Fed. Reg. 51454 (Aug. 27, 2003).  The remaining Diagnostic Codes numbered 5285 through 5295 were replaced with the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  See id.

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine for Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243, unless 5243 is evaluated under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Ratings under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine are made with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.  Id.

The General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides a 10 percent disability rating for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour, or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees, or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  Id.  A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Id.  A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  Id.  A 100 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  Id.  

Note (1) to this Formula provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately, under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.

Evaluations for intervertebral disc syndrome are to be performed either under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined under § 4.25.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes, a 10 percent disability rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 2 weeks but less than 4 weeks during the past 12 months.  Id.  A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 4 weeks but less than 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  Id.  A 60 percent disability rating is assigned for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  Id.

Effective February 7, 2021

Effective February 7, 2021, there are no changes to the General Rating Formula for Disease and Injuries of the Spine.  There are also no changes to Diagnostic Codes 5235 through 5241.  

Under the new regulations, Diagnostic Code 5242 is applicable for degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (also, see either Diagnostic Code 5003 or 5010).  38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a).  

Also under the new regulations, Diagnostic Code 5243 is applicable for intervertebral disc syndrome.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71(a).  This code is to be assigned only when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root.  Id.  Diagnostic Code 5242 is to be assigned for all other disc diagnoses.  Id.  

For painful motion with any form of arthritis, the Veteran is entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  The same is true for painful motion in non-arthritis contexts when raised by the claimant or when reasonably raised by the record.  Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2011).

From January 3, 2020, entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent for a back disability.

The Veteran asserts that he is warranted a rating higher than the assigned 40 percent from January 3, 2020.  

In this case, a May 2020 rating decision under Legacy, granted the Veteran an increased rating to 40 percent for his back disability, effective January 3, 2020, the date of a Legacy post Board remand VA examination.  See May 2020 Rating Decision.

The Veteran's back disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 5239.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235 to 5243, spine disorders are to be rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine on the basis of limitation of motion.  

Under these diagnostic codes, a 40 percent rating is assigned when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is 30 degrees or less, or there is favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  

A 50 percent rating is assigned when there is unfavorable ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine only.  Finally, a 100 percent rating is assigned when there is unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 

The General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provides further guidance in rating diseases or injuries of the spine.  In pertinent part, Note (1) provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Note (2) provides that, for VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees.  The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  The normal combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.  The normal ranges of motion for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined range of motion.  See also Plate V.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The Board notes that May 2018 and May 2019 Board decisions remanded the Veteran's back issue for VA examinations.  The Veteran's VA medical examinations prior to the May 2019 Board remand were found to be inadequate for adjudication purposes as they did not comply with addressing the impact of flare-ups on range of motion of the back and testing of pain on both active and passive motion in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing, pursuant to Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011), Sharpv. Shulkin,29 Vet. App. 26(2017), and Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  As such, the Board will not consider the findings in the pre-remand VA examination reports in adjudicating this appeal.

The Veteran underwent a January 2020 VA examination for his back disability.  The examiner reaffirmed the Veteran's lumbar strain with spondylolisthesis, with reported flare-ups that occur daily in the morning with stiffness in getting out of bed and increasing pain through the day with daily activities.  The Veteran reported taking pain medication as needed, completing physical therapy and taking muscle relaxers.  The examiner indicated initial range of motion measurements were noted at 0 to 30 degrees of forward flexion.  There was evidence of pain on weight bearing and tenderness on the thoracic spine and lumbar spine with spasms.  The Veteran was not able to perform repetitive use testing because the pain was too severe to perform three repetitions.  The Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time; however, pain, fatigue, weakness, lack of endurance, and incoordination were found to significantly limit functional ability, and forward flexion was noted to be limited to 30 degrees.  The examination was conducted during a flare-up of the back and the examiner estimated range of motion during flare-ups to be 0 to 35 degrees for forward flexion, significantly limiting functional ability.  The Veteran reported that has muscle spasms and guarding resulting in pain and stiffness.  The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  The Veteran has IVDS of the thoracolumbar spine with an episode of bed rest of at least once a week but less than two weeks during the prior 12 months.  

The Veteran also provided an October 2020 Affidavit in support of his claim.  He testified that he experiences frequent flare-ups due to various physical activities, resulting in severely limited range of motion and increased burning and stinging from the back down to the back of his knees.  See October 2020 Affidavit.  

In an October 2020 letter from Veteran's representative, the Veteran reasserted that he has a history of lumbar spine flare-ups that warrant a 40 percent evaluation.  See October 2020 Third Party Correspondence.  

Because the VA examination notes the Veteran's reports of severe flare-ups, estimate range of motion to be limited to 30 degrees of forward flexion, and acknowledge the Veteran's use of pain medication and significant limitations on functional ability due to his back disability, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 40 percent is not warranted even when considering his report of pain and limited functional ability with flare-ups and nonuse of pain medication.  Importantly, the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine or the entire spine.  Also, the evidence shows that the Veteran's back disability is not productive of functional equivalent of ankylosis during flare-ups.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).  Therefore, a higher rating is not warranted.  

In is important for the Veteran to understand that even if the Board considers what range of motion the Veteran would have in a flare-up, or without medication, this does not provide a basis to find that he has ankylosis of the spine.  The current 40 rating (a significant disability evaluation which will cause the Veteran many problems) takes into consideration of these problems.  If he did not have these problem (as he has cited) there would be no basis for the current disability evaluation. 

Moreover, the Veteran does not contend, and the evidence does not show that his back disability has been manifested by incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks, during the past 12 months.  As such, the approximate weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 40 percent from January 3, 2020.  

Accordingly, from January 3, 2020, entitlement to a rating in excess of 40 percent disabling for a back disability is denied.   

The evidence in this case is not in approximate balance to warrant application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
