FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On February 27, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 to appeal to the Board an October 29, 2023 rating decision, which awarded service connection for left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of flexion.  

2.  Prior to the Veteran's submission of the February 27, 2024 VA Form 10182, on November 30, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the disability evaluations assigned for the Veteran's left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of flexion.

3. The Veteran's submission of the February 27, 2024 VA Form 10182 is not valid for purposes of initiating Board review of the October 29, 2023 rating decision as to the disability evaluations assigned for the Veteran's left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of flexion.

4. The Veteran's migraine headaches are manifested by characteristic prostrating migraine and non-migraine attacks occurring at least once a month over the last several months, but not very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

5. The Veteran's degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS is manifested by pain on motion, with functional loss due to pain upon movement, weakness, fatigability and lack of endurance.  Forward flexion is limited to no worse than 30 degrees, and the Veteran does not have ankylosis or its equivalent during flare-ups.  

6. The Veteran's fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar is manifested by pain on motion, without a gap of more than two inches between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers, with no additional functional loss.  

7. The Veteran's left foot pes planus is productive of extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces, decreased longitudinal arch height of the left foot on weight-bearing, and accentuated pain on manipulation of the left foot.

8. The Veteran's left foot plantar fasciitis is manifested by pain on use.

9. The Veteran's radiculopathy of the right lower extremity is productive of mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

10. The Veteran's radiculopathy of the left lower extremity is productive of mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

11. The Veteran's traumatic arthritis, right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, is productive of moderate limitation of motion, without ankylosis or its equivalent during flares or less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.

12. The Veteran's traumatic arthritis, left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, is productive of moderate limitation of motion, without ankylosis or its equivalent during flares or less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1972 to July 1981 and from September 1981 to October 1996.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In an October 29, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for left hip strain with thigh impairment (rated as 10 percent disabling), left hip strain with limitation of flexion (rated as noncompensable), and left hip strain with limitation of extension (rated as noncompensable), right lower extremity radiculopathy (rated as 10 percent disabling), and left lower extremity radiculopathy (rated as 10 percent disabling).  The Veteran was also awarded an increased, 40 percent disability evaluation for his degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine and an increased, 30 percent disability evaluation for left foot pes planus with plantar fasciitis.  An effective date of April 25, 2023 was assigned for each award of benefits.  The rating decision also denied the Veteran's claims of entitlement to increased disability evaluations for fracture of the left thumb, right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, and left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on November 1, 2023.  

In a December 1, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for migraine headaches; a 10 percent disability evaluation was assigned, effective April 25, 2023.  The AOJ also denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to TDIU.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on December 5, 2023.

The Veteran appealed the October 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions to the Board by filing a February 27, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On March 9, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Accordingly, under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the November 1, 2023 and December 5, 2023 notices of the rating decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.    

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Dismissal

1. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for left hip strain with thigh impairment, currently rated as 10 percent disabling.

2. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for left hip strain with limitation of flexion, currently rated as noncompensable.

3. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for left hip strain with limitation of extension, currently rated as noncompensable.

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors.  38 U.S.C. § 7104.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error in fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).

With respect to the denial of a claim, a claimant may either elect to submit a Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or submit an appeal to the Board, but may not elect multiple review options.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501.  Such concurrent election is specifically prohibited by 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), which states, "[A] claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option."

The Board notes that in the aforementioned October 29, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, awarded the Veteran service connection for left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of flexion.  A 10 percent disability evaluation was assigned for left hip strain with thigh impairment and noncompensable disability evaluations were assigned for left hip strain with limitation of flexion and left hip strain with limitation of extension.  An effective date of April 25, 2023 was assigned for each award of benefits.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran timely appealed these denials by submitting a February 27, 2024 VA Form 10182: Decision Review Request and selecting the Direct Review docket.  

However, on November 30, 2023, prior to the submission of the February 27, 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting AOJ review of the disability evaluations assigned for the Veteran's left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of extension.  

Because only one review of the same issue under the AMA is permitted, the Board finds that the current appeals of the claims of entitlement to increased disability evaluations for left hip strain with thigh impairment, left hip strain with limitation of flexion, and left hip strain with limitation of extension are invalid.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  See also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA regulations requiring veterans to follow certain procedures in filing appeals do not limit the Board's jurisdiction. Rather, the Court described those regulations as "akin to claims-processing rules" that govern the orderly processing of cases but do not implicate jurisdiction. Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333. According to the Court, therefore, VA regulations requiring specific procedure for filing appeals should be treated as "less stringent" claims-processing rules. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the procedural requirements for review were not complied with as the Veteran erroneously pursued to avenues of review at the same time. Thus, the Board finds that the matters must be dismissed due to the procedural defect involving the claims-processing rules.  Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged.  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

In addition, when assessing the severity of a musculoskeletal disability that is rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must also consider the extent that the veteran may have additional functional impairment above and beyond the limitation of motion objectively demonstrated, such as during times when his symptoms are most prevalent ("flare-ups") due to the extent of his pain (and painful motion), weakness, premature or excess fatigability, and incoordination.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-7 (1995); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA must consider whether a higher evaluation is warranted, where the claimant experiences additional functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, to include with repeated use or during flare-ups.  See 38 C.F.R. § § 4.40, 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-7 (1995).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 are to be considered in conjunction with the diagnostic codes predicated on limitation of motion.  See Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7 (1996).  Nevertheless, pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by the VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Moreover, functional impairment must be supported by adequate pathology.  Id.: Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7, 10 (1996) (both citing to 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).

4. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for migraine headaches, currently rated as 10 percent disabling.

The Veteran's migraine headaches are rated as 10 percent disabling pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.  

A noncompensable disability evaluation is for assignment where there are characteristic prostrating attacks less frequent than one every two months.  A 10 percent disability evaluation is assigned for prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  For the next higher 30 percent disability evaluation, there must be characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over the last several months.  For a higher, 50 percent disability evaluation to be warranted, there must be migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Neither the rating criteria nor the Court has defined the term "prostrating."  According to WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH, THIRD COLLEGE EDITION 1080 (1986), "prostration" is defined as "utter physical exhaustion or helplessness."  A very similar definition is found in DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1367 (28th ed. 1994), in which "prostration" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness."  Further, "inadaptability" is also not defined under Diagnostic Code 8100, nor can a definition be found elsewhere in title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  See Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446 (2004).  In addition, it has been held that nothing in diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  Pierce, 18 Vet. App. at 446.  In this regard it was explained by the Court that if "economic inadaptability" were read to import unemployability, the appellant, should he or she meet the economic-inadaptability criterion, would then be eligible for a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability resulting from a service-connected disability (TDIU) rather than just a 50 percent rating.  Id., citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  In the Pierce case, the Court discussed the notion that consideration must also be given as to whether the disability is capable of producing severe economic inadaptability, regardless of whether the condition is actually causing such inadaptability.  See Pierce, 18 Vet. App. at 445-46.  In this regard, the decision mentions that, VA conceded that the words, "productive of" could be read to mean either "producing" or "capable of producing."  Id. at 446-47.

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that, for the rating period on appeal, the Veteran's migraine headaches more closely approximate the criteria for a 30 percent disability evaluation.  In this regard, the Board observes that the August 2023 VA examiner characterized the Veteran's migraine headaches as characteristic prostrating attacks occurring at least once a month.  The Board also observes that the August 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran reported experiencing headaches three to four times per month; the Veteran reported that his headaches last one day.  At the August 2023 VA examination, he reported that he took Tylenol as need for his migraine headaches.  The August 2023 VA examination report also indicates that the Veteran described his migraine headaches as throbbing pain on both sides of his head.  The August 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran reported that his headaches are accompanied by sensitivity to light and sound, with nausea.  The Board notes that August 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's migraine headaches do not impact the Veteran's ability to work and that available treatment records reflect a history of headaches, relieved by Tylenol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.  As such, Board does not find that the Veteran's headaches are productive on severe economic inadaptability. 

Accordingly, entitlement to a 30 percent disability evaluation, but no higher, for migraine headaches is warranted.

5. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS, currently rated as 40 percent disabling.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 40 percent disability rating for his service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.  

Lumbosacral and cervical spine disabilities are rated under the General Rating Formula for Rating Diseases and Injuries of the Spine ("general rating formula").  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-5242.  Intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is rated under the General Rating Formula for Rating Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher rating when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

The Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes provides for ratings from 10 to 60 percent based on the frequency and duration of incapacitating episodes, defined in Note 1 as a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  The maximum 60 percent schedular rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the previous 12 months.  The Board notes that effective February 7, 2021, the spine regulations were amended to state that Diagnostic Code 5243 governing intervertebral disc syndrome should only be assigned when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root, and that Diagnostic Code 5242 should apply to all other disc diagnoses.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76462 (Nov. 30, 2020) (effective 2/7/2021).  

The Notes following the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provide further guidance in rating diseases or injuries of the spine.  Note 1 provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Note 2 provides that, for VA compensation purposes, the combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  The normal combined range of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees and of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.  Note 4 provides that range of motion measurements are to be rounded to the nearest five degrees.  Note 5 defines unfavorable ankylosis as a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Note 6 provides that disability of the thoracolumbar and cervical spine segments are to be rated separately, except when there is unfavorable ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single disability.

According to the general rating formula, a 10 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees, but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent evaluation is to be assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.   A 100 percent evaluation is to be assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5235 for vertebral fracture or dislocation; 5236 for sacroiliac injury and weakness; 5237 for lumbosacral strain; Diagnostic Code 5238 for spinal stenosis; Diagnostic Code 5239 for spondylolisthesis or segmental instability; Diagnostic Code 5240 for ankylosing spondylitis; Diagnostic Code 5241 for spinal fusion; Diagnostic Code 5242 for degenerative arthritis of the spine; and Diagnostic Code 5243 for intervertebral disc syndrome.

After a review of all the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture most nearly approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 40 percent disability evaluation, for the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS.  

In this regard, the Board notes that, at the August 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's functional loss is due to decreased range of motion, which is reflected in the Veteran's difficulties with walking, standing, and weight-bearing.  Nonetheless, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  Range of motion was noted as forward flexion to 30 degrees, extension to 5 degrees, lateral flexion to 10 degrees bilaterally, and lateral rotation to 10 degrees bilaterally.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran's range of motion was unchanged upon repetitive use.  There was tenderness to palpation, muscle spasm, and guarding, without abnormal gait or spinal contour.  There was no evidence of ankylosis or muscle atrophy; muscle strength was normal, and reflexes were normal at the knee and ankle.  The VA examiner indicated that the Veteran has IVDS, and that imaging showed disc compression.  The VA examiner also noted that the Veteran did not experience incapacitating episodes requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician.  The VA examiner observed that the Veteran's functional ability is limited due to pain.  

The Board acknowledges that the August 2023 VA examiner did not provide an estimate as to range of motion with repetitive use over time and/or flare-ups, but reiterates that the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  Regarding repetitive use over time, the VA examiner opined that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination would not significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time.    

The Board notes that VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran complained of chronic back pain.  

In accordance with the above, the Board finds that the criteria for a higher disability rating of 50 percent have not been met or more nearly approximated.  The evidence does not demonstrate the presence of ankylosis or its equivalent during a flare-up.  The Board considered the lay evidence of pain.  However, that evidence does not establish that there is ankylosis as required for a higher rating.  As previously noted, throughout the rating period on appeal, the Veteran had flexion to no worse than 30 degrees.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  See also Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 32 (2017).  

The Board has also considered whether additional functional impairment due to factors such as pain, weakness and fatigability demonstrate additional limitation of motion or function to warrant a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59 and DeLuca at 206-07.  The evidence shows no atrophy or decrease in strength.  To the extent that the Veteran claims that his pain upon motion is the equivalent of limited motion, the Board finds that the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain have been contemplated in the current rating assignment, as the current rating is based on the objectively demonstrated reduced motion, during repetitive use over time, and there is no evidence that his pain is the equivalent of ankylosis.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011).  See also Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (the Court explained that the ankylosis requirement "can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare.").  To the extent that the Veteran reports limitations on his ability to sit, stand, and/or walk for prolonged periods, the Board finds that the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's manifestations more nearly approximate a disability picture with ankylosis.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  Therefore, the lay and medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms do not result in additional functional limitation to a degree that would support a rating in excess of a 40 percent disability rating at any point during the rating period on appeal.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been diagnosed with IVDS.  However, as previously discussed, the medical evidence demonstrates that his service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS has not been productive of incapacitating episodes at any time during the rating period on appeal.  The August 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not experience any incapacitating episodes or physician prescribed bed rest.  Likewise, a review of the Veteran's VA treatment records does not demonstrate that his treating physicians noted any incapacitating episodes or prescribed bed rest.  Thus, a higher rating based on IVDS is not warranted.

With consideration of the provisions of Note (1) of the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, the Veteran has been awarded service connection for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities and assigned a separate evaluation for each lower extremity.  As the Veteran is separately evaluated for his lower extremity neurological deficits, they are not for consideration here.

As the Veteran is does not experience bladder or bowel dysfunction due to his back condition, it is not for consideration here.

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence does not support a disability evaluation in excess of 40 percent for the Veteran's service-connected degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with compression fracture L3, spondylosis L4, lumbar strain, and IVDS.  The claim for an increased disability rating is denied.

6. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar, currently rated as 10 percent disabling,

The Veteran is currently assigned a 10 percent rating for his service-connected fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar, pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003 - 5228.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  

Diagnostic Code 5003 provides that degenerative arthritis substantiated by x-ray findings is rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved.  When limitation of motion is noncompensable under the appropriate diagnostic codes, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted for x-ray evidence of involvement of 2 or more major or minor joints, with occasional incapacitating exacerbations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.  However, the Veteran has not reported experiencing any incapacitating exacerbations with regard to his left thumb.

Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5228, a noncompensable disability rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of less than 1 inch (2.5 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5228.  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  Id.  A maximum schedular 20 percent disability rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the thumb with a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers.  Id.  There is no higher disability evaluation available under this Diagnostic Code.

Note (4) under the criteria for Evaluation of Ankylosis or Limitation of Motion of Single or Multiple Digits of the Hand indicates the following regarding evaluation of ankylosis of the thumb:  If both the carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints are ankylosed, and either is in extension or full flexion, or there is rotation or angulation of a bone, the condition should be evaluated as amputation at metacarpophalangeal joint or through proximal phalanx.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Evaluation of Ankylosis or Limitation of Motion of Single or Multiple Digits of the Hand, Note 4.  If both the carpometacarpal and interphalangeal joints are ankylosed, the condition should be evaluated as unfavorable ankylosis, even if each joint is individually fixed in a favorable position.  If only the carpometacarpal or interphalangeal joint is ankylosed, and there is a gap of more than two inches (5.1 cm.) between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers, the condition should be evaluated as unfavorable ankylosis. Finally, if only the carpometacarpal or interphalangeal joint is ankylosed, and there is a gap of two inches (5.1 cm.) or less between the thumb pad and the fingers, with the thumb attempting to oppose the fingers, the condition should be evaluated as favorable ankylosis.  Id.

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that the symptoms of the Veteran's service-connected fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar, most closely approximate the diagnostic criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent rating for the entire rating period on appeal.  With regard to limitation of motion, the Board observes that the Veteran, at the August 2023 VA examination, had a gap of 2.5 cm between the thumb pad and fingers; flexion to the metacarpophalangeal joint was to 20 degrees and flexion to the interphalangeal joint was to 20 degrees.  The August 2023 VA examiner noted that, following repetitive use over time, the gap between the thumb pad and fingers would be unchanged and that the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  Nevertheless, the Veteran reported that he experienced pain on flexion and extension, as well as tenderness to palpation of the left hand.  However, a 20 percent rating would require a gap of more than 2 inches between the thumb pad and fingers, which has not been demonstrated by the medical evidence of record.  In the absence of this level of limited motion, a higher rating based on limitation of motion is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5228.

Further, there is no evidence of ankylosis of the thumb at any time during the rating period on appeal.  Thus, a higher rating of the left thumb based on Diagnostic Code 5224 is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5224. 

Finally, with regard to functional loss, the Veteran's current evaluation contemplates pathology productive of painful motion.  The Board accepts the lay evidence that the Veteran experiences pain.  Similarly, the Board accepts the evidence that he has limitation of flexion of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the thumb.  However, the limitation of motion due to pain is contemplated in the current evaluation that recognizes his painful motion.  There is no indication that he has additional functional impairment, above and beyond the 10 percent level for his service-connected fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar, which would support a higher rating.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran reports reduced grip strength due to pain and weakness, but points out that the Veteran had normal grip strength on examination in August 2023.   See DeLuca, citing 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59.  As discussed, the available medical findings do not show that painful motion, limitation of motion on repetitive use testing, or pain or limitation of motion on active motion/passive motion/in weight-bearing/nonweight-bearing resulted in functional loss warranting the assignment of any higher evaluation for the right and/or left thumbs during the entire appeal period.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Additionally, there is no evidence that during flares the range of motion of the Veteran's left thumb is so limited by pain to equate to ankylosis such that a higher rating would be warranted on this basis. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (the Court explained that the ankylosis requirement "can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare.").

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence does not support a disability evaluation in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected fracture of the left thumb, post-operative, with scar, for the entire rating period on appeal.

7. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for left foot pes planus with plantar fasciitis, currently rated as 30 percent disabling.

The Veteran is in receipt of a 30 percent disability evaluation for his left foot pes planus with left foot plantar fasciitis pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5276.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5276, a noncompensable disability evaluation is assigned for mild flat foot with symptoms relieved by a built-up shoe or arch support.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate flat foot with the weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, inward bowing of the tendon Achilles, and pain on manipulation and use of the feet.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for unilateral severe flat foot with objective evidence of marked deformity (pronation, abduction, etc.), pain on manipulation and use accentuated, indications of swelling on use, and characteristic callosities.  A 30 percent rating for unilateral flat foot requires a pronounced condition manifested by marked pronation, extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces of the feet, marked inward displacement and severe spasm of the tendo Achilles on manipulation, not improved by orthopedic shoes or appliances.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5276. 

The Board notes that, effective February 7, 2021, plantar fasciitis is now rated under Diagnostic Code 5269 of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); amended 86 Fed. Reg. 8142 (Feb. 4, 2021) (to be codified at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269). 

Under Diagnostic Code 5269, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for all other circumstances, unilateral or bilateral.  A 20 percent disability rating is warranted for plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment, unilateral.  A 30 percent disability rating is warranted for plantar fasciitis with no relief from both non-surgical and surgical treatment, bilateral.  Note (1): With actual loss of use of the foot, rate at 40 percent. Note (2): If a Veteran has been recommended for surgical intervention, but is not a surgical candidate, evaluate under the 20 percent or 30 percent criteria, whichever is applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269.

After a review of the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected left foot pes planus most closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 30 percent disability rating, for the entire rating period on appeal.  At the August 2023 VA examination, he reported experiencing pain and fatigue on use of the left foot.  Upon examination, he did not have marked pronation or deformity of the left foot, but he did have accentuated pain on manipulation of the left foot, inward bowing of the Achilles tendon, and decreased longitudinal arch height; he also had extreme tenderness of the plantar surfaces.  At the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran had pain upon weight-bearing and ambulation, characteristic callosities, and swelling on use; he did not have weight-bearing line over or medial to the great toe, marked inward displacement, or severe spasm of the tendo Achilles on manipulation.  

The Board notes that the 30 percent rating assigned herein for unilateral pes planus is the highest allowable schedular rating under this diagnostic code.  Therefore, a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted on a schedular basis under Diagnostic Code 5276.

Nevertheless, the Board has also considered whether a rating in excess of 30 percent is warranted on an extraschedular basis.  Although the Board may not assign an extraschedular rating in the first instance, it must adjudicate whether to refer a case for extraschedular evaluation when the issue either is raised by the claimant or is reasonably raised by the evidence of record.  In considering whether an extraschedular rating may be warranted, VA must first determine whether the available applicable schedular rating criteria are inadequate because they do not contemplate the Veteran's level of disability and symptomatology.  As discussed above, the Veteran's foot pain is specifically contemplated by the rating criteria, which specifically allows for a 30 percent rating for pain and tenderness.  Moreover, even if the schedular criteria were not adequate, there is no indication that the Veteran's left foot pes planus, standing alone, causes marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization.  Thus, referral for consideration of the assignment of a disability evaluation on an extraschedular basis is not warranted.  

The Board also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the foot, and finds that the Veteran is entitled to a separate, 10 percent disability evaluation for his left foot plantar fasciitis. The Board notes that plantar fasciitis is one of the foot conditions specifically listed in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, and that to rate his plantar fasciitis under any other foot Diagnostic Code would constitute an impermissible rating by analogy.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 338 (2015).  In this regard, the Board reiterates that, under Diagnostic Code 5269, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for unilateral or bilateral plantar fasciitis. 

However, the Veteran does not demonstrate symptomatology supportive of a separate rating under any of the other Diagnostic Codes governing evaluation of the foot, i.e., no atrophy, no contraction of the toes, no Morton's disease, no equivalent of amputation of the great toe, and no malunion of the tarsal bones; there is also no evidence of hammer toes or hallux valgus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5280, 5281, 5282, 5283.  Although the Veteran has significant symptoms related to his left foot pes planus, to assign a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 5284 for foot injuries would be impermissible pyramiding, as the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses is to be avoided.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The Court has emphasized that a claimant may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity."  Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993).

As such, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected left foot pes planus does not warrant a disability evaluation in excess of 30 percent.  The Veteran is also entitled to a separate 10 percent disability evaluation for his left foot plantar fasciitis for the entire rating period on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3, 4.7.  

8. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, currently rated as 10 percent disabling,

9. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, currently rated as 10 percent disabling.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 10 percent disability evaluation, per lower extremity, for his radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, a 10 percent disability evaluation is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 20 percent evaluation is assigned for moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve and a 30 percent disability rating requires moderately severe incomplete paralysis.  A 50 percent rating requires severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy.  An 80 percent disability rating requires complete paralysis; the foot dangles and drops, no active movement is possible of muscles below the knee, and flexion of the knee is weakened or lost.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  

The Court in Chavis v. McDonough held that benchmarks established by VA must be discussed in addressing the subjective terms of these regulations.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) ("Without established benchmarks for those subjective terms, the Court is left without standards upon which to review the Board's decision." (citing Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011))).

The Board notes, for reference and illustrative purposes, that the definition for "mild" includes not very severe.  WEBSTER'S II NEW COLLEGE DICTIONARY at 694 (1995).  In addition, a synonym for "mild" is "slight," and definitions for "slight" include small in size, degree, or amount.  Id. at 1038.  The definitions for "moderate" include of average or medium quantity, quality, or extent.  Id. at 704.  Finally, definitions of "severe" include extremely intense.  Id. at 1012.  It is noted that the term "moderately severe" indicates impairment greater than moderate, but not to the extent as to be considered severe.

The Board also finds that "mild" corresponds to symptoms, however slight, sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for service connection purposes.  In general, this level of severity is limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area.  A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

"Moderate" symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling.  In such cases, a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms.  Other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

The "moderately severe" evaluation level is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve.  This is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.  Motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected.  Atrophy may be present.  However, for marked muscular atrophy, see the criteria for a "severe" evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Finally, the "severe" evaluation level is characterized by motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases.  For the sciatic nerve (38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520), marked muscular atrophy is expected.  Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.  Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve (38 C.F.R. § 4.123). 

The term "incomplete paralysis" with peripheral nerve injuries indicates a degree of loss or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  See note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a).

In July 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Affairs held that the assignment of ratings based on paralysis does not preclude separate ratings for neuritis or neuralgia of the same nerve.  Banschbach v. McDonough, No. 22-6609, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1163 (Vet. App. July 26, 2024).  The Court explained that each nerve has a diagnostic code and rating scale for paralysis, as well as additional diagnostic codes (but no ratings) for "neuritis" and "neuralgia." The Court acknowledged that adjudicators must avoid pyramiding, i.e., evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses.  However, the Court noted that the rating schedule provides that separate conditions or manifestations of the same condition are to be rated separately, unless otherwise provided by the rating schedule. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25(b).  Moreover, the Court concluded that the Board must exhaust all schedular alternative for rating a disability.  See Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 168 (2019).  The Court further noted that paralysis, neuritis, and neuralgia are uniquely defined, indicating that each may present separately ratable manifestations. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.123, neuritis, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. See nerve involved for diagnostic code number and rating. The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in this section will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.

Neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, described in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124, is characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis. See nerve involved for diagnostic code number and rating. Tic douloureux, or trifacial neuralgia, may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve.

After a review of all the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy most closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent disability evaluation, per lower extremity, for the rating period on appeal.  In this regard, the Board notes that, at the August 2023 VA back examination, the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy was described as mild for the right and left lower extremities.  The August 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran had mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, mild intermittent pain, and experiencing mild numbness.  At the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran had decreased sensation of the feet and toes bilaterally.  However, muscle strength was normal and there was no evidence of muscle atrophy; the Veteran's deep tendon reflexes were also normal.  The Board points out that the Veteran's symptomatology was relatively consistent during the rating period and the Veteran's VA treatment records for the rating period do not demonstrate a worsening of manifestations consistent with moderate radiculopathy of the lower extremities.

The Board finds that, in considering the evidence as a whole, the characterization of the Veteran's symptomatology as mild by the August 2023 VA examiner is highly probative.  The August 2023 VA examiner performed a physical examination and relevant testing prior to determining the extent of his radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities.  Additionally, the dictionary definition of mild is in accordance with the Veteran's overall disability picture, his symptoms were limited in scope and effect.  Further, as discussed, he experiences mild, intermittent pain and his paresthesias/dysesthesias and numbness were described as no more than mild.  All other symptoms were sensory only.  

In conclusion, the Veteran's symptomatology most closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent disability evaluation, per lower extremity, for mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve as a result of his service-connected radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities.  The Board notes that the Veteran asserted that his symptoms have worsened.  Nonetheless, the evidence of record, to include his statements that his symptoms have worsened, does not demonstrate that he experiences moderate incomplete paralysis of the right and/or left sciatic nerve during this rating period.  Further, separate ratings for neuritis and neuralgia are not warranted as the Veteran's symptoms of intermittent pain and paresthesias are compensated in the current 10 percent rating and a separate rating would constitute prohibited pyramiding.  In reaching this determination, the Board has considered the guidance provided by 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.123, and 4.124.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent, per lower extremity, for his service-connected radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.  The claims for increased ratings are denied.

10. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for traumatic arthritis, right ankle lateral collateral ligament strain, currently rated as 10 percent disabling.

11. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for traumatic arthritis, left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, currently rated as 10 percent disabling.

The Veteran is assigned a 10 percent disability evaluation, per ankle, for his traumatic arthritis, right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, and traumatic arthritis, left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5010 - 5271.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.   

Diagnostic Code 5010 directs that post-traumatic arthritis should be rated as "limitation of motion, dislocation, or other specified instability under the affected joint." 

Under Diagnostic Code 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limitation of motion, and a 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limitation of motion.  Moderate limited motion is defined as "less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion."  Marked limited motion is defined as "less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

The 20 percent rating provided in Diagnostic Code 5271 is the highest rating available for limitation of motion for ankle disabilities. In order to get a higher rating, there must be ankylosis of the ankle.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Diagnostic Code 5270.

Normal range of motion for the ankles is zero (0) to 20 degrees dorsiflexion and zero (0) to 45 degrees plantar flexion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II. 

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran's traumatic arthritis, right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, and traumatic arthritis, left ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain, are manifested by moderate limitation of motion of each ankle, and thus, most closely approximate the criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent disability evaluation, per ankle, for the entire rating period on appeal.  Significantly, the August 2023 VA examination showed that the Veteran had dorsiflexion to 10 degrees and plantar flexion to 25 degrees for each ankle, unchanged with repetitive use testing.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  The Board acknowledges that the VA examiner did not provide range of motion estimates for repetitive use over time, but the VA examiner noted that the evidence did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination which significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time for either ankle.  The August 2023 VA examination report was negative for ankylosis of either ankle, and there was no evidence of deformity of the right and/or left ankle joints.  The August 2023 VA examination reports reflect that there was no evidence of instability of either ankle upon examination; the Board also notes that the Veteran did not report a history of instability at the August 2023 VA examination.  The Board further notes that the Veteran's VA treatment records demonstrate that the Veteran experienced pain on motion of his right and left ankles during the rating period.  The 10 percent disability evaluation per ankle contemplates painful motion, as well as limitation of motion.

To the extent that the Veteran claims that his pain upon motion of his right and left ankles is the equivalent of limited motion, the Board finds that the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain have been contemplated in the current rating assignment, as the current rating is based on the objectively demonstrated reduced motion; the VA examination report indicates that the Veteran complained of pain, but physical examination did not demonstrate any additional limitations in response to pain, including incoordination, weakness, or fatigability, beyond which was reflected in the examination report.  Therefore, the lay and medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms do not result in additional functional limitation to a degree that would support a rating in excess of a 10 percent disability evaluation, per ankle, for his traumatic arthritis, lateral collateral ligament sprain of the right and left ankles.

The Board also considered whether the Veteran may be entitled to a higher rating under other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes for the rating period.  With regard to the criteria under Diagnostic Code 5270, there is no evidence of ankylosis of the right and/or left ankles.  The above evidence reflects that, at no time during the appeal period, to include during flares, have the Veteran's symptoms more nearly approximated ankylosis of the right and/or left ankles in plantar flexion between 30 and 40 degrees or in dorsiflexion between 0 and 10 degrees, or in plantar flexion at more than 40 degrees, or in dorsiflexion at more than 10 degrees with abduction, adduction, inversion, or eversion deformity warranting a 30 or 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5270.  See also Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (the Court explained that the ankylosis requirement "can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare.").  

The other diagnostic codes applicable to the ankle, 5272 through 5274, applicable to ankylosis of subastralgar or tarsal joint, malunion of os calcis, and astragalectomy, also provide for 20 percent ratings; however, these Codes also require ankylosis.  As such, the Board does not find that the medical evidence supports higher schedular ratings for the right and left ankles under these provisions.

REASONS FOR REMAND

12. Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded.

13. Entitlement to SMC on the basis of housebound status is remanded.

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of his service- connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.   

A TDIU may be granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining or obtaining of substantially gainful employment.  If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be ratable at 60 percent or more to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability.  If there are two or more such disabilities, there must be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). For purposes of this section, disabilities of both upper or lower extremities will be considered a single disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a)(1).

Veterans who, in light of their individual circumstances, but without regard to age, are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled, without regard to whether an average person would be rendered unemployable by the circumstances. Thus, the criteria include a subjective standard.  Unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGCPREC 75-91; 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (1992). "Substantially gainful employment" is that employment "which is ordinarily followed by the nondisabled to earn their livelihood with earnings common to the particular occupation in the community where the veteran resides."  Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991).  "Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment."  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran seeks entitlement to TDIU based on his service-connected disabilities.

The Board observes that the rating period on appeal begins April 25, 2023, the date that the Veteran informed VA of his intent to file a claim for benefits; the Veteran's claim was received on July 17, 2023.  

The Board notes that, as a result of the Board's award of an increased, 30 percent disability evaluation for migraine headaches and a separate, 10 percent disability evaluation for left foot plantar fasciitis, herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a combined schedular 100 percent disability evaluation for the period beginning April 25, 2023.  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court/CAVC) has held that a 100 percent schedular rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled.  See Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994) (citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990)).  Thus, if VA has found a Veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or combination of disabilities pursuant to the Rating Schedule, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that Veteran totally disabled on any other basis, such as TDIU.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding request for a TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

Nevertheless, the Board notes that a 100 percent disability evaluation does not necessarily render the issue of TDIU moot.  In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008), the Court held that a TDIU satisfies the total (100 percent) rating requirement if the TDIU evaluation was, or can be, predicated upon a single disability and there exists additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, for purposes of entitlement to SMC for a housebound rating.  In other words, 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) for housebound benefits does not limit "a service-connected disability rated as total" to only a schedular rating of 100 percent; a TDIU rating based on a single disability is permitted to satisfy the statutory requirement of a total rating.  Id.  

The Board notes that the question of whether the Veteran may be entitled to an award of special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate has been reasonably raised by the record.  In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293-94 (2008), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) determined that a separate TDIU predicated on one disability (although perhaps not ratable at the schedular 100-percent level) when considered together with another disability separately rated at 60 percent or more could entitle the Veteran to SMC at the housebound rate pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).  The evidence of record is unclear if any of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, standing alone, are sufficient to warrant an award of TDIU predicated solely on that service-connected disability.

Although no formal claim for SMC during this period has been submitted, one is not needed for this type of ancillary benefit that is part of an underlying claim of benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(2).  See also Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118 (1991) (observing that entitlement to SMC is an "inferred issue" in the context of an increased rating claim that must be considered when the record indicates that it may be available, even if the claimant does not place eligibility for this ancillary benefit at issue).   Accordingly, the AOJ is directed to consider whether the Veteran is entitled to TDIU based on a single service-connected disability and thus whether SMC on the basis of housebound status for the rating period since April 25, 2023.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Request an opinion as to whether any of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, standing alone, impacts his ability to perform physical and mental tasks in a work-like setting, without regard to the Veteran's age or the impact of any other service-connected or nonservice-connected disabilities.

2.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for housebound status by an appropriate clinician to determine the current level of severity of all impairment resulting from his service-connected disabilities. 

The claims folder, including a copy of this remand, should be made available to the examiner for review prior to the examination. The examiner should acknowledge such review in the examination report.

After examining the Veteran and reviewing the record, the examiner should address whether the Veteran is housebound due to his service-connected disabilities.

3.  When the above development has been completed, adjudicate the issues on appeal.
