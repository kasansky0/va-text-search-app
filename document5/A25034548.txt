FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes that the Veteran's tinnitus manifested within one year of his separation from service and has been chronic since manifestation.

2. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss manifested within one year of his separation from service and has been chronic since manifestation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bilateral tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309.

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307(a), 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1966 to October 1969.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran timely initiated an appeal by submitting a November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the elected the Hearing docket.

In March 2025, following the Board hearing, the Veteran filed a waiver of the remaining time for evidence submission.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the October 2024 rating decision on appeal, as well, as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or before the waiver of time was filed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) after the waiver of remaining time for evidence submission, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

For veterans with 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic diseases, including organic diseases of the nervous system such as sensorineural hearing loss, are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where a chronic disease, such as sensorineural hearing loss or tinnitus, is shown as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected.  If a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required.  Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies only when the disability for which the Veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Ordinarily a lay person is?competent?to report symptoms and experiences observable?by their senses; however, a lay person is?usually?not competent?to prove a matter requiring medical expertise.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1377?(Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown,?6 Vet. App. 465, 470?(1994).

1. The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral tinnitus.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is due to his active-duty military service.  See March 2025 Board Hearing Transcript; January 2024 Correspondence.

In the October 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (service in Vietnam); (2) there was a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service as the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise as evidenced by his military occupational specialty of infantryman; and (3) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of tinnitus.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his military service or whether the tinnitus manifested within one year of service with continuous symptomology since.

During a March 2011 VA hearing examination, the Veteran reported intermittent tinnitus since service.  The Veteran noted his noise exposure in service included combat in Vietnam consistent of fire fights and exposure to tank fire.  He denied occupational and recreational noise exposure. 

During the pendency of this claim, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination in September 2023.  In the examination and medical opinion, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not the result of military noise exposure.  The opinion relied on a lack of evidence of auditory damage on active duty and lack of evidence of continuity of care since service.  However, the examiner did not address the Veteran's report of a tank firing right overhead or his statements in 2011 that his tinnitus has been intermittent since service.  

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a detailed outline of his noise exposure in service which included an incident were a tank drove up from behind and fired a round over his head which resulted in a loss of hearing for two days.  He further stated that after returning from Vietnam, he noticed ringing in his ears.

At the Board hearing in March 2025, the Veteran testified that he suffered from hearing loss for two days in service when a tank fired over his head during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam.  The Veteran's daughter relayed information that the Veteran had previously informed her of which included that he noticed ringing in his ears following his service in Vietnam.

The Board notes the September 2023 examination characterization of the Veteran's assertion that his tinnitus has been constant since 2015-2017, prior to which it was a weekly occurrence since 2005-2008.  However, there is no evidence that the examiner asked the Veteran about his statement in 2011 when he asserted tinnitus since service nor about any effects from events in combat.

The Board acknowledges that tinnitus is a condition capable of both lay observation and diagnosis.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as ringing or buzzing in his ears as this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007).  In addition, the Veteran is competent to identify a disorder such as tinnitus for diagnostic purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 310; Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 405 (1995).  

Further, the Board finds the Veteran's assertions in March 2011, January 2024, and March 2025 regarding the onset of his tinnitus adequate and credible.  As noted above, tinnitus is a disability eligible for service connection on a presumptive basis as a chronic disease.  The Veteran's competent and credible lay statements are the most probative evidence of record.  His lay statements sufficiently establish that his tinnitus was shown to be a chronic disease with manifestation within one year of service as required by the presumptive period, and that it has continued since that time.  See Charles, 16 Vet. App. at 374.  The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's tinnitus pre-dates any post-service intercurrent causes.  The Board finds the Veteran's opinion related to his tinnitus probative. 

Given the diagnosed tinnitus, the in-service noise exposure, and the evidence of continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service, the Veteran's tinnitus is presumed to have been incurred in service and service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

2. The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that his hearing loss is due to his active-duty military service.  See March 2025 Board Hearing Transcript; January 2024 Correspondence.

In the October 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (service in Vietnam); (2) there was a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service as the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise as evidenced by his military occupational specialty of infantryman; and (2) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of bilateral hearing loss.  No clear or unmistakable errors have been shown to rebut these findings; therefore, these favorable findings are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and his military service or whether the hearing loss manifested within one year of service with continuous symptomology since.

During a March 2011 VA hearing examination, the Veteran reported his noise exposure in service included combat in Vietnam consistent of fire fights and exposure to tank fire.  He denied occupational and recreational noise exposure and reported difficulty with hearing in groups and noisy settings.  The VA examiner noted normal hearing through the mid frequencies but mild to moderate severe hearing loss at high frequencies for both ears.  The audiometric data is not in the Veteran's file.

During the pendency of this claim, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination in September 2023.  In the examination and medical opinion, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was less likely than not the result of military noise exposure.  The opinion relied on a lack of evidence of auditory damage on active duty and lack of evidence of continuity of case since service.  However, the examiner did not address the Veteran's report of a tank firing right overhead.  

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a detailed outline of his noise exposure in service which included an incident were a tank drove up from behind and fired a round over his head which resulted in a loss of hearing for two days.  He further stated that after returning from Vietnam, he noticed he could not hear high pitch noises.

At the Board hearing in March 2025, the Veteran testified that he suffered from hearing loss for two days in service when a tank fired over his head during the Tet Offensive in Vietnam.  The Veteran also testified that he could not hear high pithed sounds in 1969 after leaving the military.

The Board notes that the hearing examinations that the Veteran received in service at entrance and separation were incomplete as both examinations lacked results at the 3000 Hz frequency and did not test speech recognition.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The medical opinion based on an inaccurate factual premise is not probative. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993).  Here, the examiner's conclusion is based in part on the Veteran's entrance and separation exams which as noted were incomplete.  Further, the examiner did not reconcile the lay statements of record regarding combat noise and tank firing overhead resulting in hearing loss for two days.  Therefore, the probative weight of the opinion is diminished.

As to the continuity of the Veteran's symptoms, though the evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not actively seek a medical evaluation for hearing loss for many years after separation from service, the Board assigns substantial weight to the lay statements that tend to establish that the Veteran experienced and displayed a loss of hearing acuity corresponding with a major incident in service with continuity thereafter.  The Veteran has consistently asserted that he experienced two days of hearing loss in service after the tank fired overhead with continuity of symptoms after his discharge.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that he had continuous symptoms of hearing loss since separation and meets the requirements of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).
