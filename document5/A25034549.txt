REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A lower back condition was not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty service and is not otherwise related to service. 

2. A neck condition was not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty service and is not otherwise related to service.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right ankle disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a left ankle disability at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had right ear hearing loss per VA standards at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had left ear hearing loss per VA standards at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 

7. The Veteran reported onset of bilateral tinnitus during service. 

8. The Veteran's bilateral tinnitus is related to in-service noise exposure.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1990 to June 1994.

The Veteran filed his claims of service connection for January 2022. The claims were denied by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in a May 2022 rating decision. 

In May 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, requesting review of a July 2008 rating decision denying service connection for PTSD. The Veteran also filed a supplemental claim requesting review of the denial of claims of service connection for a low back disorder, neck disorder, left ankle disorder, right ankle disorder, right ear hearing loss, left ear hearing loss, right ear tinnitus, and left ear tinnitus. Although the Veteran identified the July 2008 rating decision as the date of VA decision notice, the Board notes that the issues were denied in the May 2022 rating decision and not prior to that date. 

In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ deferred a decision on the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD and denied the remaining claims. The claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD was subsequently denied in a March 2024 rating decision. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. However, with regard to the issue of service connection for PTSD, the Board notes that the Veteran identified the January 2024 rating decision and not the March 2024 rating decision. A deferred rating decision is not a final decision that may be appealed to the Board. See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) (holding that "because there is no "final decision" when the [AOJ] issues a deferred rating decision, there has been no "adjudicative determination" from which an NOD can be filed").

However, because this VA Form 10182 was received within one year of that March 2024 rating decision, the Board is compelled to find that this VA Form 10182 is a proper appeal with the March 2024 rating decision. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (holding that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option," although election of a second review option while another review option was pending (a concurrent election) was clearly prohibited).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection claims

Under the modernized system, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim following notice of a decision by the AOJ or the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to the supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1). Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim, including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(2). If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Disability refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d. 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that pain can constitute a current disability, even without an underlying diagnosis, if it causes sufficient functional impairment).

Where the evidence shows a "chronic disease" in service or "continuity of symptoms" after service, the disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service. For the showing of a "chronic" disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. With a chronic disease as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. If a condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic, then generally, a showing of "continuity of symptoms" after service is required for service connection. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Additionally, where a veteran served ninety days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (a). While the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. Here, the Veteran has a diagnosis of arthritis, which is a chronic disorder but as it was not manifest to a degree of 10 percent of more within a year of separation from service, presumptive service connection is not warranted.

The Board must determine the value of all pertinent lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The evaluation of evidence generally involves three steps: competency, credibility and weighing the evidence. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. Competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2).

Lay evidence may be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition (i.e., when the layperson will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer); (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or; (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377, n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, laypersons have generally been found to not be competent to provide evidence in more complex medical situations. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (concerning rheumatic fever).

The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible; in determining whether documents submitted by a veteran are credible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence considering the entirety of the record.

When there is an approximate balance of evidence shown, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is for application. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for lower back condition (claimed as lumbosacral-thoracolumbar spine) 

2. Entitlement to service connection for neck pain condition (claimed as cervical strain) 

The Veteran contends that he has back and neck disorders as a result of service.

Service treatment records show a July 1992 x-ray of the lower spine showed "some enlargement of the left pedicle of L1 could be related to benign tumor or maybe developmental. Otherwise, the study is unremarkable." In July 1993, the Veteran sought treatment for three days of back pain and neck pain.  In the April 1994 report of medical history at separation, the Veteran denied recurrent back pain, swollen or painful joints. He endorsed "bone, joint, or other deformity" but did not specify the effected part (he noted foot trouble). A contemporaneous clinical evaluation of all systems was normal. 

In a February 2022 VA examination report, the examiner noted diagnoses of degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease. He reported onset of back and neck pain in 1992, lifting heavy equipment during service. In a May 2022 VA opinion, the examiner opined that the Veterans lumbar spine and cervical spine disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by service. He provided the following rationale:

"Pt separated on June 30, 1994.  Based on the review of the evidence of record, there is insufficient evidence to establish any continuity of symptoms with military service.  Any previous in-service back complaints this pt may have had entirely self-resolved.  This is objectively evidenced by SF-88 separation physical dated 4/29/1994 which is silent for the diagnosis of any neck or back condition.  In fact, it specifically notes a completely normal neck and spine exam.

Additionally, on self-reported SF-93 separation medical history dated 4/29/1994, the pt himself explicitly indicates that he does NOT have any neck / back issues. Thus, based on the evidence of record, there is insufficient evidence to establish a nexus, with greater than 50% probability, that this pt's current lower back is incurred in and/or caused by the in service complaint."

Post service treatment records show the Veteran denied neck pain in December 2022. In March 2023, the Veteran had full range of motion of the neck without difficulty. In May 2023, the clinician noted full range of motion to his cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine.  In July 2023, the Veteran denied neck pain, muscle weakness, joint stiffness, swelling, and pain.

In a January 2024 VA examination report, the examiner opined that the Veteran's low back and neck disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. He provided the following rationale, noting a current disability, but also noting:

"[T]here is no evidence that the veteran was seen or treated for a back [and neck] condition while on active duty service. The veterans end of service was in 1994 and no reports on separation exam for neck pain."

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that service connection for low back and neck disorders is not warranted. Although there is evidence of an in-service event of complaints of low back pain, the Veteran affirmatively denied neck or back pain at discharge and a clinical evaluation was normal. Moreover, the Veteran denied back and neck pain in the 2023 VA treatment records. See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 498. Finally, the February 2022 VA examiner opined that the evidence did not support a nexus between the Veteran's present diagnoses and service, given the affirmative evidence of no back pain and a normal evaluation at discharge. 

The Board has considered the January 2024 VA opinion, but finds that it is predicated on the examiner's finding that there was no evidence the Veteran was seen or treated for a back or neck condition in service. Therefore, the opinion has no probative value. Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993). However, the Board finds the totality of the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims and there is no doubt to be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle condition 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle condition

Service treatment records show no complaints, diagnoses, or treatment for ankle injuries or disorders.  In the April 1994 report of medical history at separation, the Veteran denied swollen or painful joints and arthritis. He endorsed "bone, joint, or other deformity" but did not specify the effected part (he noted foot trouble). A contemporaneous clinical evaluation of all systems was normal. 

Post service treatment records show no evidence of a right or left ankle injury or disorder. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024. The Veteran reported pain, soreness, and stiffness in the ankles that started as a result of general wear and tear from his military career. He reported moderate flare ups that occur weekly and are precipitated by weight bearing activity. Upon examination, range of motion testing was normal with no objective evidence of pain, crepitus, or localized tenderness. The examiner opined that the Veteran would be limited to 40 degrees of plantar flexion and 15 degrees of dorsiflexion with flare ups. The examiner opined that there was no diagnosis of a right or left ankle disorder, because "there are no findings, signs, and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis."

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted.  The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have diagnoses of left or right ankle disorders at any time during the pendency of the claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107 (b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d).

The Veteran is competent to report symptoms he experienced first-hand, such as right and left ankle pain, but he is not competent to diagnose a right or left ankle disability. However, there are no available treatment records showing the presence of current diagnoses of right or left ankle disabilities and the VA examiner affirmatively found no evidence to support a diagnosis. In the absence of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).

Pain alone, even without an underlying diagnosis, can constitute a current disability for VA compensation purposes if it reaches the level of functional impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1367-68. Here, there is competent evidence of pain in the Veteran's left and right ankles. The January 2024 VA examiner found no functional impact for the right or left ankles as to his occupation and the Veteran did not report functional limitations. Rather, the Veteran only stated that overextending himself will cause increased pain. The Board finds that this increased pain does not rise to the requisite level of functional impairment of earning capacity to constitute a disability for VA compensation purposes pursuant to Saunders. Specifically, the Veteran did not report time lost from work due to his right or left ankle pain. As such, the Board does not find a functional impairment of earning capacity because, to the extent that left and right ankle pain occurs, the symptoms have not impacted the Veteran's functioning.

Therefore, there is no medical evidence to even suggest that his reported left and right ankle pain results in a functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1356. Nevertheless, the Board emphasizes that left and right ankle diagnoses are not supported by the competent evidence of record.

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had left or right ankle disabilities at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. As there are no current disabilities, a discussion of any in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, or nexus, is unnecessary. As such, without competent evidence of a diagnosis of left or right ankle disabilities, service connection cannot be awarded. 

5. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss

6. Entitlement to service connection for right ear hearing loss

The Veteran contends that he has hearing loss in the right and left ears as a result of exposure to hazardous noise in service.

In the January 2024 rating decision, VA identified the following favorable finding: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. Your DD-214 shows your assigned MOS was Medical Equipment Repairer which has a low probability of hazardous military noise exposure." The Board is bound by this finding. 

Regarding the existence of a current hearing loss disability, for the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current bilateral hearing loss disability that began during or as a result of service.

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss per VA standards and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294; McClain, 21 Vet. App. at 321. 

Post-service treatment records do not contain any audiometric testing. The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in January 2024 and the Veteran's pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	65	60	65	85	95

LEFT	95	80	100	105+	105+

While the Board acknowledges that these findings do meet the criteria set out in the regulations, the VA examiner explained that the Veteran's test results are not valid for rating purposes (not indicative of organic hearing loss) for the following reasons:

"Test results were inconsistent which is suggestive of non-organic or exaggerated hearing loss which is not appropriate for rating purposes:    

"	Stenger is positive at 500 - 4000 Hz.    

"	Claimant responses were inconsistent.    

"	Claimant was able to communicate at a normal conversational level and was able to understand instructions presented via audiometer talk-forward at 50 dB HL.   

"	Significant disagreement between PTA and SRT.    

"	Significant disagreement between hearing thresholds and acoustic reflex thresholds.   

"	Claimant was rhyming words during speech testing."

The examiner indicated that these test results were inconsistent, which is suggestive of non-organic or exaggerated hearing loss which is not appropriate for rating purposes. While the Veteran is competent to report hearing loss, he is not credible in the report per the examination and testing equipment. Caluza, 7 Vet. App. 498. His statements are assigned less weight. 

In the absence of valid audiometric test findings showing that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of right or left hearing loss per VA standards, service connection is not warranted, and the claim is denied. Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence and the findings of the VA examiner.

7. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Service treatment records do not reflect any symptoms, diagnosis, or treatment for a tinnitus disability.

In the January 2024 rating decision, VA identified the following favorable finding: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. Your DD-214 shows your assigned MOS was Medical Equipment Repairer which has a low probability of hazardous military noise exposure." The Board is bound by this finding. 

At the January 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported recurrent tinnitus that had its onset during service as he participated in artillery field exercises.  The examiner stated that he cannot provide a medical opinion regarding the etiology of the veteran's tinnitus without resorting to speculation because, his results were inconsistent which is suggestive of non-organic or exaggerated hearing loss which is not appropriate for rating purposes. 

As discussed above, the Board is cognizant that the Veteran's audiometry results were inconsistent and could not provide the basis of a diagnosis of a hearing loss disability. However, the Veteran is competent to provide evidence of his observable symptoms, specifically his tinnitus and its onset. There is some evidence of noise exposure in service.  Therefore, with reasonable doubt resolved in the Veteran's favor, service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD is remanded.

Remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

The Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for PTSD. Additionally, although no formal claim has been filed, he claimed entitlement to service connection for schizoaffective disorder. VA treatment records show the Veteran was treated for various mental health disorders. In an April 2008 mental health treatment record, the Veteran reported mental health symptoms, including flashbacks, depression, and anxiety that were related to his military service. 

VA must expand a claim for a specific mental health disability to encompass all psychiatric diagnoses. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009). To date, the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to assess the nature and etiology of any claimed acquired psychiatric disorder. VA must provide an examination where the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim but contains: (1) competent evidence of diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability, (2) establishes an event, injury or disease in-service, and (3) indicates that the claimed disability may be associated with the in-service event, injury, or disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006) (noting that the evidence need only "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between the current disability or symptoms and active service, including equivocal or non-specific medical evidence or credible lay evidence of continuity of symptomatology).

The Board finds that pre-decisional duty to assist error was committed because the AOJ failed to schedule the Veteran for the appropriate VA examination. When the Board identifies a pre-decisional duty to assist error, under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159 (c), 20.802(a), the Board must remand the appeal back to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the claims folder to a VA psychiatrist or psychologist for an examination of the Veteran, to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD. The claims file must be made available to the examiner, who must acknowledge receipt and review of these materials in any report generated. The examiner must review all medical evidence associated with the claims file. All indicated tests and studies must be performed.

2. The examiner must take a complete history from the Veteran. If there is any clinical or medical basis for corroborating or discounting the credibility of the history provided by the Veteran, the examiner must so state, with a complete rationale in support of such a finding.

3. If the Veteran is diagnosed with PTSD, the examiner must explain how the diagnostic criteria are met and state the stressor(s) that form the basis of the diagnosis. 

4. If the Veteran is diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD, the examiner must opine whether it was incurred during or as a result of active service.

5. The examiner must provide a complete explanation for his or her opinion(s), based on his or her clinical experience, medical expertise, and established principles.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
