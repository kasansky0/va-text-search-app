DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

An initial rating of 50 percent for migraines throughout the appeal period from February 1, 2021, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted. 

Entitlement to an effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the appeal period from February 1, 2021, the Veteran's migraines more nearly approximate very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

2. The matter of the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU was raised during the pendency of the appeal for an increased rating for service-connected migraines, which was pending since February 1, 2021; and a VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, was received on February 17, 2022.

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that effective February 1, 2021, the Veteran has met the schedular criteria for a TDIU and the evidence shows the combined effects of his service-connected disabilities as likely as not rendered him unable to maintain gainful employment.

4. The Veteran met the minimum threshold requirement to be considered for basic eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 as of February 1, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for an initial 50 percent rating for migraines have been met throughout the appeal period from February 1, 2021. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

2. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16.

3. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 3511, 3512, 5107, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 21.3041, 21.4131(d)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from July 2010 to November 2013 and participated in combat as reflected in his receipt of the Combat Infantryman Badge.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision. In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 rating decision. In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating Claim

1. Initial compensable rating for migraines.

Service connection for migraines was granted in a May 2022 rating decision that assigned an initial noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating effective February 25, 2022. The effective date was amended to February 1, 2021, in a January 2023 HLR rating decision. The Veteran has continuously pursued the initial rating assigned for this disability; as such, the relevant initial rating period for migraines is from February 1, 2021. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

The Veteran appeals for a higher initial disability rating for the service-connected migraines. 

In an affidavit dated February 9, 2022, the Veteran reported frequent severe headaches brought on by light sensitivity to the point he cannot function, must lay down to alleviate symptoms, and had to leave multiple jobs. 

The Veteran specifically wants a 50 percent rating to be assigned for migraine headaches going back to February 1, 2021, because his claim has been pending since then and continuously appealed since then. He acknowledges that a March 2021 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) indicates he did not have prostrating attacks but asserts that the symptoms described within the examination report contradict that finding. On that point, the Veteran reported that he was unable to concentrate for longer than 20 minutes without experiencing headaches, which he asserts indicates both frequent, essentially daily, and prostrating attacks. See October 2022 statement.

In a February 2023 statement, the Veteran reported that since at least February 2021, he had experienced prostrating headaches three times per week. The migraines require him to stop what he is doing and lay down in a dark room. It was important that the room is dark, because when he has a headache, he is very sensitive to light, which can make the headache worse. He reported that he was currently take Excedrin to help with the pounding and pain which helped but did not take away the pain completely. His headaches impact his ability to work, as lighting and computers are causes of his headaches. The Veteran reported that when working for VA, he left work early or called out sick at least three times per month because of headaches. And when working from home selling life insurance, he was able to lay down until the headache subsided. This would happen a few times each week and it affected his productivity and ability to successfully do his work. He described getting behind on phone calls and reported that the time he had to take away from working impacted his sales and commissions.

Migraine headaches are rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100. Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks than for a 10 percent rating. A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability and is the highest schedular rating under this code.

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 252 (2018). This renders 38?C.F.R. §§?4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252.

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used in the criteria corresponding to 10 percent and 30 percent ratings under Diagnostic Code 8100 to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The rating criteria for a 50 percent rating contain several undefined phrases. The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253. The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id.  The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." Id. (internal citation omitted). Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?440, 445-46 (2004). In rating headaches or migraines under Diagnostic Code 8100, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

In addition to the lay evidence discussed above, there is medical evidence pertinent to the service-connected migraines disability. During VA treatment in January 2021, the Veteran reported getting about two headaches a day, three to four times a week, which were moderate in intensity and accompanied by nausea and light sensitivity but no vomiting. He indicated that his headaches worsen with computer screen and that he used a glare protector. He reported taking medication to alleviate pain and wanted to try preventive medications. He was assessed with chronic headaches and was to start Topamax and Imitrex.

The Veteran underwent a VA headache disability DBQ in March 2021. He reported that his migraines had gotten worse and that he was unable to concentrate for long periods of time. Current treatment was Excedrin migraine as needed and daily Sumatriptan. Symptoms included pulsating or throbbing head pain; pain localized to one side of the head; and sensitivity to light. Typical head pain lasted one to two days and was located on the right side of his head. The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain or very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. The examiner noted, however, that the Veteran's migraines impacted his ability to work and that he had lost one to two weeks of time in last 12 months and had residuals of migraines limitation in the form of an inability to concentrate for longer than 20 minutes without experiencing headache on right side of head and sensitivity to light. 

The Veteran underwent another VA headache disability DBQ in February 2022. Current symptoms included headache on right side of head and sensitivity to light. Current treatment was unchanged from the prior examination. He reported his migraines had gotten worse and he was unable to concentrate for long periods of time. Symptoms included pulsating or throbbing head pain, pain localized to one side of the head, and sensitivity to light. The pain lasted one to two days and was located on the right side of his head. It was reported that he had lost one to two weeks of time at work in the last 12 months. Residuals of migraines limitation were reported as an inability to concentrate for longer than 20 minutes without experiencing headache on the right side of the head and sensitivity to light. Non-headache symptoms associated with the headaches were nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. The examiner reported characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain with less frequent attacks but no very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability. The examiner also noted that the Veteran's headache disability impacts his ability to work in the form of decreased endurance of attention during headaches due to pain, decreased quality of work output during headaches due to pain, and impaired concentration during headaches due to light and sound sensitivity. 

A third VA headache disability DBQ was conducted in May 2023. The Veteran stated that his headaches had increased in frequency and severity and that the efficacy of the medications he is on is beginning to decrease as his headaches are harder to get rid of and occur more frequently than previously reported. Current treatment remained the same and in describing the impact of the condition on his ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities, the Veteran indicated that he was unable to concentrate for long periods of time. Symptoms included pulsating or throbbing head pain that lasted one to two days and was located on both sides of the head, worse with physical activity. Non-headache symptoms associated with headaches included sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and changes in vision (such as scotoma, flashes of light, tunnel vision). The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine/non-migraine headache pain or completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain. It was noted that the headaches impacted the Veteran's ability to work because he was unable to concentrate for longer than 20 minutes without experiencing headache on right side of head and sensitivity to light; that he had had to take some time off of work previously for headache symptoms; and that he had difficultly carrying out activities and going outside when pain is bad.

VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran contacted VA in July 2023 seeking to refill his prescription for Sumatriptan because although it was a temporary relief at the time he took it, his migraines were becoming worse and unbearable.

Considering all relevant lay and medical evidence of record, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that throughout the appeal period going back to February 1, 2021, the migraines more nearly approximated very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability corresponding to the criteria for a 50 percent (maximum schedular) rating under Diagnostic Code 8100. This determination is based on the Veteran's assertions made in written statements and during treatment and examination, discussed in detail above. The Veteran is now in receipt of the maximum schedular disability rating of 50 percent that is provided under Diagnostic Code 8100 for headaches for the entire initial rating period on appeal.

Earlier Effective Date Claims

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 2, 2021, for the grant of a TDIU.

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows that the Veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience, by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. Id. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

Marginal employment is not considered to be substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Marginal employment generally shall be deemed to exist when a Veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. Marginal employment may also be held to exist on a facts-found basis when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Id. This includes, but is not limited to, employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop. Id. 

The law provides that a total disability rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when the person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 

Unless otherwise specified, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase is to be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for a TDIU claim is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for TDIU is the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The effective date for TDIU is governed by the effective date provisions for increased ratings of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

Under the modernized review system, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim by the AOJ, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing any one of the following: (1) a supplemental claim; (2) a request for higher-level review; or (3) an appeal to the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1).

The Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU was received on February 17, 2022. See VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. Entitlement to a TDIU was established in a September 2022 rating decision effective August 2, 2021, the date following the Veteran's last day of employment based on the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric, left shoulder, left knee, skin, sleep apnea, and migraines disabilities. 

The Veteran has continuously pursued the effective date assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. The Board must consider whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date going back to February 1, 2021, as the claim for a TDIU was raised in connection with the pending claim for an increased rating for migraines.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

With the Board's grant of an initial 50 percent rating for migraines effective February 1, 2021, the Veteran is now in receipt of a combined 100 percent schedular rating as of that date. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. The receipt of a 100 percent schedular rating does not necessarily render moot a claim for TDIU, as a separate award of TDIU predicated on a single disability may serve as the basis for an award of special monthly compensation. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1114. 

The Veteran asserts that an earlier effective date no later than March 1, 2021, should be assigned for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU. The crux of his argument is that although he was able to secure employment as an insurance agent for American Income Life as of that date, he was not able to maintain that employment such that he is entitled to a TDIU. The Veteran contends that his work from March 2021 to August 2021 should be considered a failed work attempt due to the severity of his service-connected conditions rather than an indication of him being able to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment. See statement received October 27, 2022; statement received March 3, 2023; statement received December 5, 2023.

The VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, received on February 17, 2022, seeks entitlement to a TDIU based on the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, sleep apnea, pseudofolliculitis barbae with scars, tinnitus, left shoulder disability, and left knee disabilities. He lists November 3, 2013, as the date his disability affected full-time employment and August 1, 2021, as the date he last worked full-time and became too disabled to work. The Veteran indicated that he had completed one year of college and had worked at VA through the vocational rehabilitation program from March 2019 until March 2021, losing one day a week to disability and earning $1,556 per month; and at American Income Life as an insurance agent from March 2021 until August 2021, earning $1,100 per month. The Veteran indicated that he had left his last job because of disability and that he had not had any education or training before or since becoming too disabled to work. 

In an affidavit also received on February 17, 2022, the Veteran reports that his migraines and PTSD have impacted his ability to work. He asserts that he cannot handle office lighting and that he becomes confrontational and argumentative if something sets him off.

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id. 

An award of a TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Veteran, who completed one year of college, has not been able to maintain employment in the one year period prior to when his claim for entitlement to a TDIU was received, despite participating in VA's vocational rehabilitation program. Although an August 23, 2021, letter indicates that he had successfully maintained employment as an insurance sales agent at American Income Life for at least 60 days as of April 26, 2021, the Veteran has reported that he ceased employment with that company on August 1, 2021, and his earnings per month as reported in the VA Form 21-8940 were marginal. The Board finds that the Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation is impacted by the mental and physical effects of his service-connected disabilities. 

Given the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities have precluded the ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, skills, training, and work history throughout the period on appeal. Accordingly, an effective date of February 1, 2021, and no earlier, is warranted for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU. 

The Board has considered whether entitlement to SMC is warranted in this case. To establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), the evidence must show that a veteran has a single service-connected disability evaluated as 100 percent disabling and an additional service-connected disability, or disabilities, evaluated as 60 percent or more disabling that is separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, the veteran has a single service-connected disability evaluated as 100 percent disabling and due solely to service-connected disability or disabilities, the Veteran is permanently and substantially confined to his immediate premises. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The Court has emphasized that a TDIU premised on a single disability may satisfy the requirements for entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Bradley v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 249-250 (2010).

In this case, since the Board's grant of an effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU is not premised on a single disability, but rather, his service-connected disabilities in combination; thus, entitlement to SMC is not warranted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 2, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35.

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a), 21.3021.

Regarding the Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to August 2, 2021, for the grant of basic eligibility to Chapter 35 educational benefits, the Board finds that pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the Veteran was found to have a permanent total service-connected disability given the Board's assignment of an earlier effective date of February 1, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU.

In general, effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of Title 38 U.S.C. or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In sum, the Veteran was found to have a permanent total service-connected disability given the Board's grant of entitlement to a TDIU effective February 1, 2021. Therefore, entitlement to basic eligibility for Chapter 35 educational benefits must also be effective February 1, 2021.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
