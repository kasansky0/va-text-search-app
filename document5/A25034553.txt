Entitlement to an evaluation for patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia of the left knee, limitation of extension, greater than 0 percent is denied.

Entitlement to an evaluation for patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia of the left knee, limitation of flexion, is granted to 20 percent, but no higher, as of March 21, 2022.

Entitlement to an evaluation for surgical scarring, left knee, greater than 0 percent is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's PTSD manifest as total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene, disorientation to time or place, and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

2. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's eye condition manifest as visual acuity of 5 / 200 in the left eye and 20 / 40 in the right eye, with an average concentric contraction of 5 degrees visual field for the left eye and a concentric contraction between 46- and 60-degrees visual field for the right eye, with no incapacitating episodes.

3. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's left knee patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia limitation of extension, manifest as extension limited to 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, or 45 degrees.

4. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's left knee patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia, limitation of flexion, do not meet the applicable diagnostic criteria for a compensable rating; however, the evidence is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal that additional functional loss due to symptoms, including pain, more nearly approximate the criteria associated with a 20 percent evaluation. 

5. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's left knee scar manifests as a burn scar, a scar or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, a deep or nonlinear scar, an unstable or painful scar, a scar with other disabling effects, or a superficial and linear scar having a total surface area of 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters or more.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 2010 to February 2014.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Following July 2023 claims for increase and a December 2023 rating decision, this timely appeal of the denials followed. 

In the notice of disagreement, the Veteran selected the Direct Review option. As a result, the Board's decision on this appeal must be based exclusively on evidence already of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal was issued.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Any evidence added to the record after the rating decision on appeal was issued may be resubmitted along with a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), however, and if that evidence is new and relevant, it will be considered when the claim is readjudicated.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Instructions concerning supplemental claims are included with this decision.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed and carefully considered the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision. However, in this decision the Board's focus is on the specific issues at hand and the items of evidence material to resolving those issues. Therefore, failure to reference a particular item of evidence should not be interpreted as an indication it was not reviewed and considered, but rather that it did not significantly affect the outcome of the appeal. See Timberlake v. Gober,14 Vet. App. 122, 129 (2000); Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81(Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F. 4th 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2023). 

The matters are now before the Board for consideration. 

Evaluation of Disabilities Background

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

If the criteria and the facts are such that two different ratings are potentially applicable to the disability in question, the lower of those ratings must be assigned unless the veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

However, in keeping with the VA's overarching pro-veteran approach to claim adjudication, if there is any reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability, that doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Specifically, when adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  The core of this standard is the benefit of the doubt doctrine.

In making findings and rendering decisions, the Board employs a balancing test of positive and negative evidence. When they are approximately balanced or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine entitles the veteran to the benefit of the doubt, and the Board finds in the veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 131, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  

Conversely, if the Board finds the evidence tending to disprove a fact or claim predominates to the point the overall evidentiary picture is persuasively against the veteran, reasonable doubt is extinguished, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the Board finds accordingly.  See, e.g., Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

If the severity of a disability fluctuates over time, the VA may assign multiple ratings to cover different periods. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Breland v. McDonough, 22 F.4th 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2022). See also, O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 93 (2007) (assigning multiple ratings is a "sensible mechanism" for ensuring precision while simultaneously accounting for the "dynamic nature" of a disability). This process is commonly referred to as "staging" the ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

When staging ratings, the VA considers the evidence pertaining to the entire period on appeal, assigns a rating to reflect the level of disability for each distinct period, and then assigns the effective dates for each rating. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 127; Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. The effective date of a staged rating generally corresponds to the date that level of disability initially became evident. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

1. Entitlement to an evaluation for PTSD greater than 70 percent.

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for PTSD in a May 2022 rating decision, with an initial evaluation of 70 percent.  A claim for increase was denied in December 2023.  The Veteran continues to seek a 100 percent rating.

The Veteran's PTSD was evaluated using 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Schedule of ratings - mental disorders, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  According to the Formula, a 70 percent rating is for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  

A 100 percent rating is for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  See id.

When adjudicating psychiatric claims, the Board has an obligation to conduct a three-part "holistic" analysis: 1) assess the "severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms" of the Veteran's condition; 2) quantify "the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms;" and 3) assign an "evaluation that most closely approximates that level of occupational and social impairment."  See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); see also Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (2013) (holding that the disability rating schedule for psychiatric disabilities reflects "objectively-observable symptomatology," and "it is the severity of the effects of the symptoms as described by the examiner that determines the rating.").  The listed symptoms are not exhaustive but "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating."  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  

According to Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017), "[T]he language of the regulation indicates that the presence of suicidal ideation alone, that is, a veteran's thoughts of his or her own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas."  See Bankhead, supra at 19.  The Court in Bankhead continued:

[F]ailure to differentiate between [] suicidal ideation, which VA generally considers indicative of a 70% evaluation, and his risk of self-harm, the persistent danger of which VA generally considers indicative of a 100% evaluation, resulted in conflation of distinct concepts, prevented the veteran from understanding the Board's weighing of that evidence, and frustrated judicial review.

See Bankhead, supra at 22.  Assessing the "severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms" of the Veteran's condition and quantifying "the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms," the Veteran reports trouble falling asleep and nightmares "most nights," except when he has custody of his son.  The Veteran also reported flashbacks triggered by loud noises and smells of fire.  Despite reports of anxiety and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, the Veteran maintains a relationship with his stepfather and 3 siblings, adding, "we talk, get along."  He also described "friends," despite not going out much, playing video games, and spending time with his son.  The Veteran reported employment in hospital security since June 2020.  Before that, he worked at Disneyland, until he was laid off due to the COVID pandemic.  See February 2022 VA Primary Care Note, March 2022 VA Mental Health Note, April 2022 VA Initial PTSD examination report, May 2022 VA Psychiatry Note, and July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

The Veteran was not observed to have any difficulty with personal grooming or self-care, including appropriate attire.  Communication, including eye contact, attention, and concentration, was appropriate.  He was alert and oriented, with no evidence of motor disturbance or fluctuation of consciousness, and recent / remote memory seemed to be intact.  Thought processes were intact, linear, and logical, with no hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions.  See February 2022 VA Primary Care Note, March 2022 VA Mental Health Note, April 2022 VA Initial PTSD examination report, May 2022 VA Psychiatry Note, and July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

Regarding the assignment of an "evaluation that most closely approximates that level of occupational and social impairment," the Board finds sufficient frequency and impairment due to symptoms of an acquired psychiatric disorder continue to warrant an evaluation of 70 percent.  See July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

Conclusion

In summary, the Board recognizes that the Veteran's mental health condition significantly interferes with his ability to function, but that is why he has the relatively high rating 0f 70 percent. See, e.g., Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) ("A high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment"). 

Here, the medical evidence of record demonstrates gainful employment and relationships with family and friends, does not demonstrate that the Veteran is of such limited occupational and social impairment as to associate his symptoms with the criteria in a 100 percent evaluation.  The Board finds that a 70 percent disability rating adequately contemplates the symptoms of the Veteran's major depressive disorder.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the overall disability picture demonstrated by the record to arrive at the appropriate evaluation in this case.  

The Board has not overlooked the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his PTSD, but it does not establish the level of impairment associated with a 100 percent rating for this disability.  The evidence is persuasively against the increase, and thus, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

This appeal is denied, but the Veteran is reminded going forward if he believes his symptoms have worsened to a degree warranting a 100 percent rating, he may file a new claim for an increased rating. Additionally, if within one year of this decision he provides new and relevant evidence with a supplemental claim indicating he was in fact entitled to a 100 percent rating at the time of his previous claim, the date of his previous claim will apply for purposes of the effective date of any increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2024) (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).

2. Entitlement to an evaluation for bilateral retinal detachment with loss of visual field and left eye post operative cataract greater than 60 percent.

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for his eye condition in September 2014, with an initial rating of 40 percent.  An increase to 50 percent was granted in January 2018, and an increase to 60 percent was granted in May 2022.  An additional claim for increase was denied in December 2023.  The Veteran continues to seek an increased rating.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.75, General considerations for evaluating visual impairment, "The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function."  Examinations must be conducted by a licensed optometrist or ophthalmologist.  If only one eye is service connected due to visual impairment, the visual acuity of the other eye will be considered to be 20 / 40 for purposes of evaluating visual impairment of the service-connected eye.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.75.

Examination of visual acuity must include the central uncorrected and corrected visual acuity for distance and near vision using Snellen's test type or its equivalent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.76.

To determine the appropriate evaluation of visual fields, calculate the average concentric contraction of the visual field of each eye by measuring the remaining visual field (in degrees) at each of eight principal meridians 45 degrees apart, adding them, and dividing the sum by eight.  When both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, separately evaluate the visual acuity and visual field defect (expressed as a level of visual acuity) and combine them using the combined ratings table in 38 C.F.R. § 4.25 to arrive at the appropriate evaluation for visual impairment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.77.

The Veteran's visual acuity was assessed using 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Schedule of ratings - eye, Diagnostic Code 6065, Vision in one eye 5 / 200 (1.5 / 60).  According to Diagnostic Code 6065, a 30 percent evaluation is for 20 / 40 (1 / 12) vision in the other eye, a 40 percent evaluation is applied for 20 / 50 vision (6 / 15) in the other eye, a 50 percent evaluation is appropriate for 20 / 70 vision (6 / 21) in the other eye, a 60 percent evaluation is assigned for 20 / 100 vision (6 / 30) in the other eye, a 70 percent evaluation is awarded for 20 / 200 vision (6 / 60) in the other eye, an 80 percent evaluation is bestowed for 15 / 200 vision (4.5 / 60) in the other eye, a 90 percent evaluation is given for 10 / 200 vision (3 / 60) in the other eye, and a 100 percent evaluation is provided for 5 / 200 vision (1.5 / 60) in the other eye.  Special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 may be awarded where vision is 5 / 200 in both eyes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6065. 

Field of vision was assessed using 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Schedule of ratings - eye, Diagnostic Code 6080, Visual field defects.  According to Diagnostic Code 6080, concentric contraction of visual field, a 10 percent rating is for remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees, unilaterally or bilaterally, or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 50 (6 / 15), a remaining field of 31 to 45 degrees is 30 percent for bilateral and 10 percent for unilateral, or evaluate each affected eye as 20  70 (6 / 21), a remaining field of 16 to 30 degrees is 50 percent for bilateral and 10 percent for unilateral, or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 100 (6 / 30), a remaining field of 6 to 15 degrees is 70 percent for bilateral and 20 percent for unilateral, or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 200 (6 / 60), and a remaining field of 5 degrees is 100 percent for bilateral and 30 percent for unilateral, or evaluate each affected eye at 5 / 200 (1.5 / 60), and consider special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6080.

Additional criteria under Diagnostic Code 6080 includes a 10 percent rating for loss of superior half of visual field, bilaterally or unilaterally, or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 50 (6 / 15).  Loss of inferior half of visual field is 30 percent for bilateral and 10 percent for unilateral or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 70 (6 / 21).  Loss of nasal half of visual field is 10 percent, bilaterally or unilaterally, or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 50 (6 / 15).  Loss of temporal half of visual field is 30 percent bilateral and 10 percent unilateral or evaluate each affected eye as 20 / 70 (6 / 21).  Homonymous hemianopsia is rated at 30 percent.  See id.

Other potential diagnostic codes for application to the Veteran's eye conditions include Diagnostic Code 6008, Detachment of retina, Diagnostic Code 6027, Cataract, and Diagnostic Code 6029, Aphakia or dislocation of crystalline lens.  The Veteran does not have aphakia, which is required for application of Diagnostic Code 6027, Cataract, and Diagnostic Code 6008, Detachment of retina, requires the application of General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.  The Formula is based on "incapacitating episodes," defined as "an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes."  

In reviewing the Veteran's treatment history for his eye conditions, he does not meet the requirements for a compensable evaluation under the Formula.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31 ("In every instance where the Rating Schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.").

Calculating the appropriate evaluation for visual impairment, visual acuity is 20 / 40 in the "other," here, the right, non-visually impaired, eye.  See July 2023 VA Eye Conditions examination report.  Using Diagnostic Code 6065, a 30 percent evaluation is assessed.  Visual field shows an average concentric contraction of 5 degrees for the left eye, for which a 30 percent evaluation is assessed.  The right eye shows a concentric contraction with a remaining visual field between 46 and 60 degrees, for which a 10 percent evaluation is assessed.  See July 2023 VA Eye Conditions examination report.  Adding 30 percent for the left eye and 10 percent for the right eye, the Veteran's visual field is assessed at 40 percent.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.77(b).  

Using the combined ratings table in 38 C.F.R. § 4.25, a 40 percent evaluation on the vertical column on the far left intersects a 30 percent evaluation in the top row at the number "58," which is rounded up to provide a 60 percent evaluation for the Veteran's visual impairment due to his eye conditions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  

Conclusion

Simply put, the Veteran's visual acuity during the period on appeal merits nothing higher than a 60 percent rating using any relevant diagnostic code-even if the Veteran's left eye was functionally missing or able to perceive no more than light, under Diagnostic Code 6063 and 6064 his right eye would have to be limited to 20 / 200 vision for him to qualify for a rating higher than 60 percent, whereas his right eye vision was actually measured at 20 / 40. The Board also notes the Veteran reports that he is "constantly dealing with migraines and eye pain," but the Board is already being compensated for headaches with the maximum 50 percent rating for those symptoms.  See September 2023 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

The evidence is persuasively against the increase, and thus, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

This appeal is denied.  If the visual acuity in the Veteran's right eye deteriorates in the future, he may be entitled to a higher rating on that basis, and should file a claim for an increased rating along with the supporting evidence. Additionally, if within one year of this decision he provides new and relevant evidence with a supplemental claim indicating he was in fact entitled to a higher rating at the time of his previous claim, the date of his previous claim will apply for purposes of the effective date of any increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun, 37 Vet. App. at 103 (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).

3. Entitlement to an evaluation for patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia of the left knee, limitation of extension, greater than 0 percent.

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for his left knee limited extension in a May 2022 rating decision with a noncompensable evaluation.  His claim for an increased evaluation was denied in a December 2023 rating decision.  He is seeking a compensable evaluation.

Evaluation criteria for the knee are found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Schedule of ratings - musculoskeletal system and include Diagnostic Codes: 1) 5256, Knee, ankylosis of; 2) 5257, Knee, other impairment of; 3) 5258, Cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint; 4) 5259, Cartilage, semilunar, removal of, symptomatic; 5) 5260, Leg, limitation of flexion of; 6) 5261, Leg, limitation of extension of; 7) 5262, Tibia and fibula, impairment of; and 8) 5263, Genu recurvatum.  There is no evidence in the record of dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, tibial or fibular impairment, meniscal conditions, or surgical procedures for anything more than a dislocation; therefore, the Board will not discuss these symptoms and their associated diagnostic codes any further.

According to Diagnostic Code 5261, a noncompensable rating is given for extension limited to 5 degrees, a 10 percent evaluation is provided for extension limited to 10 degrees, a 20 percent evaluation is appropriate for extension limited to 15 degrees, a 30 percent evaluation is awarded for extension limited to 20 degrees, a 40 percent evaluation is given for extension limited to 30 degrees, and a 50 percent evaluation is assigned for extension limited to 45 degrees.  Under Diagnostic Code 5261, a 50 percent evaluation is the maximum possible schedular rating.  

The evaluation criteria of Diagnostic Code 5261 were not altered in conjunction with February 7, 2021, amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5261.

Applying the potential rating criteria to the Veteran's left knee condition, he does not meet the criteria for a compensable rating at any point during the period on appeal.  See April 2022 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination report ("Extension endpoint (0 degrees): 5 degrees") and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination report ("Extension endpoint (0 degrees): 0 degrees").  Despite the lack of demonstrated limitation of extension at the November 2023 VA examination, including as due to repeated use over time and flare-ups, the Board will not disturb the favorable findings of a VA adjudicator.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 3.104.

Chavis and Functional Ankylosis Due to Functional Loss

According to Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021), "[T]he requirement of ankylosis in VA's General Rating Formula...38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (2020), can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare."  See Chavis, supra at 2.  According to Chavis, "Sections 4.40 and 4.45 apply when evaluating joint condition severity for the present of the functional equivalence of ankylosis."  

Further, "[A] veteran may be entitled to a higher evaluation where there is evidence that his or her disability causes additional functional loss - i.e., 'the inability...to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' - including as due to pain...Additionally, a higher evaluation may also be awarded where there is a reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination."  See Chavis, supra at 10.

The Court in Chavis further noted, "Evaluation of a veteran's musculoskeletal disability under either of these methods, colloquially known as the DeLuca factors, is based on additional functional loss with use or during flare-ups, which should, if feasible, be portrayed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion lost."  See Chavis, supra at 10 (quoting from Deluca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995)).  

The court also noted in Chavis, "Although in the past we have focused on application of the DeLuca factors in the context of limitation of motion, nothing in those regulations or our caselaw suggests that those factors should not apply in the context of ankylosis...The provisions of §§ 4.40 and 4.45 are for application when evaluating joint disabilities and their manifestations, which may include ankylosis.  Notably, § 4.45 directs adjudicators to identify certain considerations when evaluating joint disabilities...And it specifically identifies ankylosis among the possible causes of less movement."  See Chavis, supra at 10-11.

Applying the precepts of Chavis, the Board does not find that the Veteran experiences the functional equivalent of ankylosis with repeated use over time or during flare-ups.  Therefore, the Board does not need to discuss the issue further.  See April 2022 and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  

Conclusion

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.307(b), the Board gives the Veteran's lay evidence its due consideration in evaluating his claim for an increased rating.  In doing so, the Board has not overlooked the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his knee condition.  

In summary, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran meets the relevant diagnostic criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5256-5263 for a compensable rating at any point during the period on appeal.

The Board has carefully considered all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, to include 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, and 4.59 concerning functional loss due to pain, as well as the holding in DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995), regarding functional loss attributable to pain, and Chavis, supra, regarding functional ankylosis.  

The evidence also contemplates the Veteran's descriptions of any symptoms in treatment, including reports of pain and functional loss.  The lay testimony has been considered together with the probative medical evidence clinically evaluating the severity of the pertinent disability symptoms.

The Board finds that the functional residuals of limited knee extension in the Veteran most closely approximate the criteria associated with a 0 percent rating.  Therefore, an increase is not warranted. The evidence is persuasively against the increase, and thus, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

This appeal is denied. However, if the Veteran's disability becomes more severe in the future, he may be entitled to a higher rating on that basis, and should file a claim for an increased rating along with the supporting evidence. 

Additionally, if within one year of this decision he provides new and relevant evidence with a supplemental claim indicating he was in fact entitled to a higher rating at the time of his previous claim, the date of his previous claim will apply for purposes of the effective date of any increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun, 37 Vet. App. at 103 (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).        

4. Entitlement to an evaluation for patellofemoral syndrome and chondromalacia of the left knee, limitation of flexion, greater than 10 percent.

Analysis

The Veteran was awarded service connection for limited flexion of the left knee in a September 2014 rating decision, with an initial evaluation of 10 percent.  A claim for increase was denied in May 2022 and again in December 2023.  The Veteran continues to seek an increased evaluation.

Evaluation criteria for the knee are found in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Schedule of ratings - musculoskeletal system and include Diagnostic Codes: 1) 5256, Knee, ankylosis of; 2) 5257, Knee, other impairment of; 3) 5258, Cartilage, semilunar, dislocated, with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint; 4) 5259, Cartilage, semilunar, removal of, symptomatic; 5) 5260, Leg, limitation of flexion of; 6) 5261, Leg, limitation of extension of; 7) 5262, Tibia and fibula, impairment of; and 8) 5263, Genu recurvatum.  There is no evidence in the record of dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, tibial or fibular impairment, meniscal conditions, or surgical procedures for anything more than a dislocation; therefore, the Board will not discuss these symptoms and their associated diagnostic codes any further.

According to Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is given for flexion limited to 60 degrees, a 10 percent evaluation is provided for flexion limited to 45 degrees, a 20 percent evaluation is appropriate for flexion limited to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent evaluation is awarded for flexion limited to 15 degrees.  Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a 30 percent evaluation is the maximum possible schedular rating.  The evaluation criteria of Diagnostic Code 5260 were not altered in conjunction with February 7, 2021, amendments to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

Applying the potential rating criteria to the Veteran's left knee condition, he does not meet the criteria for a compensable rating at any point during the period on appeal.  See June 2014, April 2022, and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  Because the Veteran did not meet the minimum evaluation criteria for a compensable rating under any of the potentially applicable diagnostic codes, he was provided with the "minimum compensable rating for the joint," as prescribed by 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, "Painful motion."  

Beyond entitlement "to at least the minimum compensable rating," the regulation offers several factors to consider in arriving at an evaluation for painful motion, including the presence of arthritis or sciatic neuritis, facial expression on pressure or manipulation, muscle spasm, painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, and crepitation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  

The evidence of record does not disclose osteoarthritis (or traumatic arthritis) that has been confirmed through x-ray imaging.  See June 2014, April 2022, and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  Crepitus is also noted at the November 2023 VA examination.  See June 2014, April 2022, and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.

In addition, the Board must consider additional functional loss due to symptoms such as deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, ankylosis, nonunion, weakness, premature or excess fatigability, and incoordination.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran experienced pain, productive of functional loss, upon flexion.  See June 2014, April 2022, and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  In this regard, "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria."  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  

In other words, the Board cannot consider the ameliorative effects of medication unless medication is referenced in the applicable diagnostic code.  As medication is not referenced in the applicable diagnostic codes, the Board must consider that his knee symptoms would be worse without the use of analgesics.  Indeed, the Veteran acknowledged the use of Ibuprofen, Tylenol, cortisone, and Synvisc to the April 2022 and November 2023 VA examiners.  See April 2022 and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  

An additional loss of range of motion was estimated due to either repeated use over time or flare-ups.  In addition, the Veteran reported functional loss due to "painful motion" and limitations on prolonged standing, walking, kneeling, squatting, and using stairs.  See April 2022 and November 2023 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions examination reports.  

He is competent to report the symptoms and impairment associated with his knee conditions during exacerbations of symptoms and following repetitive use.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  The Board finds the Veteran's statements credible.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  Moreover, the reported symptoms are relevant in determining "[i]nstability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, standing and weight-bearing."  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.45(f).

Based on the evidence of record, the Board can reasonably conclude that the painful motion and functional loss is equivalent to a flexion limited to 30 degrees.  See January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  However, the evidence of record weighs persuasively against approximation of the symptoms required for a rating greater than 20 percent. 

Conclusion

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.307(b), the Board gives the Veteran's lay evidence its due consideration in evaluating his claim for an increased rating.  In doing so, the Board has not overlooked the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his knee condition.  

The Board finds that the functional residuals of knee conditions in the Veteran most closely approximate the criteria associated with a 20 percent rating.  Therefore, an increase to 20 percent is warranted, and the Veteran's claim for increase is hereby granted to 20 percent, but no higher. 

A claim for an increased rating is a new claim separate and apart from the original claim for service connection.  Therefore, if the Board finds an increase in the veteran's disability rating is warranted, the effective date of the change will generally be the date the veteran filed the claim for an increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  

Because a claim for an increased disability rating based on a change in the severity of the disability is a new claim, the period on appeal begins with the filing of the claim, and ends with the issuing of the rating decision. 

However, unlike other types of claims, a claim for an increased rating based on a change in severity may have an effective date the predates the claim. The VA recognizes as a matter of practicality veterans generally cannot file a claim for an increased rating instantaneously upon realizing their symptoms or impairments have worsened. Therefore, the VA provides a one-year "grace period" for filing the claim after the worsening becomes "factually ascertainable." 

In other words, if the veteran files a claim within one year after worsening becomes factually ascertainable, the effective date of their increase is the date the worsening initially became factually ascertainable.  On the other hand, if the veteran waits longer than one year, they lose the benefit of the grace period, and the effective date of the increase is the date of the claim or the date of entitlement, whichever is later. 

When the claim on appeal is not the initial claim for the benefit sought, under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

Here, the Board finds there has been continuous pursuit of a higher rating since the filing of a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim received on March 21, 2022. However, the Board finds there is no evidence of factually ascertainable worsening prior to the filing of the claim. Therefore, the date of the claim governs the effective date of the increase.

A rating of 20 percent, but no higher, is therefore warranted as of March 21, 2022, but no earlier, and to that extent, this appeal is granted.         

5. Entitlement to an evaluation for surgical scarring, left knee, greater than 0 percent.

The Veteran was granted service connection for left knee scars in a July 2014 rating decision, with an initial rating of 0 percent.  Claims for increase were denied in May 2022 and December 2023.  He continues to seek a compensable rating.

The Veteran's scars were evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Schedule of ratings - skin, Diagnostic Code 7802, Burn scar(s), or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are superficial and nonlinear.  Under Diagnostic Code 7802, a 10 percent evaluation is for a total scar area of 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

Other potential rating criteria includes Diagnostic Code 7800, Burn scar(s) of the head, face, or neck; scar(s) of the head, face, or neck due to other causes; or other disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, Diagnostic Code 7801, Burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head face, or neck, that are deep and nonlinear, Diagnostic Code 7804, Scar(s), unstable or painful, are rated according to the following criteria, and Diagnostic Code 7805, Scars, other (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800-7805.

The Veteran's left knee scars are not due to burns, do not include scars or disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, are not deep or nonlinear scars, cannot be classified as unstable or painful scars, with frequent loss of covering, and do not include other disabling effects.  The diagnostic codes associated with these criteria will not be discussed further herein.

Applying the criteria of Diagnostic Code 7802, the Veteran does not meet the requirements for an increased rating at any point during the period on appeal.  As a scar that is superficial and linear, it does not have a total surface area of 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters or more.  See April 2022 and November 2023 VA Scars / Disfigurement examination reports ("Course of the condition since onset: [x] Stayed the same...Are any of the scars of the trunk or extremities painful?  [x] No...Are any of the scars of the trunk or extremities unstable, with frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar?  [x] No...Are any of the scars of the trunk or extremities due to burns?  [x] No...Scars with underlying tissue damage: [x] None...Summary of scar findings for the trunk and extremities: [x] Left lower extremity: Approximate total area: 9 sq cm."

Conclusion

In summary, the most probative evidence of record persuasively indicates that the Veteran does not meet the relevant diagnostic criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 for entitlement to an increased rating.  The Veteran's scars do not measure 144 square inches or 929 square centimeters or more in area.  The Veteran's disability does not present such an exceptional or unusual picture as to render the Rating Schedule impractical.  Therefore, consideration for extraschedular evaluation is not for application.  The Veteran is adequately compensated for the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases or injuries incurred in or aggravated by his active service in any civilian occupation.

The Board has carefully reviewed and considered the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of his left knee scars.  To that end, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran, in advancing this appeal, believes that the residuals of his left knee scars are more severe than is reflected in the assigned ratings.  The Board is likewise aware of the Veteran's contentions that his residuals of left knee scars impact his daily activities.  Moreover, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  

In this case, however, the competent medical evidence offering detailed, specific, and specialized determinations pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence regarding the evaluation of any pertinent symptoms for the disability on appeal.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).   The evidence also contemplates the Veteran's descriptions of his symptoms both at VA examinations and in treatment, including his reports of impairment with respect to pain.  The lay testimony has been considered together with the probative medical evidence clinically evaluating the severity of the pertinent disability symptoms. 

The medical evidence of record, including the VA examination reports, is the most probative evidence of record on the question of entitlement to an increased rating.  The VA examination reports are based on an extensive review of all the evidence, including lay statements from the Veteran, were supported by a detailed rationale, provided data to support any conclusions, and provided a clear and reasoned analysis, the source of the most probative value in a medical report.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.   

Requirements for increased ratings due to left knee scars are not based on subjective criteria, including the Veteran's belief about what evaluation may be appropriate.  Conclusory, generalized lay statements in favor of a claimed increase are insufficient to substantiate the relevant evaluation criteria.  For reasons that include a lack of probative value, the lay statements provided by the Veteran do not constitute evidence upon which an increase may be granted.

The medical evidence of record provides compelling evidence against the Veteran's claim for increase.  There is no competent, credible evidence to refute the medical record.  The evidence is persuasively against the increase, and thus, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.  Consequently, an increase is not warranted, and the appeal must be denied.  

Other Matters

Because this appeal revolves around an "attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability," the Board has considered whether it raises the issue of entitlement to a total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) in accordance with Rice v. Shinseki 22 Vet.App. 447, 453-54 (2009). 

The Board finds the Veteran's actual employment prior to being laid off for reasons unrelated to his service-connected disabilities is persuasive evidence that he was not entitled to a TDIU because his service-connected disabilities did not prevent him from securing or maintaining gainful employment. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 356 (2000). In addition, the Board notes that the Veteran has a 100 percent permanent and total combined disability rating as of July 2023.

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record with respect to his claim.  See Doucette, supra (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
