ORDER

The propriety of the withholding of VA compensation benefits to recoup active duty pay is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the adjudication of this matter on appeal, the matter was resolved by VA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the propriety of the withholding of VA compensation benefits to recoup active duty pay have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from December 2020 to May 2021.

This matter is on appeal from a March 2024 notification letter from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, in this case, evidence added to the Veteran's file after the March 2024 notification letter on appeal indicates this matter has been resolved.

Generally, pension, compensation, or retirement pay on account of any person's own service shall not be paid to such person for any period for which such person receives active service pay. See 38 U.S.C. § 5304(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700.

This includes active duty pay, drill, and active duty for training payments, and inactive duty for training payments made to Reservists and members of the National Guard. Id.  Reservists may waive their pension, compensation, or retirement pay for periods of field training, instruction, other duty, or drills; such waiver may include prospective periods and contain a right of recoupment for the days for which the reservist did not receive payment for duty by reason of failure to report for duty. 38 C.F.R. § 3.700 (a)(1)(iii).

An overpayment is created when VA determines that a beneficiary or payee has received monetary benefits in excess of the amount to which he or she was entitled. 38 C.F.R. § 1.962. Whenever the Secretary finds that an overpayment has been made to a veteran or eligible person, the amount of such overpayment shall constitute a liability of such veteran or eligible person to the United States. See Mountford v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 443, 450, n.6 (2011) (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 3685, 5314). To establish improper creation of an overpayment, i.e., an invalid debt, evidence must show that the Veteran was legally entitled to the VA compensation benefits at issue, or, if she was not legally entitled to these benefits, then it must be shown that VA was solely at fault for the erroneous payment of excess benefits.

In March 2024, VA sent the Veteran a notification letter that his VA compensation benefits would be stopped due to his return to active duty.

However, the Veteran reported that he did not in fact return to active duty and was just completing training.  In support of his contention, the Veteran submitted copies of his orders showing training days from March 7, 2024 to March 10, 2024.

In a June 2024 letter, VA indicated to the Veteran that based on this evidence, VA was correcting the mistake and adjusted to stop the Veteran's VA compensation benefits from March 7, 2024, the day he started his training, to March 10, 2024, the day his training ended.  Additionally, documents from August 2024 show the Veteran had been refunded money due to the error.

In this case, the dates the Veteran reported training and his military personnel files show now matches the same dates VA withheld compensation.  Evidence also shows VA returned the wrongfully withheld funds to the Veteran minus the applicable withholdings due to his training days from March 7, 2024 to March 10, 2024 for which the Veteran was not allowed to receive both training compensation and VA compensation.  As discussed above, this withholding was proper because the Veteran is not permitted to receive both types of compensation at the same time.  However, the dates the Veteran said he trained and the dates compensation was withheld by VA now match and all other monies have been returned to the Veteran.  Therefore, there remains no issue in controversy and the matter is dismissed.
