FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, for the appellate period from June 29, 2020 to August 12, 2020, he met the schedular threshold for a TDIU, and he was rendered unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service-connected disabilities.

2. Given the Board's award herein of an effective date of June 29, 2018, for the award of a TDIU, the Veteran is eligible for DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, effective June 29, 2018.

3. The Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for left knee strain with arthritis that was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs on February 8, 2022, culminating in an award of service connection for left knee strain with patellar instability and there is no earlier valid formal or informal pending claim of record.

4. The Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for left knee strain with arthritis that was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs on February 8, 2022, culminating in an award of service connection for left knee strain with semilunar cartilage and there is no earlier valid formal or informal pending claim of record.

5. For the period on appeal, the Veteran's left knee strain with arthritis manifested in pain and flexion, at worst, to 65 degrees during flare ups.

6. For the period on appeal, the Veteran's left knee strain with patellar instability manifested in recurrent patellar instability without surgical repair, which did not require use of a brace, cane, or walker prescribed by a medical provider.

7. For the period on appeal, the Veteran's left knee strain with semilunar cartilage manifested in symptomatic semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of locking, joint pain, and joint effusion, but without evidence of dislocation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of June 29, 2018, but not earlier, for the award of a TDIU are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.16(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service from June 1990 to July 1991, from July 1997 to August 1997, from April 1999 to August 1999, from October 2004 to February 2005, and from April 2006 to August 2006.  He also had several other periods of active service while in the National Guard.  The Veteran's first period of active-duty service has been characterized as under other than honorable, but the remaining periods are honorable.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision and January 2024 higher level review by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

The May 2023 rating decision: Granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective August 12, 2020; Granted an effective date of August 12, 2020 for DEA Chapter 35 benefits; Denied a disability rating higher than 10 percent for left knee strain with arthritis; Denied an effective date prior to November 25, 2020 for service connection for left knee strain with arthritis meniscus (semilunar cartilage); Denied an initial rating higher than 10 percent for left knee strain with patellar instability; Denied an effective date prior to February 8, 2022 for service connection for left knee strain with patellar instability; Identified clear and unmistakable error in assigning an initial 20 percent rating for left knee strain with semilunar cartilage and reduced the rating to 10 percent; and Denied an effective date prior to February 8, 2022 for service connection for left knee strain with semilunar cartilage.  The January 2024 higher level review rating decision denied higher ratings and earlier effective dates than those reflected in the May 2023 decision.

The March 2022 rating decision notes favorable findings that the Veteran had not worked since leaving his employment at Northern New Mexico Correctional Center in 2020 based on his social security earnings statement, and that his service connected disabilities meet the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU.  The May 2023 rating decision notes the favorable findings that the Veteran's service connected disabilities have met the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU since June 29, 2018, and that he has continuously pursued his TDIU claim since June 29, 2018.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings as they are not rebutted by clear and unmistakable error.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A.

In March 2024, the Veteran's attorney initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision for all issues except reduction of the rating for semilunar cartilage.  In April 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran and his attorney that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of May 19, 2023.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Although the May 2023 rating decision does not clearly delineate the issues adjudicated therein, the issues on appeal are correctly set forth in the title section, above.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009) (holding that the scope of a claim is determined by the claimant's description of the claim, the symptoms described, and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim).  

The Board notes that the May 2023 rating decision combines several issues that should be separately distinguished.  For clarity, the Board has characterized the issues as set forth in the title section, above.  Furthermore, the May 2023 rating decision mischaracterizes the issue of an earlier effective date for service connection for left knee arthritis with that of left knee semilunar cartilage and incorrectly notes the presently assigned effective date of November 25, 2020.  As explained in detail below, the presently assigned effective date for left knee arthritis is June 29, 2018 and the presently assigned effective date for left knee semilunar cartilage is February 8, 2022.

Motion for Advancement on Docket

Appeals to the Board, normally considered in docket order, may be advanced on the docket upon a showing of good cause, including severe financial hardship.  38?U.S.C. §?7107; 38?C.F.R. §?20.902.

Here, the record reflects that the Veteran suffers severe financial hardship, as asserted by the Veteran's attorney in the cover letter enclosed with the Veteran's March 2024 VA Form 10182.  Therefore, the Board grants advancement on the docket.  38?C.F.R. §?20.902(c)(1).

Preliminary Matter

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Effective Dates

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 19, 2020 for a TDIU

The Veteran, through his attorney, contends an earlier effective date is warranted for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU, indicating that he was last employed in 2016.  See, e.g., March 2024 Correspondence enclosing VA Form 10182.

A TDIU rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation resulting from a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Consistent with the record on appeal and the binding favorable findings in the May 2023 rating decision, the Veteran in this case has met the schedular percentage requirement for a TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) as of June 29, 2018, and he has continuously pursued his TDIU claim since June 29, 2018.

The effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim.  Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).  The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  An exception to that rule applies, however, under circumstances where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation.  In such an instance, the law provides that the effective date of the award "shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  Additionally, a claim for a TDIU is inferred in a claim for increase where the Veteran claims his disability(s) affects his employability or such a claim is reasonably raised by the record.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

However, when determining the appropriate effective date for an award of TDIU, the effective date cannot be earlier than the effective date of the award of service connection for the disability or disabilities upon which the award of a TDIU is predicated.  Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 232, 236 (2019).  As an award of TDIU must be based on a service-connected disability or disabilities, the effective date for the award of TDIU cannot, as a matter of logic, predate the effective date for the award of service connection for the disability or disabilities which result in the Veteran's inability to gain or maintain substantially gainful employment. Id. See also Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528, 534 (2008), Canady v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 393, 398 (2006).

In this case, during the period on appeal, the Veteran was service connected for PTSD with major depressive disorder with an assigned rating of 70 percent, effective June 29, 2018.  Thereafter, service connection was granted for left knee strain with arthritis, with an assigned rating of 10 percent, an effective June 29, 2018.  The Veteran, as reflected in his attorney's March 2024 appeal brief, asserts that he worked as a semi-tractor trailer truck driver from 2014 to 2016, and from 2016 he held only marginal employment.  "[T]he Veteran did not work at any of these jobs for longer than 12 months, nor did he earn more than the poverty threshold for a single person for any of the years during the appellate period in 2018, 2019, or 2020.  Therefore, his work after 2016 was not substantially gainful employment."  The attorney added that the Veteran, "worked for less than a year at several jobs from 2016 to 2020, and he was unable to maintain his employment in any position due to his PTSD and left knee arthritis" from 2018 through 2020.

The Veteran's argument is consistent with the Veteran's December 2021 Social Security Administration (SSA) earnings statement, which reflects earnings taxed for SSA purposes of $160 in 2018, no earnings in 2019, and $9,251 in 2020.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau Housing and Household Economics Statistics Division, the poverty threshold for one person under age 65 in 2018 was $13,064, in 2019 it was $13,300, and in 2020 it was $13,465.  Based on this information, it is indisputable that the Veteran's earnings in from 2018 to 2020 were below the poverty threshold for a single person under age 65. 

The October 2018 TDIU application reflects that the Veteran last worked full time in November 2017 when he became too disabled to work due to anger outbursts, irritability, difficulty interacting with and trusting people, and impaired sleep, and pain from his service-connected PTSD and left knee disabilities.  The Veteran listed his employment history as his military service from 1994 to 2015 and his education level as having completed high school and two years of college. 

During the January 2019 VA PTSD examination, the VA examiner identified the following symptoms: a depressed mood; anxiety; panic attacks more than once a week; near-continuous panic or depression affecting his ability to function independently and appropriately; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss; flattened affect, circumstantial, circumlocutory or stereotypical speech; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting; inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's PTSD caused occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and mood.

September 2018 VA treatment notes reflect the Veteran's endorsement of depression, and poor sleep with nightmares.  On examination, he was alert and oriented, but agitated at times and anxious, and his thought process was tangential.  December 2018 VA treatment notes reflect that the Veteran had a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, distressing memories and nightmares, and other than full concentration.

The January 2019 VA knee examination reflects pain from the Veteran's left knee strain.  Although knee x-rays were normal, the Veteran endorsed aching pain.  The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's left knee disability did not impact his ability to work.  Thereafter, the April 2019 VA knees examination reflects aching left knee pain.  The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's left knee disability did not impact his ability to work.

In a November 2019 addendum to the January 2019 VA PTSD examination, a VA examiner clarified the January 2019 examination finding that the Veteran's PTSD did not impact his ability to work was based on the Veteran not having been employed since 2016.

In his January 2021 TDIU claim, the Veteran identified his service-connected PTSD and left knee pain among the disabilities that had prevented him from working full time since October 2017.  He noted that he applied, unsuccessfully, for employment with a police department in October 2016.  The Veteran listed his employment history as his military service and his education level as having completed high school and one year of college. 

The Veteran's February 2022 TDIU application reflects the Veteran's assertion that his PTSD and left knee strain rendered him unable to work as of August 2020.  He listed full time employment as a security officer at a correctional facility from May 2020 to August 2020 with an income of approximately $3,000 per month, and an unsuccessful attempt in 2020 to obtain employment with the postal service.  The TDIU application also notes past part time employment with an automotive parts store and with a transport company as a furniture mover.  The Veteran's attorney argued that the Veteran's mental and physical limitations associated with his service-connected PTSD and left knee strain rendered the Veteran unable to maintain substantially gainful employment from June 2018, due to impaired memory and concentration, difficulties with mood, motivation, social interactions, and ability to handle stressful situation, as well as difficulties climbing, standing, walking, and bending.

Employment information received in November 2019 from the transport company the Veteran worked for reflects that the Veteran was employed by the company from April 2017 to September 2017.  Company representative A.T. completed the form, stating, described the position the Veteran held as packer/mover in a fast paced environment.  The representative said the Veteran was "unable to continue performance of required duties with or without reasonable accommodation."  The representative added that the Veteran's "back pain and knee pain as well as other pain caused him difficulty to stand, lift, and move quickly in the work environment."  The representative added that the Veteran's "irritability, aggression, and emotional distress and anger in the work environment" resulted in his being unable to control his anger at time, and therefore he was "unable to continue his position at our company."  See November 2019 VA Form 21-4192.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements of record as reflected in the TDIU applications, medical records, and VA examinations.? As discussed above, lay evidence is competent to report on matters that are capable of ordinary observation.? Layno, supra.? Here, the Veteran has competently described to clinicians and VA examiners how his service-connected PTSD and left knee disabilities have resulted in chronic pain and limited mobility.  Furthermore, in the VA Form 21-4192, transport company representative competently described how the Veteran's back and knee pain, as well as his inability to control his anger rendered him unable to continue performance of his duties as a packer/mover, regardless of reasonable accommodation.

Considering the Veteran's occupational and educational background along with the above-mentioned evidence, which indicates that his ability to work was impacted by the service-connected disorders, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that he was unable to secure or maintain any type of employment that is consistent with his employment and educational background during the period prior to August 2020.  See Ray, supra.?? The Veteran's active service involved military occupational specialties of Recovery Vehicle Operator and Patriot Missile Crewmember, and the record reflects that he attended only one or two years of college.? Based on the evidence of record, the Board is unable to conclude that a former military vehicle operator and missile crewmember, and civilian truck driver, automotive parts store employee, furniture mover, and security officer who is impaired by depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty with relationships and adapting to stressful situations as well as left knee pain due to his service-connected disabilities, would be able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation in this or a similar field as such occupations reasonably require a considerable amount of alertness, concentration, mobility, and endurance.? In?other words, the Veteran's limitations associated with his service-connected PTSD and left knee disabilities warrant a TDIU for the period on appeal prior to August 12, 2020.

The Board finds that, overall, the evidence in this case, at the very least is in relative equipoise as to whether the Veteran was unable to find and maintain substantially gainful employment prior to August 12, 2020.  Accordingly, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is applicable and entitlement to a TDIU is?warranted for the period prior to August 12, 2020, but no earlier, subject to the laws and regulations governing the payment of monetary benefits.? See 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 4.3, 4.16(a).?

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 19, 2020 for DEA Chapter 35 eligibility

Regarding the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the Veteran was awarded eligibility to DEA effective August 12, 2020, based upon the date the AOJ's grant of entitlement to a TDIU.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.  Subsection (b) provides that when determining the effective date of an award under Chapter 35 for an individual described in paragraph (b)(2) of 38 U.S.C. § 5113, based on an original claim, VA may consider the individual's application as having been filed on the eligibility date of the individual if that eligibility date is more than one year before the date of the initial rating decision. For these purposes, "eligibility date" means the date on which the individual became an eligible person as defined by 38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a)(1), and "initial rating decision" means a decision by VA that establishes the Veteran's total disability as permanent in nature. 38 U.S.C. § 5113(3).

As pertinent here, the conditions for basic eligibility for DEA include: (1) the Veteran's discharge from service under conditions other than dishonorable; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).  Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a).  Permanence of disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b).  The term "total disability permanent in nature" for the purpose of DEA benefits means any disability rated total for the purposes of disability compensation which is based on an impairment reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(7).

As the only method of eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits which is relevant to the Veteran is through having a permanent total service-connected disability, the effective date for DEA benefits is directly predicated on the effective date from which VA considered that the Veteran's permanent and total disability commenced for purposes of VA benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a)(iii), (p), (r).

In light of the Board's current finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to maintain gainful occupation and warranted entitlement to a TDIU since June 29, 2018, an effective date of June 29, 2018, for establishing eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits is also warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(a).

Entitlement to earlier effective dates for service connection for left knee arthritis, left knee patellar instability, and left knee semilunar cartilage

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection is the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38?U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The same is true for an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication, as VA laws and regulations stipulate that the effective date of such an award shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See Id.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r).

The effective date for service connection for a secondary disability cannot be earlier than the effective date of the disability upon which the secondary grant was based.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 49 (2010) (holding that "[i]t is axiomatic that there must be a primary service-connected condition for a claimant to establish entitlement to secondary service connection").

Here, the record on appeal reflects that a notice of intent to file a claim for compensation (ITF) was received on April 23, 2017.  VA correspondence dated April 24, 2017 notified the Veteran that he had one year from the date of filing the ITF to submit an application for benefits to preserve the April 23, 2017 filing date for benefit purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  The record does not reflect that the Veteran submitted an application for benefits within the one year period.

On June 29, 2018, VA received an ITF from the Veteran, and in October 2018, he submitted a claim for compensation seeking service connection for a knee condition.  A December 2019 rating decision deferred a decision as to entitlement for service connection for left knee arthritis pending receipt of a VA medical opinion.  A January 2020 rating decision, as pertinent here, granted service connection for left knee strain with arthritis, assigning a 10 percent disability rating effective June 29, 2018.

The earliest claim of record is the April 23, 2017 ITF.  However, as the record does not reflect that a formal claim followed within one year of receipt of the ITF, it cannot serve as the basis of an effective date.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  The June 29, 2018 ITF was timely followed by the filing in October 2018 of a formal claim for service connection for knee disabilities.  A December 2019 rating decision deferred adjudication of service connection, and in a January 2020 rating decision service connection for left knee strain with arthritis was granted, with an effective date of June 29, 2018, the earliest effective date possible.  38?U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under AMA, a?claimant has one year from notification of the rating decision to initiate an appeal to the Board and the rating decision becomes final if an appeal is not perfected within the one year period or new and relevant evidence is not received within that time period.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(d).  The Veteran did not appeal the January 2020 rating decision and new and relevant evidence was not submitted within the one year appeal period.  In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a new claim seeking an increased rating for his left knee, and he was afforded a VA examination in January 2021.  The AOJ denied the claim in an April 2021 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal the April 2021 rating decision and new and relevant evidence was not submitted within the one year appeal period.  While the November 2020 and February 2022 claims were received within one year of the January 2020 and April 2021 rating decisions, respectively, the mere filing of a new claim will not prevent the prior decision from becoming final absent receipt of new and relevant evidence.  See Akers v. Shinseki, 673 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2012); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  As such, the January 2020 and April 2021 rating decisions became final. Id.

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim on February 8, 2022, and in March 2022 rating decision granted service connection for left knee strain with patellar instability, assigning an initial 10 percent rating.  The March 2022 rating decision also granted service connection for left knee strain with dislocated semilunar cartilage, assigning an initial 20 percent rating.  The March 2022 rating decision was followed by the Veteran's April 2022 HLR request and the May 2023 HLR rating decision, which found clear and unmistakable error in regard to dislocation of left knee semilunar cartilage, corrected the characterization of the disability to semilunar cartilage, and assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective February 8, 2022.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the earliest possible effective date, June 29, 2018 has already been assigned for service connection for left knee strain with arthritis, as it is based on receipt of the Veteran's ITF on June 29, 2018, which was followed by the timely filing of a formal claim for compensation in October 2018 arguably identifying a knee disability and the January 2020 rating decision granting service connection for left knee strain with arthritis.  Regarding left knee patellar instability and semilunar cartilage, evidence of these disabilities was not of record until the March 2022 VA examination that was conducted in the development of the February 8, 2022 claim, which diagnosed left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage.  Thus, the appropriate effective date for both left knee strain with patellar instability and left knee strain with semilunar cartilage is the date of the claim that was pending at the time of the March 2022 diagnosis, February 8, 2022.

The Board recognizes that effective dates should not be assigned based solely on the date of diagnosis or examination.  Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).  Instead, all relevant facts should be considered to determine the date the disability first manifested.  DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011).  However, review of the Veteran's VA treatment records show that they are silent as to left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage, and the earliest evidence reflecting symptoms of left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage is reflected in the March 2022 VA examination report.  Therefore, the February 8, 2022 effective date assigned by the AOJ is appropriate.

The Board has reviewed all relevant evidence and finds no basis under the law to award an effective date earlier than February 8, 2022 for the grant of service connection for left knee strain arthritis, left knee strain with patellar instability, or left knee strain with semilunar cartilage.  Significantly, the relevant regulation provides that any award of benefits can be made effective no earlier than the date of the new application, here February 8, 2022.  Additionally, no correspondence was received from the Veteran mentioning the left knee arthritis and/or indicating an intent to apply for service connection prior to June 29, 2018.  Regarding left knee patellar instability and semilunar cartilage, no correspondence was received from the Veteran mentioning either disability and/or indicating an intent to apply for service connection between the issuance of the April 2021 rating decision and the February 8, 2022 claim seeking an increased rating for left knee strain with arthritis.

With respect to the date of claim, effective March 24, 2015, VA regulations mandate that a specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under VA law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 5101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.151.

The Board considered whether any evidence of record dated prior to June 29, 2018 may be construed as a claim, formal or informal, for service connection for a left knee disability.  However, in this case, there is no document of record earlier than the currently assigned effective date that may reasonably be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for left knee strain with arthritis.

Likewise, the Board considered whether any evidence of record dated prior to February 8, 2022 may be construed as a claim, formal or informal, for service connection for left knee patellar instability or left knee semilunar cartilage.  However, in this case, there is no document of record earlier than the currently assigned effective date that may reasonably be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for left knee patellar instability or left knee semilunar cartilage.

Even if there were evidence of left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage prior to the assigned effective date, the claim would still fail because the mere existence or even receipt of medical records does not establish that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection.  Where a claimant has not previously been granted service connection, VA's receipt of medical records cannot be construed as an informal claim.  Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999).  VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed and the mere presence of medical evidence that a veteran suffers from a disability does not establish intent on the part of the veteran to seek service connection for that disability.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34, 35 (1998).  Further, the Federal Circuit Court has held that the mere mention of a condition in a medical record, alone, cannot be construed as a claim for service connection.  See MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.157.  As set out above, the relevant regulation requires that a claim, or at least some application that reasonably viewed can be considered a claim, be filed.  Here, there was no such claim prior to the currently assigned effective date of February 8, 2022.

The Board acknowledges the contention by the Veteran that earlier effective dates are warranted for service connection for his service-connected left knee disabilities.  However, under applicable law, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  As such, the AOJ has already assigned the earliest possible effective dates for its grant of service connection, correctly determined to be June 29, 2018 for left knee strain with arthritis, the date of receipt of the ITF, and February 8, 2022, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim for compensation.  See Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2005); Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Consequently, there is no legal basis upon which to grant an effective date prior to February 8, 2022 for the grant of service connection for left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage.  The Board is bound by the law governing the assignment of effective dates in its determination in this case.  See 38?U.S.C. §?7104(c).  Accordingly, the claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 8, 2022 for the award of service connection for left knee patellar instability and left knee semilunar cartilage associated with left knee strain with arthritis must be denied.

Increased Rating Claims - Applicable Laws and Regulations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.  See Esteban, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

The Board notes that, whether or not arthritis is present, painful motion should be considered to determine whether a separate or higher rating is warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which provides that the Rating Schedule is meant to allow for at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint to recognize actually painful, unstable or malaligned joints, due to healed injury.  Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, evaluation of the medical evidence since the grant of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged rating" (assignment of different ratings for distinct periods of time, based on the facts found) is required.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

Where an increase in the level of a service-connected disability is at issue, the primary concern is the present level of disability.  Francisco v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

A lay person is competent to report on the onset and reoccurrence of current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).? The Board must determine, on a?case-by-case?basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428, 438 (2011); see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021); Ortiz?v.?Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

 

The claimant bears the burden of presenting and supporting a claim for benefits.  38?U.S.C. §?5107(a).  See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Left Knee Disabilities

Rating Criteria

The Veteran is currently in receipt of a 10 percent disability rating for left knee strain with arthritis under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5010-5260, based on painful motion and x-ray evidence of traumatic arthritis; an initial 10 percent rating for left knee strain with patellar instability under DC 5257, based on recurrent instability without history of surgical repair and that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker; and an initial 10 percent rating for left knee strain with semilunar cartilage under DC 5259, based on symptomatic semilunar cartilage.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5010, 5257, 5259, 5260; January 2020, March 2022, and May 2022 Rating Decisions.  The Veteran seeks higher ratings.  See March 2022 Correspondence.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion (ROM) testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").

The Board observes that the schedular criteria for evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, including the knee joint, have undergone revision.  Specifically, revisions to DCs 5003, 5010, and 5257 were made effective February 7, 2021.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76460, 76457 (Feb 7, 2021).  Given that the claim period in this case commenced on February 8, 2022, the amended rating criteria are for application.

Under both the earlier and revised rating criteria, degenerative arthritis is rated under DC 5003.  Under this code, arthritis established by X-ray findings is rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate DCs for the specific joint or joints involved.  When, however, the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is noncompensable under the appropriate DCs, a rating of 10 percent is for application for each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion, to be combined and not added, under DC 5003.  For purpose of rating disability from arthritis, the knee is considered a major joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45(f).  The DCs that focus on limitation of motion of the knee are DC 5260 (limitation of flexion) and 5261 (limitation of extension).  The rating criteria under DCs 5260 and 5261 were not changed under the 2021 amendment.

For rating purposes, normal range of motion in a knee joint is from 0 to 140 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

VA's General Counsel has held that separate ratings are available for limitation of flexion and limitation of extension under DCs 5260 and 5261.  VAOPGCPREC 9-2004 (2004).

Effective February 7, 2021, DC 5257 provides ratings for both recurrent subluxation or instability of the knee and for patellar instability.

As it pertains to recurrent subluxation or instability of the knee, DC 5257 provides a 10 percent rating for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for either (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device, or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device or bracing for ambulation.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation.

As it pertains to patellar instability of the knee, DC 5257 provides a 10 percent rating for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: A brace, cane, or walker.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker.

Note (1): For patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.

Note (2): A surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).  See DC 5257 (Effective February 7, 2021).

The Board notes that DC 5257 does not require objective medical evidence of instability for a rating to be assigned.  See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347 (2018).

Separate ratings may be assigned for limitation of flexion, extension, instability, and a meniscal disability of the same knee under DCs 5260, 5261, 5258 or 5259.  Walleman v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 294 (2022); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017); VAOPGCPREC 09-04 (September 17, 2004).

DC 5258 provides a 20 percent rating may be assigned for dislocated semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint.  DC 5259 provides for a 10 percent rating for symptomatic removal of the semilunar cartilage.

DC 5260 provides for the evaluation of limitation of flexion of the knee.  A non-compensable (zero) rating is warranted when leg flexion is limited to 60 degrees.  A 10 percent rating is warranted when it is limited to 45 degrees, a 20 percent rating is warranted when it is limited to 30 degrees, and a 30 percent rating is warranted where flexion is limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under DC 5261, extension limited to 5 degrees warrants a 0 percent rating, extension limited to 10 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating, extension limited to 15 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating, extension limited to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating, extension limited to 30 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating, and extension limited to 45 degrees warrants a 50 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

The Board notes that the rating criteria under DCs 5258, 5259, 5260 and 5261 were not changed under the 2021 amendment.

VA's General Counsel has held that a claimant who has arthritis and instability of the knee may be rated separately under DCs 5003 and 5257.  VAOPGCPREC 23-97; 62 Fed. Reg. 63,604 (1997).  The General Counsel subsequently clarified that for a knee disability rated under DC 5257 to warrant a separate rating for arthritis based on X-ray findings and limitation of motion, limitation of motion under DC 5260 or DC 5261 need not be compensable but must at least meet the criteria for a zero-percent rating.

A separate rating for arthritis can also be based on X-ray findings and painful motion under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  VAOPGCPREC 9-98 (1998); 63 Fed. Reg. 56,704 (1998).  VA's General Counsel has subsequently held that separate ratings can also be provided for limitation of knee extension and flexion.  VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59,990 (2004).

Ratings Analyses

Turning to the evidence, at the outset, the Board notes that the record on appeal includes few treatment records regarding the Veteran's service-connected left knee disabilities.

For the reasons set forth below, the Board finds that increased ratings for the Veteran's service-connected left knee disabilities are not supported by the record on appeal.

VA treatment records reflect that during a May 2022 VA mental health outpatient appointment, the Veteran denied any significant pain symptoms and endorsed no pain-related or weakness issues.  See May 2022 VA Mental Health Outpatient Notes; May 2022 VA Psychiatry Nursing Note.

In March 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  The examiner confirmed the diagnosis of left knee strain with arthritis and diagnosed left patellar instability and a left meniscus condition.  The examiner noted that the diagnosis of left patellar instability is "directly due to or related to" left knee strain with arthritis, explaining that a 2004 MRI finding of left tricompartmental focal chondral loss consistent with degenerative joint disease indicated cartilage loss of the left knee joint that, according to medical literature, can lead to swelling, instability, and buckling of the knee, which was present on examination.

The Veteran reported left knee pain and swelling, emphasizing that pain increased with weight-bearing, flexion and extension: "I can't walk uphill or walk long distances.  My dog is a puller and can pull me down.  I can't keep up with my nine year old.  I can't use the knee to go upstairs [because] it doesn't support my weight.  I can't do the dishes because of pain standing.  I need to change positions every 20 minutes."  He added that his left knee "locks up" and he frequently has effusion, "the whole thing swells.  It swells by 9 at night probably due to more activity."

The Veteran reported that he used rest, heat and Naproxen to treat his left knee symptoms.  He endorsed occasional use of a knee compression sleeve/brace, but the examiner noted that the Veteran's use of an assistive device was not prescribed by a physician.  The Veteran endorsed left knee flare ups every two days caused by increased activity that lasted 30-40 minutes with pain at 8 on a scale of 10.  He described the flare ups as his left knee feeling "hot, it heats up at meniscal line. The pains are sharp and intermittent. I can feel my heartbeat in my knee."  He denied having surgery on his left knee.

During active and passive range of motion (ROM) testing, the Veteran had left knee flexion to 80 degrees, extension to 0 degrees.  There was no objective evidence of pain on weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing.  There was objective evidence of crepitus and localized tenderness on palpation of the left knee joint.  There was additional loss of function after repetitive testing, with left knee flexion to 75 degrees and extension to 0 degrees.  The examiner noted that the Veteran was not examined immediately after repetitive use over time, but that in considering procured evidence, functional ability during repetitive use would be impacted by pain, estimating left knee flexion to 70 degrees, extension to 0 degrees.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran was not examined during a flare up, but that in considering procured evidence, functional ability during a flare up would be impacted by pain, estimating left knee flexion to 65 degrees, extension to 0 degrees.

The Veteran was negative for muscle atrophy on the left side as well as ankylosis.  The examiner performed joint stability testing and was found to be positive for recurrent patellar instability.  He was negative for recurrent patellar dislocation, 

shin splints, stress fractures, and other tibial or fibular impairment.  He was negative for chronic exertional compartment syndrome.  He was positive for a left knee meniscus (semilunar cartilage) condition, with frequent episodes of locking, joint pain, and joint effusion, but no history of dislocated cartilage or surgical treatment.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's left knee disabilities impact his ability to perform occupational tasks in that he lost two to four weeks of work time over the previous 12 months and his left knee symptoms limit running, kneeling, crawling, squatting, prolonged standing, prolonged walking, and high impact activities.  See March 2022 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

In March 2023, the AOJ requested a VA medical opinion clarifying whether the left knee meniscal disability diagnosed by the March 2022 VA examiner is a progression of the earlier diagnosed and service-connected left knee strain with arthritis.  In May 2023, a VA examiner opined that the left knee meniscal disability is a progression of his service-connected left knee strain, explaining that "[i]t is known, and medical literature supports the fact, that [a] knee injury can accelerate structural (cartilage or joint) changes to the knee.  The Veterans left knee strain has progressed with evidence of chondral loss and [degenerative joint disease]."  The examiner added, "Knee injuries are a strong risk factor for knee osteoarthritis and may distinguish knees with accelerated knee osteoarthritis from common knee osteoarthritis progression or knees with no knee osteoarthritis."

In March 2022, the Veteran's attorney asserted that the March 2022 VA examination supports a disability rating of at least 20 percent under DC 5260 because the Veteran reported during the examination that his left knee pain is worse with weight-bearing and activity, flare ups of pain that occurred about every two days, requiring him to stop all activity until the pain decreased, and additional loss of motion after three repetitions.  See March 2022 Evidence/Argument.

On review of the evidence, both lay and medical, the Board finds that a disability rating higher than the presently assigned 10 percent for left knee strain with arthritis, and initial disability ratings higher than the presently assigned 10 percent for left knee strain with patellar instability and left knee strain with semilunar cartilage are not warranted.  The March 2022 VA examination reflects left knee extension at 0 degrees, and flexion, at worst to 65 degrees during flare ups, recurrent patellar instability without surgical repair or that required prescribed use of a brace, cane, or walker by a medical provider, and symptomatic semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of locking, joint pain, and joint effusion, but without evidence of dislocation.  Although the Veteran endorsed use of a knee brace, the use was occasional and not prescribed by a medical provider.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms for this period more nearly approximate the criteria for a 10 percent rating for arthritis under DC 5010-5260, an initial 10 percent rating for left knee patellar instability under DC 5257, and an initial 10 percent rating for left knee semilunar cartilage under DC 5259.  Ratings higher than 10 percent are not warranted during this period given the absence of evidence of limitation of flexion to 30 degrees or less, the absence of evidence of surgical repair for patellar instability or prescription of a brace, cane, or walker by a medical provider, and the absence of evidence of dislocated semilunar cartilage.   38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257, 5259, 5260; see Fagan, supra.

Regarding the attorney's March 2022 argument that higher ratings are warranted based on the Veteran's endorsement of left knee pain worse with weight-bearing and activity, flare ups of pain that occurred about every two days, requiring him to stop all activity until the pain decreased, and additional loss of motion after three repetitions, the March 2022 VA examiner noted these symptoms.  The VA examiner specifically noted the Veteran's reports of pain and mobility problems the Veteran associates with his service-connected left knee disabilities.  However, the VA examiner observed that there was no pain on weightbearing, and ROM, considering the Veteran's subjective reports and objective examination findings, was, at worst, estimated at flexion to 65 degrees during flare ups, and extension was normal at 0 degrees.  Therefore, the Veteran's left knee symptoms are contemplated by the presently assigned respective 10 percent ratings.

The Board recognizes that unless the plain language of rating criteria specifically contemplates the effects of medication, the Board may not consider relief from symptoms afforded by medication.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); see also Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 at *18-19 (March 12, 2025) (VA cannot assess a veteran's worst-case scenario if factoring in the beneficial effects of medication).  Here, while the March 2022 VA knee examination notes that the Veteran was taking Naproxen for left knee symptoms, VA treatment records for the period on appeal, which include reconciliations of the Veteran's prescribed and non-prescribed medications, do not reflect prescription or use of Naproxen or other medication for symptoms associated with the Veteran's left knee arthritis, patellar instability, or semilunar cartilage.  See Fagan, supra.  Therefore, the notation in the March 2022 examination DBQ appears to be in error, and the record on appeal is reflective of the Veteran's left knee symptomatology without the ameliorative effects of medication.

The Board acknowledges the March 2022 arguments of the Veteran's attorney, asserting entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent under DC 5260 for left knee strain with arthritis due to pain that is worsened by weight and activity, and flare ups every two days that further reduce left knee ROM and requires the Veteran to stop all activity until the pain decreases.  However, on examination, the March 2022 VA examiner observed that there was no objective evidence of pain with weight-bearing and non-weight.  Furthermore, during repetitive use testing, flexion was to 75 degrees, and the examiner estimated a reduction in flexion to 65 degrees with flare ups.  Thus, even considering reduced ROM with repetitive use and during flare ups, the rating criteria contemplates functional impairment due to limited motion of the knee, including limitation caused by pain.  Therefore, the criteria for a rating higher than 10 percent for left knee strain with arthritis is not approximated.

To the extent that the Veteran asserts entitlement to a higher rating based on ankylosis of the left knee, the Veteran's treatment records are silent as to ankylosis or symptoms analogous to ankylosis, and the March 2022 VA examiner specifically found that the Veteran does not have ankylosis.  See March 2022 VA Knee and Lower Leg Conditions DBQ at 14 (Section V); see Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1, 11 (2021) (the criteria for a rating based on ankylosis may be met by evidence demonstrating the functional equivalent of ankylosis, ie., functional loss consistent with that contemplated by ankylosis).  Although the Veteran is competent to report the circumstances giving rise to observable symptoms, as well as the nature of the symptoms, he has not been shown to be competent to diagnose complex medical problems, such as knee disorders, or to opine as to their etiology, which are medical questions.  See Kahana, 24 Vet. App. at 438.

Accordingly, entitlement to ratings in excess of 10 percent for left knee strain with arthritis, left knee strain with patellar instability, and left knee strain with semilunar cartilage must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.71a, DC 5257.

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?366, 69-70 (2017).
