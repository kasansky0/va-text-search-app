ORDER

Entitlement to a certificate for financial assistance in acquiring specially adapted housing (SAH) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a permanent and total disability rating.

The Veteran does not require regular and constant use of a wheelchair, braces, crutches, or canes as a normal mode of locomotion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a certificate of eligibility for financial assistance in acquiring specially adapted housing have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 2101(a), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.809. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1981 to November 2001.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in February 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Specially Adapted Housing

A specially adaptive housing award is money received from VA to assist an eligible veteran in buying, building, or changing their permanent home.

To be eligible for SAH, a veteran must meet all the eligibility requirements of having both a permanent and total service-connected disability that is due to one of the scenarios listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.809, as detailed further below.

The disability must first be considered "totally" disabling. This includes a 100 percent rating (which includes awards under 38 U.S.C. § 1151) or an award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on a single disability. However, a TDIU may still be considered as a qualifying total rating when granted based on multiple disabilities, for SAH purposes, when those multiple disabilities have the same etiology that affect mobility. Kilpatrick v. Principi, 327 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2003); 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. 

Specially adapted housing is available to a veteran who is entitled to compensation for permanent and total disability due to: (1) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) rated as 100 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8017; (2) blindness in both eyes, having only light perception, plus the anatomical loss or loss of use of one lower extremity; (3) full thickness or subdermal burns that have resulted in contractures with limitation of motion of two or more extremities or of at least one extremity and the trunk; or (4) the loss or loss of use of both upper extremities such as to preclude use of the arms at or above the elbows.

Specially adapted housing is also available to a veteran with a permanent and total disability that precludes locomotion without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair due to: (5) the loss, or loss of use, of both lower extremities; (6) the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity, together with residuals of organic disease or injury which affect the functions of balance and propulsion; or, (7) the loss or loss of use of one lower extremity together with the loss or loss of use of one upper extremity which affect the functions of balance or propulsion. 38 U.S.C. § 2101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(a), (b), (d).

The term "preclude locomotion" is defined as the necessity for regular and constant use of a wheelchair, braces, crutches, or canes as a normal mode of locomotion although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.809(d). "[L]oss of use" exists when there is "deprivation of the ability to avail oneself" of that extremity, and functional impairment caused by pain, weakness, or incoordination should be taken into account when making that determination. See Jensen v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 66, 78-79 (2017). The terms "locomotion" and "ambulate" are defined as the ability to move about or walk.

There is an exception to the totally disabling service-connected disability requirement for certain disabilities relevant only to veterans who served after September 11, 2001. The veteran must have a permanent disability that was incurred during such service, and which results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  See 38 U.S.C. § 2101 (a)(2)(C).  Under this exception, the service?connected disability does not require a total rating. 

Factual Background

The Veteran contends she is entitled to a certificate for financial assistance in acquiring specially adapted housing due to her service-connected fibromyalgia. See September 2023 Claim. The Veteran contends she needs a "walk-in" bath tube due to her service-connected disability.  Id. Specifically, she stated she was unable to get in and out of her bath tub due to her fibromyalgia and pain. See May 2024 Notice of Disagreement. 

During the period of review, the Veteran had been granted service-connection for the following disabilities: Fibromyalgia with a 40 percent rating from October 23, 2019; Left Foot Hallux Valgus with a 10 percent rating from February 25, 2004; L5-S1 Disc Bulge with a noncompensable rating from February 25, 2004; C3-C4 Disc Bulge with a noncompensable rating from February 25, 2004; Right Foot Hallux Vagus with a noncompensable rating from February 25, 2004; Bilateral Hearing Loss with a noncompensable rating from February 25, 2004; Scar Residual, Laparotomy with a noncompensable rating from February 25, 2005; Left Foot Scar with a noncompensable rating from October 23, 2019.

Even though none of the Veteran's disabilities result in a total disability or unemployability, one exception could apply to this case.  SAH may be available to a veteran who served on or after September 11, 2001, who has a permanent disability that was incurred during such service, and which results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  See 38 U.S.C. § 2101 (a)(2)(C).  Under this exception, the service?connected disability does not require a total disability rating.

The Veteran served on or after September 11, 2001, and was granted service connection for her fibromyalgia, a permanent disability which was incurred during her service.  

The key inquiry is whether the Veteran's permanent disability results in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  

A November 2019 VA Podiatry Examination reports the Veteran did not use assistive devices as a normal mode of locomotion. Veteran reported that, "any prolong walking, standing, carrying weight or going up and down stairs at school causes extreme pain." She stated she always has to find a reason to sit and teach instead of standing. The Veteran also reported that during flare-ups she was unable to stand, walk, or bear weight for long periods of time. 

A September 26, 2022 podiatry outpatient note reports the Veteran experienced right foot pain that may have been aggravated by her fibromyalgia. The clinician noted that the Veteran wore orthotic inserts, but she did not want custom dress orthotics at that time. See October 2023 VA Treatment Record.

An April 13, 2023 VA treatment note reports the Veteran denied weakness in extremities or gait disturbance.  Id. 

A July 10, 2023 progress note reports the Veteran's gait was "normal, smooth and steady non-antalgic native gait." Id. 

An October 2023 Service Treatment Record reports the Veteran was prescribed a walk-in tub due to limited mobility caused by her rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.  

Analysis

The medical evidence of record does not report that Veteran's permanent disability resulted in loss or loss of use of one or more extremities which so affects the functions of balance or propulsion as to preclude ambulating without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  

The medical evidence of record does show that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities limit her ability to stand, walk, or weight bear for long periods of time. See November 2019 VA Examination.  The Board acknowledges that Veteran's extreme pain caused by her service-connected fibromyalgia, however, there is no medical evidence that reports the Veteran's disability precluded locomotion or the ability to ambulate without the aid of braces, crutches, canes, or a wheelchair.  Without evidence that the Veteran requires regular and constant use of a wheelchair, braces, crutches, or canes as a normal mode of locomotion, the appeal must be denied. 

For the reasons set forth above, the Board finds that the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so regarding entitlement to a certificate of eligibility for financial assistance in acquiring specially adapted housing. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran. Thus, the benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), cannot be applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application). As the evidence is persuasively against the claim, it must be denied.
