DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease (CAD) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) on the basis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for liver cancer is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran had an informal or formal claim for service connection for CAD prior to September 11, 2023.

2. The competent and probative evidence is persuasively against finding that GERD has been manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress or recurrent or refractory epigastric strictures.

3. There is an approximate balance of competent and probative evidence as to whether service-connected PTSD has prevented the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment.

4. The Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for service connection for CAD are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.2500

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for GERD are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability on the basis of posttraumatic stress disorder alone are met.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

4. The criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352, 4.25.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1969 to August 1971.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision and an October 2024 Higher-Level Review decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2024 rating decision.  In October 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the October HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision.

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his or her representative with the VA Form 10182 or within 90 days of receipt of the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

This case has been advanced on the docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

Earlier Effective Date

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease

The Veteran seeks an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the grant of service connection for coronary artery disease.

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an initial claim, or a supplemental claim, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  

Under the AMA, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim following notice of a decision by the AOJ or the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  An effective date will be preserved if a veteran files for administrative review within one year of any decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  However, while the date of claim is preserved when a claim is continuously pursued, the proper effective date is still subject to a finding regarding when entitlement to the benefit sought arose.

Prior to March 2015, any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if the formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the claimant, it will be considered filed as of the date of the receipt of the informal claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2014).

As of March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims.  In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Here, the Veteran submitted a formal application for service connection for a heart condition on September 11, 2023.  There is no evidence of record that shows that the Veteran submitted an informal or formal claim for service connection for CAD prior to September 11, 2023.  Thus, the Board finds that an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for service connection for CAD is not warranted.

The Board finds that the effective date provisions with regard to liberalizing laws under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114, and the special effective date provisions applicable to Nehmer class members, do not afford a basis for an earlier effective date in this case, for the reasons that follow.

Effective August 31, 2010, ischemic heart disease (among other diseases) was added to the list of diseases presumed to be caused by exposure to an herbicide agent such as Agent Orange under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  See 75 Fed. Reg. 53, 202 (August 31, 2010).  That addition constitutes a liberalizing law.  The effective date of a claim granted pursuant to a liberalizing law or administrative issue can be no earlier than the effective date of the law or administrative issue.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.816, and as required by the United States District Court in the class-action case of Nehmer v. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, No. CV-86-6160 (N.D. Cal. May 17, 1991), Nehmer class members may benefit from special effective date rules.  To qualify as a Nehmer class member, the claimant must be a Vietnam veteran with a covered herbicide disease, or a surviving spouse, child, or parent of a deceased Vietnam veteran who died from a covered herbicide disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(b)(1).  A "covered herbicide disease" means a disease for which VA has established a presumption of service connection pursuant to the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102-4, other than chloracne, as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  

The provisions of § 3.816 provide, in pertinent part, that when a compensation claim for a covered herbicide disease is denied in a decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, or is pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or received by VA between that date and the effective date of the statute or regulation establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered disease, the effective date of the award of service connection is the later of the date the claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose.  § 3.816(c).  If such a claim is submitted within one year of service separation, then the effective date of the award is the day following the date of separation from service.  § 3.816(c)(3).  In other words, notwithstanding the fact that there was a prior final denial of the claim, or that the claim was submitted prior to the effective date of the newly established presumption for a covered herbicide disease, the effective date of service connection may be as early as the date of the original claim, as opposed to the date of the petition to reopen or the effective date of the new law.  The evidence of record fails to show that the Veteran had an earlier informal or formal claim for service connection for coronary artery disease.  Therefore, as service connection for CAD was not denied in a rating decision issued between September 25, 1985 and May 3, 1989, as a claim for service connection for CAD was not pending on May 3, 1989, and as a claim was not received by the VA between May 3, 1989 and August 31, 2010, the Veteran is not entitled to an earlier effective date under this provision. 

Furthermore, with respect to 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3), as the Veteran's claim for service connection for ischemic heart disease was reviewed at his request more than 1 year after the effective date of the liberalizing law adding such disease to the list of those acknowledged to be presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents, benefits may be authorized for a period of 1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request; however, the evidence must show that he met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law and that such eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of the claim or administrative determination of entitlement. Such is not the case here. Specifically, the effective date of the relevant liberalizing law is August 31, 2010, and the evidence of record (as described in detail above) reflects the Veteran was not diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, specifically atherosclerotic heart disease, until November 2022.  In the absence of a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, the Veteran did not meet all the eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit from August 31, 2010, the effective date of the liberalizing law and, accordingly, an earlier effective date under this provision is not warranted.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for service connection for CAD is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.2500.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings.  See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the entire record to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3

1. Entitlement to an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

The Veteran seeks a higher initial evaluation for GERD.

The Veteran's GERD has been evaluated as 10 percent disabling under 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7399-7346.  Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  GERD is not specifically listed in the Schedule, and the hyphenated diagnostic code including the "99" series indicates that the most analogous diagnostic code for the Veteran's GERD is Diagnostic Code 7346, which applies to hiatal hernia due to the similarity of the symptom presentation for hiatal hernia and GERD.  38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

Under Diagnostic Code 7346, a 60 percent rating is warranted where there are symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia, or other symptoms combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  A 30 percent rating is warranted where there is persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  a 10 percent rating is warranted where there are two or more of the symptoms listed in the criteria for the 30 percent rating of less severity.

Neither "considerable" nor "severe" are defined in the Rating Schedule.  However, the term "considerable" is defined by the dictionary as "large in extent or degree," and "severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful."  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267, 1140 (11th ed. 2012).  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be equitable and just.  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue. Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for a higher disability rating.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

The Board notes that the criteria for rating disabilities of the digestive system were amended, effective May 19, 2024.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities; The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19,735 (March 20, 2024).  Effective May 19, 2024, Diagnostic Code 7206 became effective specifically for GERD.  Under Diagnostic Code 7206 as amended, a noncompensable evaluation is assigned for documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement.  A 50 percent rating is assigned for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year.  A maximum 80 percent rating is assigned for documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of the symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).

For purposes of evaluating conditions in 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, the term "substantial weight loss" means a loss of greater than 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer; and the term "minor weight loss" means a weight loss of 10 to 20 percent of the individual's baseline weight, sustained for three months or longer.  38 C.F.R. § 4.112.  The term "inability to gain weight" means that there has been substantial weight loss with an inability to regain it despite appropriate therapy.  "Baseline weight" means the average weight for the two years preceding the onset of the disease.

In January 2024, the Veteran underwent a VA examination, where he described his symptoms as burping, indigestion, and nausea 2 to 3 times a week.  He reported taking Famotidine 40mg daily and over-the-counter Tums and Pepto Bismol.  The signs and symptoms due to GERD included pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and 4 or more occurrences of nausea and sleep disturbances per year lasting less than 1 day. He did not have an esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus, or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus.  The examiner opined that GERD impacts the Veteran's ability to work in that sleep disturbances at night leads to feeling fatigued throughout the day.

After careful review of the evidence, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against finding that GERD has been manifested by persistently recurrent epigastric distress or recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) during the period on appeal.  As such, the evidence is persuasively against a higher, 30 percent evaluation under either rating criteria.  The competent and probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's GERD has resulted in pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, nausea, and sleep disturbances.  There is no medical or lay evidence of more severe symptoms of persistently recurrent epigastric distress or recurrent or refractory esophageal strictures.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and the claim for an initial evaluation greater than 10 percent is denied.  See 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

2. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability

The Veteran seeks a TDIU.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  Id. 

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App.?58, 73 (2019), the Court defined the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" as having two components: one economic and one noneconomic.  The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person.  The Court defined "employment in a protected environment" within 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).  The non-economic component includes consideration of the following: the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.

From September 11, 2023, the period on appeal, the Veteran's combined disability rating is 100 percent based on the combined evaluation of multiple disabilities.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) has recognized that a 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a Veteran is totally disabled. Holland v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 443, 446 (1994), citing Swan v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 20, 22 (1990).  Thus, when VA finds a veteran to be totally disabled as a result of a particular service-connected disability or a combination of disabilities, there is no need, and no authority, to otherwise rate that veteran totally disabled on any other basis.  See Herlehy v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 33, 35 (2001) (finding a request for TDIU moot where 100 percent schedular rating was awarded for the same period).

The Board recognizes, however, that in some cases, assignment of a 100 percent schedular rating may not render a TDIU claim moot.  Indeed, special monthly compensation (SMC) may be warranted in addition to regular compensation if a veteran has a total disability rating for a single disability, and additional service-connected disability or disabilities rated at 60 percent or more.  The total rating for the single disability for SMC purposes may be schedular, or may be based on TDIU, so long as TDIU was granted solely because of that single disability.

Here, the Veteran does not otherwise have one service-connected disability rated at 100 percent.  After careful review of the evidence, the Board finds that a TDIU on the basis of PTSD alone is warranted.

In a May 2024 medical opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's service connected disability causes the Veteran to have difficulty maintaining concentration and focus on work over a period of time, to have intrusive thoughts which interfere with the Veteran's ability to stay focused on the task at hand and cause him to be fatigued at work due to disrupted sleep making concentration and focus on work assignments difficult.  The examiner further opined that the Veteran would be able to maintain part-time work with accommodations based upon his mental health symptoms alone.  The Veteran's mental health symptoms include depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances.  November 4, 2019, VA Examination. 

The Board notes that in a November 2023 decision, the Board highlighted the Veteran's September 2023 Board hearing testimony that "if a rating of 70 percent was assigned for the Veteran's service-connected [posttraumatic stress disorder], he did not wish to pursue a claim of entitlement to a TDIU" and the Board did not address the issue of entitlement to a TDIU as part of the appeal for an increased rating for PTSD.  The Veteran did not appeal the November 2023 determination.  He filed a VA 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability in December 2023.   

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that there is an approximate balance of evidence as to whether PTSD has prevented the Veteran from securing or following substantially gainful employment.  In making this finding, the Board finds the May 2024 medical opinion to be most probative.  As the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Board find that the benefit-of-the-doubt is applicable.  Affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, a TDIU on the basis of PTSD alone is granted.

3. Entitlement to special monthly compensation at the housebound rate

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), special monthly compensation may be granted if the veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound.  For the purpose of this subsection, the requirement of "permanently housebound" will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to such veteran's house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such veteran's lifetime.  Id.  In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) the Court held that a separate award of TDIU predicated on a single disability may form the basis for an award of special monthly compensation based on housebound status.

In this case, the Board notes that as a result of this decision, a TDIU due to service-connected PTSD has been granted.  Thus, for SMC purposes, PTSD satisfies the requirement of a "service-connected disability rated as total."  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251 (2011).  The Veteran's additional service-connected disabilities are independently rated as follows: coronary artery disease (rated 60 percent from September 11, 2023); sleep apnea (rated 50 percent from August 30, 2019); diabetes mellitus type II (rated 20 percent from April 17, 2019); left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (rated 10 percent from April 17, 2019); right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy (rated 10 percent from April 17, 2019); GERD (rated 10 percent from September 11, 2023); and hypertension (rated 0 percent from September 11, 2022).  

Accordingly, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C.A. § 1114(s) is granted.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Service connection for liver cancer is remanded.

The Board is not able to make a fully informed decision regarding the issue of service connection for liver cancer.

The Veteran contends that liver cancer is due to weight gain associated with service connected diabetes mellitus and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  September 11, 2023, VA 21-526EZ.

The Veteran underwent a VA Examination in January 2024.  The examiner diagnosed liver cancer status post resection with an October 2022 date of diagnosis.  The examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion and cited a study that concluded that "[t]here was no significant association between exposure to Agent Orange and hepatocellular cancer, although larger studies are needed in the U.S. military veteran population to evaluate further this toxic herbicide from the Vietnam War era." 

The Board finds that the January 2024 medical opinion is inadequate as the examiner does not address a theory of entitlement raised by the Veteran.  See Robinson v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008), aff'd sub nom. Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (Board is required to consider theories of entitlement to benefits that are either raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record).  The Veteran is asserting that obesity (weight gain) is an intermediate step between service connected diabetes mellitus and PTSD and non-service connected liver cancer.  Accordingly, remand for a new opinion is required.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of liver cancer.  The need for an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner.  The examiner should review the claims file and address the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal probability) that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities caused or aggravated (i.e., worsened beyond the normal progression) the Veteran's obesity. 

(b.) If so, whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal probability) that the Veteran's obesity was a substantial factor in causing or aggravating non-service-connected liver cancer.

(c.) Whether it is at least as likely as not (an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, i.e., nearly equal probability) that non-service-connected liver would not have occurred but for obesity caused by service-connected disabilities.

Secondary service connection is warranted where a nonservice-connected disability would have been less severe "but-for" a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

A thorough rationale, to include reference to relevant evidence of record as appropriate, should be provided for all opinions expressed.  If the examiner is unable to provide a requested opinion, a supporting rationale must be given concerning why the opinion cannot be provided.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
