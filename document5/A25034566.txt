DOCKET NO. 211026-320468
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's treatment by a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on April 13, 2021, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

While the appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the Appellant's claims for payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's treatment that was provided on April 13, 2021.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding non-VA treatment on April 13, 2021, are met. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1969 to April 1971. This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2021 decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The Appellant is a non-VA provider.

The Appellant filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in October 2021 and requested a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge. However, while this appeal was pending, the Appellant submitted a new claim for this episode of care, and it was processed and paid in November and December 2021. In December 2022, VA sent two letters to the Appellant confirming that payment was made and specifying the relevant payment dates and amounts paid.

The administrative action approving payment for the treatment in question constitutes a complete grant of the benefits sought. As a result, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d); 38?C.F.R. §?20.801(b).
