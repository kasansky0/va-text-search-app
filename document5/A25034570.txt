ORDER

Service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is denied.

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Service connection for hearing loss is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence available for review does not reflect that the Veteran had a diagnosis of TBI, or residuals thereof, at any time during the pendency or proximate to the filing of his claim.

2. The weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to the requirements of the Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) at any time during the pendency or proximate to the filing of his claim; all of his psychiatric symptomatology has been attributed to his already service-connected generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder, recurrent, without psychotic features, and specified trauma and other stressor related disorder.

3. The weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against a finding the Veteran's current hearing loss disability was incurred in or is otherwise the result of his active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an award of service connection for TBI have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for an award of service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 4.125.

3. The criteria for an award of service connection for hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2006 to October 2007, to include service in Iraq.  His decorations include the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

The rating decision immediately underlying the present appeal was issued in September 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  Following a denial on Higher-Level Review in October 2022, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board of Veteran's Appeals (Board) by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in September 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the September 2021 AOJ rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

In this regard, the Board sent a letter to the Veteran in October 2023 explaining the steps he needed to take if he wanted to have additional evidence considered in conjunction with this appeal.  See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  As he has not responded to that letter, the Board will proceed to consider his appeal on the basis of direct review.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claims.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that service connection was previously denied for TBI, PTSD, and hearing loss, most recently in September 2020.  In the October 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the AOJ appears to have made an implicit favorable finding that new and relevant evidence has been presented or secured to warrant readjudication of the previously denied claims, inasmuch as it denied the claims on the merits.  The Board is bound by that implicit favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Board also notes that the scope of a claim for service connection for a mental health disability ordinarily includes any psychiatric disorders that may reasonably be encompassed by the Veteran's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  In this case, however, service connection has already been established for acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, currently recognized as generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder, recurrent, without psychotic features, and specified trauma and other stressor related disorder.  The specific issue advanced in the current appeal is whether service connection is warranted for PTSD.  As such, the Board will limit its consideration to that diagnosis.

In an October 2023 letter, the Board notified the Veteran that his appeal had been placed on the Board's docket and that he had 90 days from the date of receipt of his VA Form 10182 to request a change in representative, if he wished to do so.  Thereafter, in November 2023-within the 90-day window-he appointed a private attorney to represent him.  Subsequently, in January 2025, he submitted another VA Form 21-22a (Appointment of Individual as Claimant's Representative) in favor of a different private attorney.  Inasmuch as the new appointment was received more than 90 days after receipt of the VA Form 10182, and no good cause for the late filing has been shown, the new representative will not be recognized for purposes of the present appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1304(b).

Service Connection

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  See, e.g., Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant is shown to have the disability either at the time he or she files his or her claim for service connection, or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to final adjudication.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  When the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that must be addressed in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).  The term "disability" as used for VA purposes generally contemplates functional impairment resulting in loss of earning capacity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

If a Veteran serves 90 days or more of active, continuous service after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases-including organic diseases of the nervous system-to a degree of 10 percent or more during the one-year period following his separation from that service, service connection for the condition may be established on a presumptive basis, notwithstanding that there is no in-service record of the disorder.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  

Service connection may also be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by (a) evidence of (i) a chronic disease shown as such in service (or within an applicable presumptive period under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(i) and (ii) subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease, or (b) if the fact of chronicity in service in not adequately supported, by evidence of continuity of symptomatology.  However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) relating to continuity of symptomatology can be applied only in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In an October 1995 opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system, and therefore a presumptive disability.

In adjudicating the Veteran's claims, the Board observes that nothing of record shows that he has the requisite knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to render medical opinions.  Consequently, his contentions cannot constitute competent medical evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).

However, in making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and recurrence of observable symptoms.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent, the Board must determine, on a case by case basis, whether the veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  An approximate balance of the evidence includes, but is not limited to, equipoise.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Evidence is not in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal" when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for TBI

In a July 2021 affidavit, the Veteran stated that he did not remember exactly how he sustained a TBI.  However, he believed that it was related to his service in Iraq, when he was underground looking for Saddam.  He reported that there was no air underground, that there was no telling what that caused, and that he knew he had not been the same since.

The Board notes that TBI is a complex condition, and that specialized medical knowledge is needed to diagnose the condition and identify its residuals.  That is particularly true where, as here, the Veteran himself acknowledges that he does not recall the specific mechanism whereby he sustained a TBI.

The Veteran's service treatment records show that he was treated on various occasions for complaints of headaches and cognitive and memory problems, and that he underwent a CT (computed tomography) scan and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of his head in December 2006.  However, his complaints were not attributed to a TBI, and the test findings were normal.

The Board further notes that none of the post-service medical treatment records show a diagnosis of TBI, nor are there any findings of any residuals thereof.  No such disability was diagnosed on a June 2007 VA general medical examination.  Moreover, VA mental disorders examinations conducted in January 2019 and June 2019 included explicit findings to the effect that there was no evidence of a TBI in the records reviewed.  That is to say, there is competent medical evidence to the effect that he affirmatively did not have a TBI.

The Board also observes that the Veteran's memory and other problems have generally been associated with his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder.  He is also service-connected for headaches, associated with his service-connected cervical spine disability; as well as dyspnea/voice disturbance and a vocal cord condition.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Here, the available medical evidence does not reflect that the Veteran had a diagnosis of TBI, or residuals thereof, at any time during the pendency or proximate to the filing of his claim.  As the weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against the claim, the appeal of this issue must be denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for PTSD

Specific to claims for service connection for mental disorders, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that a diagnosis conforming to the DSM-5 is required.  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393 (2020); 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).  In addition, service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the AOJ has made a favorable finding that the presence of an in-service stressor can be conceded on the basis of fear of hostile military or terrorist activity during the Veteran's service in Iraq.  See October 2022 Higher-Level Review rating decision.  The Board is bound by that favorable finding, and it is not in dispute.

With regard to a diagnosis of PTSD, the Board notes that there are VA treatment reports of record, including in 2011, which contain findings of PTSD.  In that regard, the Board acknowledges that the Court has held that if a veteran has received a diagnosis of PTSD from a competent medical professional, VA must generally assume that the diagnosis was made in accordance with the appropriate psychiatric criteria in regard to the adequacy of the symptomatology and the sufficiency of the stressor.  Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 153 (1997).  However, VA may reject the claim on a finding that the weight of the evidence is against (1) the PTSD diagnosis, (2) the occurrence of the in-service stressor, or (3) the connection of the current condition to the in-service stressor.  The adequacy of a stressor, sufficiency of symptomatology, and diagnosis are all medical determinations.  Id. at 143-44.

In the present case, the evidence does not reflect that the foregoing notations of PTSD were made with consideration of the criteria in the DSM-5.  Indeed, the DSM-5 was not published until May 2013.  As such, any diagnoses rendered prior to that date would not have taken the DSM-5 criteria into account.

Moreover, although multiple VA treatment records dated in 2018 and 2019 identify DSM-5 diagnoses, they do not identify a diagnosis of PTSD.  Indeed, a PTSD screening in December 2019 was affirmatively noted to be negative.

More significantly, the Veteran was afforded multiple VA examinations for psychiatric disorders, and all of them diagnosed DSM-5 disorders other than PTSD.  For example, when asked to identify any mental disorders the Veteran had that conformed to the DSM-5, a January 2019 examiner listed generalized anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder in sustained remission.  Similarly, a June 2019 VA examination identified a DSM-5 diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.  

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against a finding the Veteran had a diagnosis of PTSD that conforms to the requirements of the DSM-5 at any time during the pendency or proximate to the filing of his claim.  On that basis, the issue on appeal must be denied.

The Board also notes, however, that all of the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology has already been attributed to his service-connected generalized anxiety disorder with major depressive disorder, recurrent, without psychotic features, and specified trauma and other stressor related disorder.  All psychiatric disorders, other than eating disorders, are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, and applicable law prohibits the evaluation of the same manifestations under different diagnoses.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14, 4.130.  As such, even if PTSD were found to be service connection, no additional compensation would be payable.

3. Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss

The Veteran also seeks to establish service connection for hearing loss.  He contended in a July 2021 affidavit that his hearing loss was the direct result of faulty ear plugs he was issued while in the military.

Specific to claims for service connection for hearing loss, impaired hearing is considered a "disability" for VA purposes only when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

As an initial matter, the Board finds that there is no evidence of a hearing loss disability for VA purposes until years after the Veteran's separation from active duty.  There was no evidence of a hearing loss disability in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 in the service treatment records.  Further, an August 2007 VA audiology examination revealed puretone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	10	10	10	15	15	13

LEFT	25	15	5	15	15	13

Speech recognition scores were 96 percent for the right ear, and 98 percent for the left ear. 

The Board acknowledges that more recent VA examinations in September 2019 and August 2021 do reflect the presence of a hearing loss disability of both ears.  However, as noted, those results were obtained many years after the Veteran's separation from service.

In light of the foregoing, it is patently clear that service connection for hearing loss is not warranted pursuant to the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 and 3.309(a).  Moreover, the Court has indicated that the absence of any medical records of diagnosis or treatment for many years after service can be probative evidence against a claim.  See Mense v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 354, 356 (1991) (affirming the Board where it found that the veteran failed to account for the lengthy time period after service for which there was no clinical documentation of a low back condition); see also Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (a prolonged period without medical complaint can be considered, along with other factors concerning a claimant's health and medical treatment during and after military service, as evidence of whether an injury or a disease was incurred in service which resulted in any chronic or persistent disability.).  Under circumstances such as this, where evidence of a hearing loss disability is lacking in service and for a period of years thereafter, medical opinion evidence is required to determine whether the currently shown disability is attributable to service.

Here, there are no medical opinions of record that relate the Veteran's current hearing loss disability to service, to include his account of faulty ear plugs.  Rather, the aforementioned September 2019 and August 2021 VA examination reports contain opinions against such a relationship.

In assessing the probative value to be assigned to a medical opinion, the Board must consider three factors.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).  The initial inquiry in determining probative value is to assess whether a medical expert was fully informed of the pertinent factual premises (i.e., the medical history) of the case.  A review of the claims file is not required since a medical professional can also become aware of the relevant medical history by having treated a Veteran for a long period of time or through a factually accurate medical history reported by a Veteran.  Id. at 303-04.  The second inquiry involves consideration of whether the medical expert provided a fully articulated opinion.  A medical opinion that is equivocal in nature or expressed in speculative language does not provide the degree of certainty required for medical nexus evidence.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  The third and final factor in determining the probative value of an opinion involves consideration of whether the opinion is supported by a reasoned analysis.  Most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning.  Therefore, a medical opinion containing only data and conclusions is not entitled to any weight.  In fact, a review of the claims file does not substitute for a lack of a reasoned analysis.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion . . . must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions.").  

Here, the examiners who conducted the aforementioned VA examinations were familiar with the Veteran's medical history from review of his claims folder, and accurately noted pertinent findings therein regarding his hearing loss.  Neither of their opinions were expressed in speculative or equivocal language, and they were both supported by a rationale.  In pertinent part, both examiners noted that the evidence indicated that the Veteran's hearing was within normal limits during service.  The September 2019 VA examiner noted that according to the American College of Occupational Medicine Noise and Hearing Conservation Committee "a noise induced hearing loss will not progress once it is stopped."  The August 2021 VA examiner also stated that hearing examination revealed a mixed loss, which was more consistent with veteran's history of middle ear disease with multiple sets of ventilation tubes as a child than with noise-induced hearing loss.

Inasmuch as the examiners' opinions were based on an accurate understanding of the facts, and articulated reasons for the conclusion reached, the Board finds the opinions probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra.  As noted, there are no medical opinions to the contrary.

In summary, the Veteran's hearing loss disability was first shown years after his separation from active duty, and the only medical opinions of record are against the claim.  In light of those facts, the Board must find that the weight of the evidence available for review is persuasively against a finding that his disability was ?

incurred in or is otherwise the result of active service.  The appeal of this issue is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
