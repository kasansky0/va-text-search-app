ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 28, 2022, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis is productive of pain and weakness with limitation of flexion to 110 degrees and abduction to 90 degrees, at worst, with consideration of repeated use over time and during flare-ups.

2. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, on December 28, 2022; it is not factually ascertainable that an increase in this disability occurred between December 28, 2021, and December 28, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than December 28, 2022, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.159, 3.400; DC 5010-5201.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from April 2011 to April 2015.

By way of history, the Veteran was service connected for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis in a July 2015 rating decision at an evaluation of 0 percent.  See July 2015 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not submit an appeal and submitted no new and material evidence within one year, so the decision became final.

In the May 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 28, 2022, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis

The Veteran contends that he was not awarded compensation (regarding his right shoulder) since 2015.  See May 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD).

Applicable Statutory and Regulatory Framework

The general rule governing the effective date of a rating increase provides that benefits are effective from the date that VA received the claim for an increase or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  But the effective date of a rating increase may date back 1 year before the date the claimant filed the claim for an increase, if "it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred" within that 1-year period.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 983 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (stating that to obtain an effective date earlier than the date of the claim for an increase, the increase in disability must have occurred during the 1-year period prior to the date of the claim); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007) ("When a claim for an increased rating is granted, the effective date assigned may be up to [1] year prior to the date that the application for increase was received if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred within that timeframe.").

Factual Background

The Veteran was service connected for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis in a July 2015 rating decision and assigned a noncompensable rating for his right should disability.  See July 2015 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not submit an appeal after this rating decision nor was new and material evidence submitted within a year of this rating decision.

Between the July 2015 rating decision and the Veteran's request for an increased rating in December 2022, the Veteran submitted no additional medical evidence regarding his service-connected right shoulder disability.

The Veteran submitted a request for an increased rating that was received by VA on December 28, 2022.  In March 2023, the AOJ granted an increased rating of 20 percent for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, effective December 28, 2022.  See March 2023 Rating Decision.  The effective date assigned was December 28, 2022, based on the date of receipt of the claim.  

Analysis

The appellant disagrees with the assigned effective date arguing that the effective date should be in "2015" or construed as April 18, 2015, the date of the Veteran's exit from active duty and grant of service connection.  See May 2023 NOD.  Upon review of the record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date cannot be granted.

The Board has reviewed the entire claims file, paying particular attention to any submissions to VA prior to December 28, 2022.  However, the Veteran's file is devoid of any claim, communication, or examination report that pertains to his right shoulder disability.  The first claim of record after the final decision in July 2015, is the claim that the Veteran filed and was received by VA on December 28, 2022.  See December 2022, VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  Given such, the date of claim, can be no earlier than December 28, 2022.

Additionally, the medical evidence is negative for any factually ascertainable increase in disability of the Veteran's right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis prior to his currently assigned effective date and within the one-year period prior to his December 2022 claim.  Notably, there were no treatment records from this period.  The Veteran has not argued such and has not presented any specific argument for the earlier effective date claim.  There is simply no evidence showing a factually ascertainable increase in disability for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis prior to the current effective date of December 28, 2022.  Essentially, the Veteran's entitlement did not arise until after his application was filed when he presented to a January 2023 VA Shoulder and Arm Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).  Given that the date of claim has been assigned and the Veteran has received a greater benefit, the Board will not adjust the effective as it is a favorable finding.

Nonetheless, as there are no unadjudicated claims for an increased rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis received prior to July 21, 2016, and no competent evidence demonstrating that an increase in disability was factually ascertainable between December 28, 2021 and December 28, 2022, the effective date of the assignment of a 20 percent rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis cannot be earlier than the date that the increased rating claim was received, December 28, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Absent a clear and unmistakable error (CUE), which claim, the Veteran has not filed, an earlier effective date cannot be awarded.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to December 28, 2022, for the assignment of a 20 percent rating for right shoulder acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis must be denied.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Board is grateful for the Veteran's service, and regrets that it cannot render a favorable decision in this matter.
