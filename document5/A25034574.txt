REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran honorably served on active duty in the United States Army National Guard from June 1996 to August 1996, and September 2013 to July 2014. See DD Form 214. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied entitlement to an effective date prior to June 16, 2021, for a 100 percent disability rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder and for DEA eligibility. VA received the Veteran's notice of disagreement (NOD), via VA Form 10182, in June 2023, whereon the Veteran selected the Board's direct review docket. See June 2023 VA Form 10182. 

Applicable Evidentiary Window

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered. See Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). 

Total Disability Rating Based on Unemployability

A total disability rating based on unemployability may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. In order for the Veteran to meet the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU, if there is only one service-connected disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more service-connected disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

While the general rating schedule is based on the "average impairment in earning capacity caused by a disability," entitlement to a TDIU is based on the individual's particular circumstances. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). 

A claim for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability asks for TDIU because of 'subjective' factors, to include the Veteran's education, training, and work history, that the 'objective' rating does not consider. See Vettese v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 31, 34-35 (1994). In determining whether a veteran can secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation, the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" is defined in § 4.16(b) as to include two components: one economic and one noneconomic. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The non-economic component includes consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue, provided that discussion of any factor is only necessary if the evidence raises it. Id.

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to secure or follow employment. The ultimate question, however, is whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). Additionally, the central inquiry in determining entitlement to a TDIU is whether service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. See Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993).

The ultimate question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; rather, that determination is for the adjudicator. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU, effective from July 11, 2016.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 28, 2017, for a 100 percent rating for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

The Veteran is an Army National Guard Veteran whose last period of active-duty service ended on July 25, 2014. After July 2014, she continued to serve in the Army National Guard on inactive status, doing drill weekends, until on July 11, 2016, when the Army determined she was unfit for duty based on her psychiatric disability. See July 2018 Government Treatment Record. 

The Veteran, through her representative, contends that she should receive a TDIU from July 26, 2014, the date following her last period of active-duty service. See June 2023 VA Form 10182. Specifically, the Veteran argues that she continuously pursued her claim for service connection for PTSD since July 2014. See July 2023 Third Party Correspondence, p.10. Moreover, the Veteran argues that new and material evidence showing an increase in the psychiatric disability was presented or received within a year of each rating decision since July 2014, and that the AOJ failed to determine the character of this evidence, thus causing the claim for an increased rating to remain pending since July 2014. Id.

The Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was rated at 50 percent from July 25, 2014, to May 17, 2018, at 70 percent from May 17, 2018, to June 16, 2021, and at 100 percent thereafter. The Veteran is also service-connected for: GERD with a rating of 10 percent from July 25, 2014, to June 20, 2016, and 60 percent thereafter; migraines with a noncompensable rating from July 25, 2014, to June 20, 2016, and a 50 percent rating thereafter; for left carpal tunnel rated at 30 percent on and from December 5, 2014; a right carpal tunnel rated at 10 percent from December 5, 2014, to June 20, 2016, and at 20 percent thereafter; degenerative disc disease rated at 20 percent on and from June 16, 2021; right and left lower extremity radiculopathy respectively rated at 20 percent on and from June 16, 2021; right wrist scar rated at 10 percent on and from July 25, 2014; alopecia rated noncompensable on and from July 25, 2014, and allergic rhinitis rated noncompensable on and from August 28, 2023.

The Veteran's combined rating was of 60 percent from July 25, 2014, to December 5, 2014, 80 percent from December 5, 2014, to June 20, 2016, and 100 percent thereafter. The Veteran meets the criteria for a schedular TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Generally, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(i); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2). 

The effective date will generally date back to the date of an earlier claim if that claim was still pending on the date of the award. See Williams v. Peake, 521 F.3d 1348, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Specifically, a claim remains pending where VA fails to fulfill a statutory duty under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) to determine the character of evidence received within the one-year appeal period following issuance of a rating decision. See Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r). VA then has an obligation to decide whether the evidence received is new and material to allow finality to attach. Id. In this context, all relevant and reasonably connected VA-generated documents, in particular records created in the course of medical care provided by VA, are "received" into the record and are constructively known by VA adjudicators. See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

In determining when an increase is "factually ascertainable," VA will look at all of the evidence including testimonial evidence and expert medical opinions as to when the increase took place. VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

The Veteran was first service-connected for her acquired psychiatric disorder with an evaluation of 50 percent on and from July 25, 2014. See December 2014 Rating Decision. In March 2015, the Veteran filed a new claim asking to be service connected for PTSD based on military sexual trauma, in addition to her already service-connected major depressive disorder with anxious distress. In June 2015, a VA examiner confirmed a diagnosis of PTSD related to service and found that the severity of her disability was overall increasing. See June 2016 VA Examination Report. Based on that examination, a November 2015 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD, recharacterized the rating to include the PTSD, but it continued the 50 percent evaluation for the psychiatric disability. In June 2016, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for her acquired psychiatric disorder. In July 2016, the Veteran was afforded a new VA mental disorders examination, at which time the Veteran endorsed an increase in her functional impairment due to her psychiatric disability, affecting her employability, as she explained that at work, due to her irritability, she was moved from a customer service role to a different role that did not involve any contact with the public. See July 2016 VA Examination Report. An August 2016 rating decision continued her 50 percent rating for PTSD, depression and anxiety. In May 2017, the Veteran was afforded a new VA mental disorders examination; however, shortly after entering the room, the Veteran became very tearful, and told the examiner she could not continue the examination and requested to see a mental health provider right away. See May 2017 VA Examination Report. During the May 2017 walk-in, mental health consultation, the Veteran shared that her psychiatric symptoms impacted her ability to maintain employment since 2014, when she returned home from Afghanistan, and her ability to maintain an effective relationship with her children. See May 2017 Capri Record. Also, more VA treatment records were added to the claims file during that time, showing an increase in her psychiatric symptoms and in functional impairment, particularly impacting her ability to secure and follow gainful employment. See April 2017 Capri Record. A May 2017 rating decision continued her 50 percent rating again. Within a year of the May 2017 rating decision, VA treatment records added to the claims file show that the Veteran had auditory hallucinations, had become paranoid and believed that an inmate that attacked her while she was working as corrections officer at a prison would come find her and kill her, and showing that her ability to complete activities of daily living became severely diminished due to her psychiatric symptoms. See May 2018 VA Treatment Record. In May 2018, within a year of the May 2017 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 application for unemployability along with a private mental health evaluation. Also, more VA treatment records showing an increase in the severity of her psychiatric disability were added to the claims file at that time. See, e.g., May 2018 and June 2018 VA Treatment Record, and May 2018 VA Form 21-8940. A July 2018 rating decision granted a 70 percent increase on and from May 17, 2018, the date of the intent to file an increased rating claim. In January and February 2019, within one year of the July 2018 rating decision, more VA treatment records were added to the claims file, and these records show that the Veteran at that point was psychotic, had persistent hallucinations, with intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, to include maintain her personal hygiene. See January 2019 and February 2019 Capri Records. Finally, on June 16, 2021, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for her PTSD on a supplemental claim form, and an August 2021 rating decision granted a 100 percent rating on and from June 16, 2021, the date of her most recent increased rating claim. However, the June 2021 rating decision did not determine the character of the evidence received after the July 2018 rating decision, and whether the July 2018 rating became final. In July 2022, the Veteran filed a higher-level review asking for an earlier effective date for her 100 percent evaluation for PTSD with depression and anxiety. In September 2022, the AOJ denied an earlier effective date prior to June 16, 2021, for the 100 percent rating, and made the finding that the July 2018 rating decision became final, but it did not discuss the new and relevant evidence received since the July 2018 rating decision. See Beraud, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Then the Veteran filed a December 2022 supplemental claim requesting an earlier effective date prior to June 16, 2021, for the 100 percent rating for the psychiatric disability. In March 2023, the RO denied her earlier effective date claim and did not discuss the finality of the July 2018 rating decision. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the July 2018 rating decision, and all the prior rating decisions back to the July 2014 claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, were not final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2012); Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1407; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (2012). As a result, the Veteran's September 2014 original claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability remained pending. Beraud, 766 F.3d at 1407. 

The remaining question for the Board is when entitlement arose. 

For the reasons detailed below, the Board concludes that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms rendered her unable to secure or follow gainful employment on and from July 11, 2016, the date the Army found that her PTSD with depression and anxiety prevented her from meeting retention standards, based on which the Veteran was medically separated from the Army National Guard. See June 2018 Service Treatment Record. Moreover, the evidence supports that on and from December 28, 2017, the Veteran's symptoms manifested with a total occupational and social impairment. See, e.g., April 2017 Capri Record, June 2018 VA Form 21-4192 Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability. 

With respect to the Veteran's employment history, the evidence shows that until April 1, 2015, the Veteran was employed as full-time corrections officer at a state prison. The Veteran did not contend that her employment for the state prison was marginal. 

Moreover, the Veteran was on inactive status doing drill weekends with the Army National Guard until July 2016, when she was medically separated due to her PTSD with depression and anxiety. 

With respect to her full-time employment as corrections officer, in January 2015, the Veteran was stabbed with a knife by an inmate, and went on sick leave until April 1, 2015, when she quit her job reporting that this traumatic event further aggravated her psychiatric symptoms. See April 2017 VA Treatment Record.

The evidence further shows that from May 4, 2015, to August 1, 2016, the Veteran worked part-time at a post office. Id. When talking with her medical providers at times she referred to it as a job at the post office, and at times as working at FedEx. Id. The VA Form 21-4192 filled by her employer shows that the job was part-time, with a work week of 24-30 hours. See June 2018 VA Form 21-4192. However, the Veteran's treatment record from June 2016 to August 2016, shows that the Veteran reported working there 8 hours a day for some time due to shortage of personnel, and complained of her schedule and her wrist pain secondary to her carpal tunnel. Id. Then in August 2016, during a follow-up appointment with her psychiatrist, the Veteran reported that she started to work reduced hours due to her mental health issues and her anxiety being through the roof, and she complained that "the meds are not doing much to help me with how fearful [I still] am day to day. I handle packages and boxes and every day I just think about the packets as bombs that could go off any time. I just cannot stop thinking about how unpredictable and dangerous the world is" Id. She endorsed significant intrusive thoughts and did not appear to be future oriented, but she denied active or passive suicidal ideations, or psychosis. Id. 

The VA Form 21-4192, which was filled out by her employer, indicates that her last day of part-time employment was August 1, 2016. See June 2018 VA Form 21-4192. The Veteran's treatment record indicates that in August 2016 she reported working part-time again, and then going on extended unpaid leave until December 2016, when she reported to her medical provider that she quit her job at the post office. See April 2017 Capri Record. 

In light of the above, the evidence demonstrates that until July 11, 2016, the Veteran was found fit to serve for the Army National Guard, and that she could have been activated at any time prior to July 11, 2016. This finding is incompatible with a finding of individual unemployability. Moreover, the evidence shows that prior to July 11, 2016, the Veteran was capable of full-time work, as the evidence shows that for some time prior to July 11, 2016, she worked full time for the post office to compensate for some shortage of personnel.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of individual unemployability based on her psychiatric disability alone prior to July 11, 2016. 

On and from July 11, 2016, when she was medically retired from the Army National Guard, the evidence supports that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms rendered her unable to secure or follow gainful employment. 

Specifically, the evidence shows that she tried to complete a bachelor's degree to requalify in a different industry, and she was also approved for vocational rehabilitation with the VA but failed some tests and paused her studies while she continued to work. See April 2017 VA Record. In November 2016, she discussed with her medical provider her intent to resume her studies but endorsed problems with concentration and focus. Id. Moreover, the evidence shows that the Veteran became more paranoid while working at the post office, and she was fearful that in one of the packages there could be a bomb. Id. 

During a December 2016 virtual mental health appointment, the Veteran endorsed symptoms of severe depression, anxiety with panic attacks, concentration difficulty, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, irritability, loss of interest in people and things, chronic pain, loss of energy, depressed mood and fatigue, nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance of internal and external triggers, physical reactions to triggers, guilt and shame, intense anger and sadness, being jumpy and easily startled, avoiding public places and crowds, and feeling like a failure and being "here with no purpose, I can't do anything." Id. The Veteran, however, endorsed improvements in her symptoms since quitting her job, spending most of her day in bed, but denying suicidal or homicidal ideations or psychosis. Id. In January 2017, she was encouraged to go to the grocery store more often as her daughter was the one who would normally handle the grocery shopping. Id. At that time, her mental status exam was good, she presented appropriately dressed, with normal grooming and hygiene, was calm and cooperative, and mood was congruent, her speech normal, her memory intact, and she appeared oriented in all spheres, her judgment was fair, and there was no evidence of delusions or psychosis. Id. 

In February 2017, she reported improvements in her symptoms and better sleep after an adjustment to her medication and had a more future-oriented attitude, but endorsed continued nightmares a few times a month, anxiety, and irritability. Id. Her memory was intact, she was oriented in all spheres, had good judgment and insight, and denied any active or passive suicidal or homicidal ideations or psychotic symptoms. Id. During the March 2017 group therapy session, she was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation, she was pleasant and cooperative throughout the group session, and she was an active participant in group conversations, she exhibited no difficulty understanding presented concepts during the group. Id. 

In May 2017, as discussed above, the Veteran was afforded a new VA mental disorders examination; however, shortly after entering the room, the Veteran became very tearful and requested to interrupt the examination to see a mental health provider right away. See May 2017 VA Examination Report. During the May 2017 walk-in, mental health consultation, the Veteran reiterated that her psychiatric symptoms impacted her ability to maintain gainful employment since 2014, when she returned home from Afghanistan, and her struggle with manifesting her love and affection to her children. See May 2017 Capri Record. 

On December 28, 2017, the Veteran presented for a tele-psychiatric appointment, at which time the Veteran endorsed worsening of her depression, with crying spells every other day, anhedonia, feeling anxious, low energy, hypervigilant and paranoid, she was scared that someone was going to hurt her, and was having flashback, sleep disturbances, and auditory hallucinations, which increased in frequency after taking one of her prescribed medications. See June 2018 VA Treatment Record. She reported hearing two different voices but denied suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent or plan. Id. The psychiatrist noted that the Veteran appeared oriented in all spheres but was tearful during the appointment, her speech was low in volume, her judgment was fair, and thought process was linear, but there was some moderate psychomotor retardation. Id. The psychiatrist indicated that persecutory delusion was evident. Id. 

Since the December 28, 2017, appointment, the evidence shows that the Veteran consistently reported hearing voices and having persecutory delusions about being found and killed by the inmate that attacked her in 2015. See June 2018 VA Treatment Records. Moreover, the evidence shows that the Veteran stopped doing chores or going out of the house, and that her daughter became fully in charge of cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, going grocery shopping, and taking care of her brother. Id. 

In June 2018, the Veteran also endorsed passive suicidal ideations, with her children being a strong protective factor. Id. Also in June 2018, the Veteran's long-time VA psychiatrist indicated that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were moderate to severe and that she was unemployable. See June 2018 VA Treatment Record. At the July 2018 VA examination, the Veteran recounted that she was instructed to go to a mall and while she was there, someone touched her, and she ran outside and almost got hit by a car. See July 2018 VA Examination Report. She also endorsed depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-life setting. Id. The examiner indicated that the Veteran was wearing a scarf and a hat as disguise so nobody would know who she was, and she exhibited mild anxiety symptoms as evidenced by twisting a Kleenex in her hands and tearing it up. Id. The Veteran reported intrusive thoughts, increased startle reactions, hypervigilance, and preoccupation with past events, her mood was depressed, her affect was flat. Id. the Veteran reported hearing voices 5 to 6 times a day telling her she is worthless and will never amount to anything. Id. The cognitive assessment indicated that she was having difficulties with visuospatial, language, similarities and delayed recall. Id. Her insight and judgment appeared to be adequate to mildly impaired based on her belief that she will not be identified or recognized because she wears a hat, scarf, warm jacket and long pants in the middle of the summer. Id. Moreover, the Veteran endorsed recent suicidal plan, when she started to cut herself with a broken mirror, but she stopped when her daughter started crying. Id. The Veteran reported difficulty with concentration which gets her very angry easily and being very forgetful. Id. For example, once she forgot her son's birthday, and another time she put some beans on the stove, forgot about them, and her house almost burned down. Id. With respect to her ability to perform activities of daily living, the Veteran indicated that her daughter was in charge of the house, her brother and the finances. Id. 

At the July 2021 VA PTSD examination, the examiner confirmed the same disability picture described above, with persistent auditory hallucinations. See July 2021 VA Examination Report. 

In light of the record as a whole, the Board finds that the Veteran was unemployable due to her PTSD with a major depressive disorder and anxious distress on and from July 11, 2016, and that on and from December 28, 2017, her PTSD with major depressive disorder and anxious distress manifested with a total occupational and social impairment. Thus, entitlement to a total disability rating, first based on unemployability, and then based on total occupational and social impairment, arose as of July 11, 2016. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes that an effective date of July 11, 2016, but not earlier, for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability is warranted. Moreover, entitlement to an earlier effective date of December 28, 2017, but not earlier, for a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder and anxious distress is also granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

3. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 11, 2016, for the eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 USC chapter 35.

Eligibility to DEA is related to a finding that the Veteran has a total disability due to service that is permanent in nature. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

In this case, the Board found that on and from July 11, 2016, the Veteran has a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to her PTSD with depression and anxiety. Moreover, on and from December 28, 2017, the Veteran also has a 100 percent disability rating for her PTSD with depression and anxiety. 

In light of the above, entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 11, 2016, for the Veteran's DEA eligibility is granted as a matter of law. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.
