ORDER

Entitlement to a HISA Grant in excess of $6800 is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

In June 2022, the Veteran was awarded the maximum lifetime HISA grant of $6800.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a HISA Grant in excess of $6800 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1710(a)(2)(C), 1717(a)(2)(A)(ii); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3105(b)(2)(ii), (e)(1).     

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1958 to April 1961 and from June 1961 to May 1964.     

This matter is on appeal before the Board of Veterans Appeals (Board) from a June 2022 decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In September 2022, a notice of disagreement selecting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge was received. 

Entitlement to a HISA Grant in excess of $6800.

In the June 2022 decision, the AOJ approved the Veteran's application for a Home Improvement Structural Alterations (HISA) grant in the amount of $6800 for improvements to his bathroom, including installation of a walk-in shower.  On his September 2022 NOD, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing the amount of the grant.  In a statement accompanying the NOD, the Veteran requested that VA review the amount granted.  He noted that in addition to the walk-in shower, he needed a walk-in bathtub for therapeutic needs, as well as for daily living needs.  He reported that he was no longer able to bathe himself in a safe and thorough way and had recently fallen due to not being able to safely bathe himself.

As part of home health services, HISA benefits may be furnished to a beneficiary for home improvements and structural alterations up to certain listed amounts.  38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(2)(ii).  The purpose of the HISA benefits program is to provide eligible beneficiaries monetary benefits for home improvements and structural alterations when such improvements and structural alterations: (1) are necessary for the continuation of the provision of home health treatment of the beneficiary's disability; or (2) provide the beneficiary with access to the home or with access to essential lavatory and sanitary facilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1717(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 17.3100(a).  The lifetime benefit amount for HISA grants to a veteran may not exceed $6800.  See 38 C.F.R. § 17.3105(b)(2), (e)(1).   

The above summarized evidence indicates that the Veteran has already been awarded $6800, the maximum amount of lifetime HISA benefits.  The Board recognizes the Veteran's reasons for requesting additional HISA benefits, including the need to bathe in a safe manner.  However, the Board is bound to follow the controlling regulation, which does not allow for awarding HISA benefits in excess of $6800.  Accordingly, the Board must deny this appeal as a matter of law.  38 C.F.R. § 17.3105(b)(2), (e)(1).
