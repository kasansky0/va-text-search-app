REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation prior to June 28, 2023, and an evaluation higher than 10 percent for service-connected sinusitis, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1990 to November 1996.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from May, November, and December 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) in March 2024, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1). Under the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the rating decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claims. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Sinusitis

Under the AMA, only pre-decisional duty to assist errors are eligible for remand by the Board.

A review of the evidence of record includes a treatment records in June 2022, which indicates the Veteran has a history of sinus surgery. During an August 2022 VA examination, he reported he had undergone rhinoplasty surgery. Also, during a March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that he underwent a deviated septum surgery in 1995. 

However, the claims file is devoid of any treatment notes with respect to these surgeries. The record also does not document that the AOJ attempted to obtain the treatment notes prior to the December 2023 rating decision on appeal.

Therefore, because the AOJ was on notice of the existence of potentially relevant records that were reasonably identified prior to the decision on appeal but did not attempt to obtain these records, the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to attempt to obtain these outstanding records. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

As such, while the Board sincerely regrets further delay, the Board finds that remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. Specifically, remand is required to obtain the Veteran's outstanding treatment records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Ask the Veteran to submit and/or complete the required authorization forms for private treatment records he received for his service-connected sinusitis that have not already been associated with the claims file. The record reflects that the Veteran reported a history of sinus surgery, including a rhinoplasty surgery and/or a deviated septum surgery in 1995. After obtaining any necessary authorization from the Veteran, all identified, outstanding records should be obtained and associated with the claims file.
