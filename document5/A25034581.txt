REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle condition, to include secondary to service-connected right knee, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2007 to March 2008 and from November 2011 to October 2012.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the AMA, applies.

In August 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2022 decision.  In September 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2022 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 rating decision.

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran timely appealed the September 2022 rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

In November 2022, the Board notified the Veteran that the appeal has been placed on the docket.  Thus, the appeal is properly before the Board, and this decision follows.

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle condition, to include secondary to service-connected right knee, is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a left ankle condition.  The Veteran asserts that he has pain, cracking, and popping in his left ankle associated with weight gain developed from his inability to exercise due to his service-connected right knee.  See March 2022 Statement in Support of Claim.

In general, to prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may also be established by credible lay evidence and medical evidence provided by the Veteran or otherwise.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

A current or present disability is one that existed either at the time of the filing of the claim and/or during the pendency of the claim.  A disability that existed during the claim period but resolved before the claim was adjudicated may still satisfy the current disability element.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  Additionally, a disability that was diagnosed shortly before a claim was filed may constitute evidence of a current disability.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

On February 8, 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination filed on March 15, 2022.  The examiner evaluated and made a nexus opinion for the Veteran's right ankle.  See March 15, 2022 VA Examination.  The examiner did not diagnose a left ankle condition but noted the Veteran had an unclaimed, damaged left ankle.  Id.

On May 9, 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination filed on May 15, 2022.  The examiner stated that there was no objective evidence to support a diagnosis for the Veteran's left ankle and no pathology to render a left ankle diagnosis.  See May 15, 2022 VA Examination.  However, the examiner did not address all relevant evidence such as an unclaimed, damaged left ankle noted in the March 15, 2022 VA examination.  See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (without a medical opinion that clearly addresses the relevant facts and medical science, the Board is left to rely on its own lay opinion, which it is forbidden from doing).  As the AOJ had not sought an addendum, there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is necessary to address this deficiency.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made).

The matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate examiner to address the Veteran's service connection claim for a left ankle condition.  The examiner must identify all current diagnoses relevant to the claimed left ankle.  For each diagnosis, if any, the examiner must address the following: 

(A) The examiner must determine the nature and etiology of any such diagnosis and opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such diagnosis is due to the Veteran's military service.

(B) The examiner must opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that such diagnosis was caused and/or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected right knee.  Note that aggravation means any incremental increase in disability in non-service-connected disabilities (i.e., any additional impairment of earning capacity) resulting from service-connected conditions.  Separate opinions and detailed rationales are required for both causation and aggravation. 

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached.  The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.  Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered and weighed in making the determination.  

All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered.  If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
