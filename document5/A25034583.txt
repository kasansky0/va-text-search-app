REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from November 1990 to June 1991, to include service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. He had additional periods of service with the Army National Guard of Pennsylvania.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Any evidence submitted after the rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that it has recharacterized the Veteran's claim for low back strain more broadly to a low back disability, in order to clarify the nature of the benefit sought and ensure complete consideration of the claim. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5-6 (2009).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is remanded.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted in order to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. 

First, the Veteran's private medical treatment records received by VA in March 2023 note that "He saw the [physician assistant] to address his back pain and shoulder pain for which he was to get him a referral to orthopedic. We are still waiting for an orthopedic referral." However, review of the claims file does not show that the AOJ attempted to obtain such records.

Second, in December 2023 and February 2024, the AOJ obtained VA examinations for the claimed low back disability, which diagnosed degenerative arthritis. The AOJ also obtained a medical opinion, which is against service connection, reasoning that the only back complaints noted in the file are dated 2023. However, the examiner did not address the potentially favorable medical and lay evidence of record. Furthermore, the examiner did not address another theory of entitlement raised by the record, as arthritis constitutes a chronic disease for which presumptive service connection may be warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Accordingly, a new opinion is required. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (holding that once VA undertakes an examination, it must provide an adequate one); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 553 (2008), aff'd sub nom. Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Third, in December 2023 and February 2024, the AOJ obtained a VA examination for the claimed left shoulder disability, which diagnosed left shoulder strain, and a medical opinion. The medical opinion is against service connection, reasoning that "there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of left shoulder strain and military service." However, this is not the evidentiary standard. Moreover, a formal finding regarding the unavailability of his service records was associated with the claims file in July 2023. Accordingly, a new opinion is required. See Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311.

The Board notes that remands are interlocutory in nature and that it is not making any findings herein regarding the credibility of the Veteran's lay statements.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain any outstanding private/non-VA medical treatment records for the Veteran's claimed left shoulder disability. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 (Authorization for Release of Information) for such records. Any inability to obtain these records should be documented pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e).

2. Thereafter, obtain an addendum opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed low back disability from the VA examiner who performed the February 2024 examination or an appropriate medical professional if the examiner is unavailable. A new examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the examiner. The claims file, as updated, must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. The examiner is asked to opine on the following:

(a)	Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the currently diagnosed low back disability is etiologically related to the Veteran's active service?

(b)	Alternatively, did the Veteran's degenerative arthritis (1) begin during active service, (2) manifest within one year after discharge from service, or (3) was noted during service with continuity of the same symptomatology since service?

The Board calls the examiner's attention to the following records: (i) DD Form 214 noting an military occupational specialty (MOS) of Heavy Wheel Vehicle Mechanic and service in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; (ii) February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ indicating that the Veteran's low back strain was caused by too much heavy lifting of heavy equipment while serving in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; (iii) February 2023 VA treatment records showing that the Veteran reported the presence of chronic back pain and a long history of low back spasms, which he treated with Flexeril, as needed; (iv) December 2023 VA examination for back conditions, wherein the Veteran reported that the onset of the claimed disability was in 1991 when he developed low back pain due to the physical demands and heavy lifting associated with his service, such as manually changing over 100 tires on 18-wheeler tractor trailers, and that the course since onset has been that the condition has progressively worsened to the point where his pain is now radiating into his thoracic spine as well as through his buttocks and hamstring area; and (v) July 2023 Final Attempt Letter indicating that the Veteran's service records were not located.

3. Following completion of directive #1, obtain an addendum opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed left shoulder disability from the VA examiner who performed the December 2023 examination or an appropriate medical professional if the examiner is unavailable. A new examination of the Veteran is only necessary if deemed so by the examiner. The claims file, as updated, must be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner. The examiner is asked to opine on whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the currently diagnosed left shoulder disability is etiologically related to the Veteran's active service. 

The Board calls the examiner's attention to the following records: (i) DD Form 214 noting an MOS of Heavy Wheel Vehicle Mechanic and service in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; (ii) February 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ indicating that his shoulder condition was caused by lifting and carrying heavy equipment and tires while serving in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; (iii) February 2023 VA treatment record  noting chronic left shoulder discomfort; and (iv) July 2023 Final Attempt Letter indicating that the Veteran's service records were not located.
