REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome of the left knee with limitation of extension is remanded.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of flexion is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to February 2020.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to a March 2023 higher-level review request.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for patellofemoral pain syndrome of the left knee with limitation of extension is remanded.

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of flexion is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his left knee limitation of extension and limitation of flexion warrant higher ratings and earlier effective dates.  In pertinent part, the Veteran challenges the VA examiners' competence and requested their credentials.  See March 2023 Decision Review Request:  Higher-Level Review.

The Board finds that a remand is warranted in order to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors.  In this regard, the Veteran has received two VA examinations.  The first was completed in January 2021 and the physician assistant (C.M.'s) credentials were provided in a January 2021 letter.

In preparation of the Veteran's scheduled August 2021 VA examination, a letter was sent to the Veteran in July 2021 with the name and credentials of nurse practitioner (NP) O.N.  However, his August 2021 VA examination was signed by NP J.N., and not until November 2021.  See November 2021 C&P Exam (2x).

The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the November 2022 rating decision, in part raising an objection to the August 2021 VA examiner's competence, as well as requesting credentials.  At the Veteran's June 2023 higher-level review informal conference, the Veteran restated his left knee contentions and also noted that the August 2021 VA examiner, NP J.N., was not a certified examiner in the VA system for the Veteran's VA examinations.  Concurrent with the informal conference, the Veteran submitted his written contention that NP J.N. was not a certified clinician that could perform VA examinations.  See March 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review; June 2023 HLR - Informal Conference; June 2023 Third Party Correspondence.

The June 2023 rating decision did not address the Veteran's contention that NP J.N. was certified to perform the VA examination, and the claims file is absent credentials and/or a curriculum vitae (CV) for NP J.N. being provided to the Veteran or his representative.  See June 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative.

Upon review, a remand is warranted in order to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal.  In this regard, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Court) has held that once a request is made for information as to the competency of an examiner, "the Veteran has the right, absent unusual circumstances, to the curriculum vitae and other information about qualifications of a medical examiner.  This is mandated by the VA's duty to assist."  Francway v. Wilkie, 940 F.3d 1304, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

Here, the Board notes that the Veteran was sent credentials for NP O.N. prior to his August 2021 VA examination.  However, the August 2021 VA examination appears to have been performed by NP J.N.  As such, a remand is required to address the representative's request for information pertaining to the qualifications of NP J.N.
