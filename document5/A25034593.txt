ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as due to the service-connected generalized anxiety disorder with cannabis use disorder (psychiatric disability) with obesity as an intermediary step, is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is caused or aggravated by his service-connected psychiatric disorder with obesity as an intermediate step.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected psychiatric disability with obesity as an intermediate step, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1990 to March 1994.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for veterans disagreeing with VA's decision on their claim. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 AMA rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), previously referred to as the Regional Office (RO). 

In October 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested Direct Review by the Board. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

SERVICE CONNECTION - OSA 

The Veteran contends that the service-connected psychiatric disability caused him to become obese and the obesity either caused or aggravated the current OSA. See July 2023 Statement in Support of Claim; see also, VA Form 10182, October 18, 2024. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). "To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"- the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established for a current disability on the basis of a presumption that certain chronic diseases, including psychosis, manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service must have had their onset in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a). Generally, the disease must have manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(3). 

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). VA has amended 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 to explicitly incorporate the holding in Allen, except that it will not concede aggravation unless a baseline for the claimed disability can be established with evidence created prior to any aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

With regard to the contention that the service-connected disabilities caused obesity, VA's General Counsel interpreted that obesity is not a disease or injury for purposes of 38 C.F.R. §§ 1110 and 1131 and, therefore, may not be considered an "in-service event" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(4) for the purposes of establishing service connection for a disease that is diagnosed after service discharge, so direct service connection is precluded. General Counsel also interpreted that obesity may not be service connected on a secondary basis as a disability directly resulting from a veteran's service-connected disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

VA General Counsel interpreted that obesity may act as an "intermediate step" to establish proximate causation between a service-connected disability and a current disability that may be service connected on a secondary basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Id. at 7-9. In order to establish a service-connected disability proximately caused by the current disability through obesity, the adjudicator must determine: (1) whether the service-connected disability caused the veteran to become obese; (2) if so, whether the obesity as a result of the service-connected disability was a substantial factor in causing the current disability; and (3) whether the current disability would not have occurred but for obesity caused by the service-connected disability. Id. at 9-10. If all of the above questions are answered in the affirmative, then the current disability may be service connected on a secondary basis. Id. at 10.

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran is service connected for a psychiatric disability, has a current disability of OSA, and experienced an in-service sleep event. 

The Board notes that the Veteran has been diagnosed with obesity. See May 2022 VA Treatment Records. 

In a July 2023 private evaluation, the private doctor opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's weight gain and obesity is due to and/or related to the service-connected psychiatric disability and it is at least as likely as not that the OSA is "secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by" the weight gain and obesity from the service-connected psychiatric disability. The private doctor explained that the Veteran has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 38, meeting the national standard for obesity. The private doctor cited to medical studies proving that obesity is associated with anxiety disorder, specifically noting that "food intake is altered by endocrine processes, which are related to disturbances in mood, to include anxiety and/or depressive symptomatology." The private doctor then explained that upper airway anatomy plays a major role in OSA pathogenesis, and that obesity has been associated with functional impairment and weakening in the upper airway muscles. The private doctor noted that "even a one standard deviation increase in body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a 4-fold increase in the prevalence of OSA. The private doctor noted that the Veteran gained 65 pounds since service separation. In addition, the private doctor noted obesity and weight gain was the number one risk factor of developing obstructive sleep apnea. 

In the August 2023 VA examination, the VA examiner opined that the OSA is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected psychiatric disability. The VA examiner reasoned that the Veteran's obesity, alcohol use, and sinusitis outweigh the potential effects of the service-connected psychiatric disability.

The Board finds the August 2023 VA medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached and did not provide an opinion for direct service connection. In addition, the August 2023 VA examination opinion does not adequately address the Veteran's secondary service connection claim with obesity as an intermediate step. When VA undertakes to either provide an examination or to obtain an opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). Accordingly, this opinion is afforded little, if any, probative weight. 

In contrast, the Board affords the July 2023 private medical opinion highly probative. The private doctor provided a thorough review and assessment of both the Veteran and his lay statements, including medical literature and resources consulted. In addition, the private doctor considered the lay statements and contentions of the Veteran, and provided an opinion supported by a clear rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). Further, the private doctor considered the Veteran's circumstances of his service, to include the impact of his primary service-connected disability when rendering the opinions. Accordingly, this opinion is afforded high probative weight. 

In sum, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The only probative opinion of record is in support of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection. Moreover, there is no sufficient basis for the Board to reject this supportive opinion and to further develop the claim. Cf. Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003) (holding that, because it is not permissible for VA to undertake additional development to obtain evidence against an appellant's case, VA must provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision to pursue such development where such development could be reasonably construed as obtaining additional evidence for that purpose).

Based on the foregoing, and resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea, secondary to service-connected psychiatric disability with obesity as an intermediate step, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
