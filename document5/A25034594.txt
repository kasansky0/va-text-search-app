ORDER

Entitlement to recognition of the Appellant as the Veteran's surviving spouse for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) purposes is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran married the Appellant in July 1977.

2.  The Veteran and the Appellant divorced in January 1998.

3.  The Veteran died in January 2008 after his divorce from the Appellant.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for recognition of the Appellant as the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 101(3), 103; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(j), 3.5, 3.50.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active U.S. Army service from July 1973 to July 1975.  He died in January 2008.  

The rating decision letter on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board only may consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, then she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20 0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Appellant has not raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369 370 (2017) (confirming that Board not required to address issues unless specifically raised by claimant or reasonably raised by record evidence).

The Board is not persuaded that the Appellant is entitled to recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes.  She essentially contends that, although she and the Veteran divorced several decades prior to his death and she did not remarry after his death, she is entitled to recognition as his surviving spouse based on their prior marriage.  The Board disagrees.  Contrary to the Appellant's lay assertions, the record evidence demonstrates that she is not entitled to recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes.

The governing law and regulations provided that a Veteran's surviving spouse may qualify for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits, death compensation, death pension, survivors pension, and/or accrued benefits, collectively known as death benefits, provided that certain requirements are satisfied.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(14), 1102(a)(2), 1310, 1311, 1541; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.5, 3.54, 3.1000.  VA death benefits may be paid to a surviving spouse who was married to a Veteran (1) one year or more prior to a Veteran's death, or (2) for any period of time if a child was born of the marriage, or (3) was born to them before the marriage.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1102, 1304, 1541; 38 C.F.R. § 3.54.  The term "surviving spouse" means a person who was the spouse of the Veteran at the time of a Veteran's death and who lived with the Veteran continuously from the date of marriage to the date of a Veteran's death (except where there was a separation which was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, a Veteran without the fault of the spouse in the case of temporary separations) and who has not remarried or (in cases not involving remarriage) has not since the death of a Veteran lived with another person and held himself or herself out openly to the public to be the spouse of such other person.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101 (3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50.  For purposes of VA benefits, marriage means a marriage valid under law of the place where the parties resided at the time of the marriage, or the law of the place where the parties resided when the right to benefits accrued.  38 C.F.R. § 103(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(j).

Here, it is undisputed that the Veteran and the Appellant married in July 1977 and divorced in January 1998.  It also is undisputed that the Veteran died in January 2008, approximately 20 years after his divorce from the Appellant.  The Veteran's death certificate listed his marital status as divorced at the time of his death.  Although she provided no argument in support of her claim, it appears that the Appellant essentially contends that she is entitled to recognition as the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes based on their prior marriage between July 1977 and January 1988 which ended in divorce.  

The dispositive question in this case is whether the Veteran and the Appellant were married at the time of the Veteran's death.  Here, as the Appellant conceded in statements on her November 2023 VA Form 21-534EZ which initiated her current appeal, she and the Veteran divorced in 1998 and did not remarry.   The Appellant does not contend - and the evidence does not show - that her divorce from the Veteran was not valid.  As the Veteran and the Appellant validly divorced prior to the Veteran's death, the Appellant cannot be considered the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b).  In Haynes, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held that there was no exception to the "clear statutory mandate and regulation" found in 38 U.S.C. § 101(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.50(b) that, to be a "surviving spouse," an Appellant must be validly married to the Veteran at the time of death.  See Haynes v. McDonald, 785 F.3d 614, 616 (Fed. Cir. 2015).  The evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  Therefore, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  In summary, the Board finds that the criteria for recognition of the Appellant as the Veteran's surviving spouse for VA purposes have not been met.  The appeal is denied.
