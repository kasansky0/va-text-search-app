ORDER

Entitlement to a 100 percent rating effective March 30, 2022, but no higher and no earlier, for service-connected major depressive disorder with psychotic features and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation effective March 30, 2022, but no earlier, at the statutory housebound rate is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to any higher awards of special monthly compensation effective March 30, 2022 (initially claimed as aid and attendance) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran initially filed a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (now characterized as major depressive disorder with psychotic features and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood) as early as May 6, 2014, but no later than April 2, 2018.

2. In a February 11, 2021 rating decision, the claim for service connection was granted, and the Agency of Original Jurisdiction assigned an initial 30 percent rating effective April 2, 2018.

3. There is no competent or credible evidence to suggest that the Veteran ever indicated disagreement with either this initial rating or this initial effective date within one year of the February 11, 2021 rating decision; therefore, the February 11, 2021 rating decision is final.

4. After the initial rating became final, this claim for a non-initial rating increase for the service-connected psychiatric disorder was received on March 30, 2022, and claims for higher ratings have been continuously prosecuted ever since.

5. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record is at least evenly balanced to suggest that symptoms of total occupational impairment and total social impairment, which manifested no later than February 24, 2023, were at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) also present effective March 30, 2022.

6. Effective March 30, 2022 and by operation of this Board decision, the Veteran has one service-connected disability rated 100 percent disabling by itself (namely his major depressive disorder), and separate service-connected disabilities independently rated as 60 percent combined or more.  Accordingly, he satisfies statutory requirements for special monthly compensation at the statutory housebound rate throughout this appellate period.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a 100 percent rating effective March 30, 2022, but no higher and no earlier, for service-connected major depressive disorder with psychotic features and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation effective March 30, 2022, but no earlier, at the statutory housebound rate have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§?1114(s), 5107, 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350(i).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1979 to June 1982.  The claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a May 5, 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 8, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 5, 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  The Board is determining that the appellate period only begins on March 30, 2022, so with jurisdiction limited to that date, the Board is simply precluded from awarding any benefits prior to that date.  Instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim, or for a motion to revise on clear and unmistakable error, are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to a 100 percent rating effective March 30, 2022, but no higher and no earlier, for service-connected major depressive disorder with psychotic features and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (hereinafter "psychiatric disorder" or "major depressive disorder") is granted.

A claimant may "limit a claim or appeal to the issue of entitlement to a particular disability rating which is less than the maximum disability rating allowed by law" via "clearly expressed intent to limit the appeal to entitlement to a specific disability rating for the service-connected condition." See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (citing Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 544 (1993)).  The Notice of Disagreement preserves all of the following on appeal:

Correct rating and effective date of major depressive disorder with psychotic features and adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood from 2018 to present.  [The Veteran] should be rated total from October 2017 and should have aid and attendance for psych impairments alone.  This would entitle him to r-1.  At the very least VA should have assigned SMC(s) rating once his psych was total. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)(4).  Generally, VA's failure to correctly rate all disability for all SMC ratings to include [aid and attendance] and SMC(r-1).

See VA Form 10182 (rec'd May 8, 2024), at Part III, Question No. 11A; see also, generally, e.g.: Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991) (finding that a claim for an increased rating can include entitlement to special monthly compensation as an inferred issue); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (stating that special monthly compensation benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim).

In order to afford maximum consideration to the Veteran's and his attorney's arguments (up to and including "from 2018 to present"), the Board will assume that the Veteran is seeking maximum available benefits, with no limitation on any argument.  That being said, the Board still must determine the scope of the effective period over which it can exercise jurisdiction.  The Board concludes that the appellate period can only begin on March 30, 2022.

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation on an original claim for compensation will be the day following separation from?active duty?service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.??38?U.S.C. §?5110(a)-(b)(1);?38?C.F.R. §?3.400(b)(2).

For claims for higher ratings, in general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of increased rating shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of increased compensation may be established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the application for an increased rating is received within one year from that date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 f.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has explained that, in an original claim for service connection, the date entitlement arises is governed by the date the claim is received, not the date of the medical evidence submitted to support a particular claim.??See McGrath v. Gober, 14?Vet. App.?28 (2000).  Where a prior?unappealed?decision becomes final and binding on a Veteran, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of a reopened claim, not the date of receipt of the original claim.? Sears v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?244 (2002);?Melton v. West, 13?Vet. App.?442 (2000). 

Under VA laws and regulations, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the VA must be filed?in order for?benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under laws administered by the VA.??38?U.S.C. §?5101(a);?38?C.F.R. §?3.151(a).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by the VA, and identifying the benefits sought, may be considered an informal claim.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a). 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The Board determines that the standard forms amendment's applicability, or lack thereof, does not appear to be a pertinent issue to this claim, but the Board notes in passing that if jurisdiction is limited to March 30, 2022, then the amendment would apply.

The provisions of?38?U.S.C. §?5101(a) mandate that a claim must be filed?in order for?any type of benefit to accrue or be paid.??See?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998).? Further, the mere presence of medical evidence in the record does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for the benefit in question.??Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-5 (1998).? While the Board must interpret the Veteran's submissions broadly, the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the Veteran.? Id.? 

The word "claim" includes a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a?benefit.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.1(p);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 34-35 (1998);?Servello v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?196, 199 (1992).? Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a Veteran may?be considered to be?an informal claim.? Such an informal claim must identify the benefits sought.? Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution.??38?C.F.R. §?3.155(a).? To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.??See?Quarles v.?Derwinski,?3?Vet. App.?129, 134 (1992). 

From March 25, 2015 forward, a claim for benefits must be filed on the standardized claim form prescribed by the Secretary.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.150, 3.151. A veteran may also indicate their intent to file a claim for compensation by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA must provide the claimant with the appropriate claims form.  Id.  If a complete application for benefits on the form prescribed by the Secretary is received by VA within one year of receipt of the intent to file, VA will consider the formal claim to have been filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. Id.  

In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.?38?C.F.R. §?3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in?38?C.F.R. §?3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.155(b). 

In this regard, VA may not pay a benefit before a claim is made.??38?U.S.C. §?5101;?Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (stating that "[38 U.S.C.A. §] 5101 is a clause of general applicability and mandates that a claim must be filed in order for any type of benefits to... be paid under the laws administered by the Secretary.")? The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a disability.?Lalonde v. West, 12?Vet. App.?377, 382 (1999);?Brannon v. West, 12?Vet. App.?32, 35 (1998).? More specifically, a medical examination report is only considered an informal claim for an increase in disability benefits if service connection has already been established for the disability.??MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006);?see also?38?C.F.R. §?3.157(b)(1) (medical records can serve as informal claim "when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service-connection has previously been established").? Likewise, the mere presence of a disability does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service?connection for that condition.??Crawford v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?33, 35 (1995);?KL v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?205, 208 (1993).

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Although the Board must provide adequate reasons and bases for a decision, the Board need not discuss all evidence of record.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on what the relevant evidence shows, or fails to show, with respect to the Veteran's claims on appeal. Consequently, any evidence not discussed within this decision is irrelevant, duplicative, or unfavorable to the Veteran's claims.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000) (the law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the appellant).

The Veteran appears to seek an effective date of 2018 for increased ratings for his psychiatric disorder.  The Board notes that the disorder has been service-connected ever since April 2, 2018, but in case an earlier effective date for service connection (not just a higher rating) could be warranted, the Board is ignoring all limitations of the Veteran's claims.  Ultimately, while the Board is sympathetic to arguments of record, the Board cannot escape the conclusion that the February 11, 2021 rating decision is final, and the appellate period only begins on March 30, 2022.  This means that the Board is precluded from awarding any benefits, including earlier effective dates of rating increases, prior to that date.

The Veteran first filed his claim for service connection on May 6, 2014.  On November 17, 2015, the Veteran was issued a rating decision denying the claim. See Rating Decision (Nov. 17, 2015).  This rating decision specifically states that following: "Please note: Of record are your Army Reserve treatment records only.  Your service treatment records for your period of active duty are unavailable.  If these service treatment records are made available in the future, we will reconsider your claim." Id. at Page 1.  On February 11, 2021, the Veteran was issued another rating decision, granting the claim for service connection, and assigning a 30 percent initial rating effective April 2, 2018. See Rating Decision (Feb. 11, 2021); VA Form 21-526EZ (rec'd Apr. 2, 2018).  

The Board has no explanation about why the AOJ did not reconsider the claim as if service treatment records could have been available as of November 17, 2015. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).  The Veteran is free to file a motion for revision based on clear and unmistakable error at any time, but the Board cannot assert jurisdiction over this particular AOJ error in the first instance.  See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006) (explaining that 38 U.S.C. § 5109A requires that a request for revision of a final RO decision on the basis of CUE be submitted to the RO for initial adjudication); Hillyard v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 343, 355 (2011).  Any motion for revision of the RO's decision on a basis of CUE would have to be adjudicated by the RO in the first instance. 

Notwithstanding any error in assigning the initial rating or earlier effective date, the claim for service connection was granted in the above mentioned rating decision dated February 11, 2021.  The grant of service connection is a full grant of that benefit sought on appeal, so if the Veteran wanted either an earlier effective date or a higher initial rating, then such a Notice of Disagreement would have had to have been received within one year.  The Board has fully reviewed every piece of paper in the Veteran's claims file in between February 11, 2021 (the date of this initial rating decision) and March 30, 2022 (the date that a claim for a rating increase for this service-connected psychiatric disorder was postmarked by the United States Postal Service), to see if the Veteran continuously prosecuted this claim.  Unfortunately, the Board cannot escape the conclusion that the Veteran did not.  As such, the Board cannot award any benefits prior to March 30, 2022. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.1103.

The Board has seriously considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1), which provides that "Notwithstanding any other section in this part, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section."  However, subsection (c)(3) states that "An award made based all or in part on the records identified by paragraph (c)(1) of this section is effective on the date entitlement arose or the date VA received the previously decided claim, whichever is later, or such other date as may be authorized by the provisions of this part applicable to the previously decided claim."  Service treatment records were clearly received as of the February 11, 2021 rating decision, because that is when service connection was first granted.  In order for the Board to be able to assign benefits effective 2018 or earlier, the Veteran would either have to (a) demonstrate continuous prosecution of this claim within one year of that rating decision, or else (b) identify a service treatment record not of record as of February 11, 2021, but which later became of record, and which should have been associated with the claims file all along.  Neither of these are true in this case.  Accordingly, an earlier effective date is not warranted based on 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c).

There is no competent or credible evidence to suggest that the Veteran ever disagreed with the initial date of service connection of April 2, 2018, nor with its initial 30 percent rating.  Similarly, there is no competent or credible evidence of any new or relevant evidence submitted in pursuit of any earlier effective date.  Finally, even if service treatment records were formerly not of record, they were already of record as of February 11, 2021.  Instead, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran was given an initial rating for the psychiatric disorder in the February 11, 2021 rating decision and took no action on this claim for more than one year.  Only on March 30, 2022 did the Veteran submit a further claim about his major depressive disorder, but this claim is for an increased rating thereafter, without seeking any retroactive benefits.  With no disagreement about any portion of the February 11, 2021 rating decision, it is final.  Other pursuit of special monthly compensation for aid and attendance (an ancillary benefit) is not continuous prosecution of this claim for increased ratings for the psychiatric disorder.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's and his attorney's arguments, but the Board simply cannot escape the conclusion that there is no jurisdiction to adjudicate any benefit earlier than March 30, 2022. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.155(a).  See also Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the plain language of the regulations requires a claimant to have intent to file a claim for VA benefits).  Here, the Veteran was given service connection effective April 2, 2018, in a February 11, 2021 rating decision.  Without offering any opinion as to whether the effective date of April 2, 2018 is correct, the Veteran would have to have filed a Notice of Disagreement about the effective date within one year, or else he would have had to submit a Supplemental Claim within that year to continuously prosecute the claim for an earlier effective date.  He did not do this.  Instead, he only sought higher ratings in the March 2022 submission, and then he only indicated a first disagreement about ratings and effective dates from 2018 in the May 8, 2024 Notice of Disagreement-by which time, the effective date of the original grant of service connection for major depressive disorder was final.  

While being sympathetic to his arguments, the Board cannot identify any lawful basis to accept them.  By statute, the Board is bound by the date that the AOJ received this claim-not when the claim may have otherwise been warranted but not reopened.  Meanwhile, there is no allegation that any service treatment record was still outstanding as of February 11, 2021.  The evidence provides no basis for the board to assert jurisdiction over the propriety of any rating prior to March 30, 2022.  The Board has also seriously considered whether the March 30, 2022 claim was received within one year after evidence of an increase in the severity of the Veteran's psychiatric disability. See Gaston, supra.  There is no such evidence of a factually ascertainable increase, so Gaston, which only provides for effective dates of a rating increase, cannot apply.  Unfortunately, there is simply no basis to make either the 50 percent or 100 percent rating stage for the Veteran's service-connected major depressive disorder effective any earlier than March 30, 2022, let alone up to 2018 as requested in the NOD.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998).    

The law and regulations surrounding the assignment of an effective date for a non-initial increased rating claim for benefits is clear and specific.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The initial service connection award was granted in a February 11, 2021 rating decision, that rating decision became final by not receiving a Notice of Disagreement within one year of it, and there is no allegation or competent evidence to suggest that a NOD was received to vitiate the finality of that rating decision.  If the effective date for service connection is erroneously set at April 2, 2018 due to clear and unmistakable error, the Board cannot adjudicate based upon CUE in the first instance. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The Board can only adjudicate the non-initial claim for increase ratings.  

Within this restriction, the Board is precluded by law from assigning an effective date prior to March 30, 2022, for grants of ratings in excess of 30 percent for the service-connected major depressive disorder.  For this portion of the claim, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against that claim, and, as such, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  The Board will turn its attention to whether increased ratings can be awarded effective March 30, 2022, or else if an earlier effective date prior to February 24, 2023 is warranted for its 100 percent rating.  Subject to the above limitation of the Board's jurisdiction, the Board can grant the Veteran's claim in full, by awarding a 100 percent rating effective March 30, 2022.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran's major depressive disorder is rated 50 percent disabling from March 30, 2022 until prior to February 24, 2023, and then 100 percent thereafter. See Rating Decision (July 19, 2022); VA Form 21-526EZ (rec'd Feb. 24, 2023); Rating Decision (May 5, 2023).  The Board concludes that effective March 30, 2022, but not any earlier than that date, the Veteran has continuously prosecuted this non-initial claim for higher ratings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

While the Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination, where service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is a present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).  The Court has held that, in determining the present level of a disability for any increased evaluation claim, the Board must consider the application of staged ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  In other words, where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings would be necessary.

Consideration is given to the potential application of the various provisions of 38 C.F.R. Parts 3 and 4, whether or not they are raised by the Veteran, as required by Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Generally, separate disability ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not "duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology" of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 262 (1994). The Court has also held that within a particular diagnostic code, a claimant is not entitled to more than one disability rating for a single disability unless the regulation expressly provides otherwise. Cullen v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 74 (2010).

38 C.F.R. § 4.130 delineates a schedule of ratings for all mental disorders other than eating disorders, based upon the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  

As per the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), a 

50 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9434.

A 70 percent rating is assigned for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

When determining the appropriate disability evaluation under the general rating formula, the primary consideration of the Board is a Veteran's symptoms, but it must also make findings as to how those symptoms impact the Veteran's occupational and social impairment. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 116-17 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  A veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under the general rating formula by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration. Id at 117-18.  The symptoms listed are not exhaustive, but rather "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating." Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  In the context of determining whether a higher disability evaluation is warranted, the analysis requires considering "not only the presence of certain symptoms[,] but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas." Vazquez-Claudio, 713 F.3d at 117; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The Board acknowledges that psychiatric examinations frequently include assignment of a global assessment of functioning (GAF) score.  The American Psychiatric Association has released the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Ed.) (DSM-5), and 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 has been revised to refer to the DSM-5.  The DSM-5 does not contain information regarding GAF scores.  Effective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities dealing with mental disorders to remove outdated references to the DSM-IV and replace them with references to the DSM-5.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 45,093, 45,094 (Aug. 4, 2014).  VA adopted as final, without change, the interim final rule and clarified that the provisions of the final rule did not apply to claims that were pending before the Board, this Court, or the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 4, 2014, even if such claims were subsequently remanded to the agency of original jurisdiction.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 14,308 (Mar. 19, 2015).  In Golden v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 221 (2018), the Court held that given that the DSM-5 abandoned the GAF scale, and that VA has formally adopted the DSM-5, the Board errs when it uses GAF scores to assign a psychiatric rating in cases where the DSM-5 applies.  This appeal was certified to the Board in May 2024.  As such, the DSM-5 applies, and the GAF scores will not be considered. 

The Board is mindful of the holding in Bankhead v. Shulkin, and the Board takes note that suicidal ideations are a factor listed at 70 percent in the general rating formula, but not at 50 percent or below. 29 Vet. App. 10, 20 (2017). As Bankhead indicates, it is improper to discount a suicidal ideation due to a lack of an apparent plan to kill oneself.  Though the list of symptoms in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 are not restrictive requirements, in this case, the Veteran's suicidal thoughts are important evidence that his symptoms more closely resemble a 70 percent rating instead of 50 percent or less. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002); 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board cannot identify any evidence of suicidal ideations, but a 100 percent rating throughout the appellate period would ensure that they are not insufficiently compensated.

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran underwent a VA psychiatric examination in April 2022. See C&P Exam (Apr. 19, 2022, rec'd Apr. 20, 2022).  On one hand, the Veteran reported a "good" marriage of 15 years, living with his wife and one of his three adult children at that time. Id. at Page 2, Section II, Question No. 2a.  This would normally be evidence against total social impairment.  The Veteran also appeared to deny suicidal ideations. Id. at Page 3, Question No. 2c.  Nevertheless, the Board cannot ignore evidence that at the same examination,

He reported auditory hallucinations 'for years' where voices 'tell me to hurt myself, sometimes to hurt other people.'  He hears this 2-3 times a week. He reported recently he was walking on a street and he saw this as he was stepping on alligators in water.  He reported also seeing and talking to 'friends that have died' at night.

Id.  The Board notes that in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, "persistent delusions or hallucinations" is a factor contemplated by a 100 percent rating, but there is no lesser frequency (in other words, no mention of "'less than persistent' delusions or hallucinations") contemplated by any lesser rating.  That being said, delusions twice or thrice weekly is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) "persistent."

Thereafter, and still during continuous prosecution of this claim, the Veteran presented before his VA social worker in November 2022. See VA Medical Record (Nov. 21, 2022, rec'd Jan. 4, 2023), at Page 34.  The social worker indicated that even though "Sometimes the person can be left alone for an hour or two[, he] requires intense support when leaving home because of behavioral difficulties (becomes very confused or agitated during outings, engages in inappropriate behavior, becomes aggressive, etc.)." Id.  The examiner also confirmed that due to hallucinations, "Person engages in markedly inappropriate behavior that affects a person's daily functioning and social interactions. Behavior characterized by a radical change in personality and a distorted or diminished sense of reality." Id. (answering "Yes").  The Board cannot reconcile "requires no intervention" with needing intervention "three times per week," id., so the Board will assume that intervention is required against the Veteran's hallucinations.  Meanwhile, the social worker also indicated that the Veteran's underlying anxiety requires daily redirection to guard against sudden agitation and frustration. Id. at Page 35.  Finally, the social worker noted that "When asked his social security number, date of birth, and address, [Caregiver] prompted him initially with the first few numbers." Id.  The Board accepts this as evidence of memory loss of his own vital information, and further suggestive of entitlement to a 100 percent rating.

Finally, the Veteran filed another claim for increase on February 24, 2023, see VA Form 21-526EZ (rec'd Feb. 24, 2023), which is still within one year of March 30, 2022-the beginning of this appellate period on appeal.  There is no dispute that the Veteran receives a 100 percent rating effective February 24, 2023, based upon evidence received from an April 19, 2023 VA examination report. 

The Board acknowledges the listed symptoms in the diagnostic criteria are not exhaustive but serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms or effects that would justify a particular rating. Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 442.  Additionally, the Board has not required the presence of a specified quantity of symptoms to warrant a higher rating for a mental disorder.  However, based on the Veteran's capabilities outlined above, as well as previous outcomes in the Veteran's appeal that are now binding upon the VA, the Board finds that the Veteran has at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) always demonstrated the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, resulting in a 100 percent rating.  To this extent, the Board is agreeing with the Veteran and his attorney's joint contentions that his major depressive disorder was inadequately rated.  As a result, the Board determines that a maximum 100 percent rating throughout the appellate period (namely effective March 30, 2022, but no earlier, for reasons discussed previously) will represent adequate compensation throughout the appellate period. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); AB v. Brown, supra.

The Board has also considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) is appropriate for the Veteran's psychiatric disorder; however, the Board finds his symptomatology was stable throughout the period on appeal. Alternatively, from March 30, 2022 to the present, the Veteran's psychiatric disorder has been stable, and always most closely approximating a 100 percent rating than any other rating.  If there is any doubt as whether to apply the 50 percent, 70 percent, or 100 percent rating, reasonable doubt should be resolved by choosing the higher rating, especially when the 100 percent rating is effective no later than February 24, 2023. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Ultimately, the Veteran brought forth this claim for increased ratings and earlier effective dates, and the Board has seriously considered all claims while maximizing all available benefits.  Subject to limitations caused by only receiving this claim on March 30, 2022, the Board can grant maximum available benefits now.  Therefore, assigning a staged rating for such disability is either not possible, not warranted, or simply not the most advantageous result for this Veteran.  

Finally, neither the Veteran nor his attorney have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the claim adjudicated herein.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for increased rating is GRANTED to the extent of a 100 percent rating throughout the appellate period (beginning March 30, 2022, and no earlier), and the Board concludes that this is a full grant of maximum benefits available to the Veteran.  There is no further doubt to resolve. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran is already in receipt of a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) effective October 17, 2017, which is before and throughout this appellate period. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.  Even if the Board could infer a claim for a TDIU out of this claim for an increased rating, see Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the benefit has already been granted throughout this appellate period.  See Rating Decision (May 28, 2019).  There is accordingly no such claim on appeal now, but if there were, then it would have to be accordingly DISMISSED as moot. 

2. Entitlement to special monthly compensation effective March 30, 2022, but no earlier, at the statutory housebound rate is granted.

In this adjudication, the Board has determined that the Veteran's 100 percent staged rating for major depressive disorder must be effective March 30, 2022.  This is one disability rated totally disabling by itself.  See Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412 (2019).  Separate and apart from this one totally disabling disability, and also effective March 30, 2022 (but not earlier, because the Board lacks jurisdiction of this claim prior to that date), the Veteran has other disabilities independently combining as 60 percent or more. See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1114 et seq.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 et seq.; Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991) (finding that a claim for an increased rating can include entitlement to special monthly compensation as an inferred issue); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (stating that special monthly compensation benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim).

The Board accordingly determines that the claim for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) must be GRANTED effective March 30, 2022, but no earlier.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997); 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Granting the claim at the statutory housebound rate effective this date, 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i), is a maximum grant of the benefit sought on appeal within the limits of current jurisdiction; therefore, this portion of the claim can be adjudicated now without prejudice to the Veteran, see Soyini v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 540, 546 (1991) (remand is unnecessary where it "would result in this Court's unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on the [Board and the Secretary] with no benefit flowing to the veteran.").

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to any higher awards of special monthly compensation effective March 30, 2022 (initially claimed as aid and attendance) is remanded.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The Veteran is being awarded SMC at the statutory housebound rate, 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) effective March 30, 2022 (the entire appellate period).  Also, effective March 30, 2022, the Veteran has an award of SMC at the rate of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k)(1), on account of loss of use of a creative organ.  Meanwhile, SMC at the rate of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l)(1), on account of requiring aid and attendance, was paid from February 19, 2020 to August 31, 2023. See generally Rating Decision (Codesheet) (Jan. 24, 2025).  

By way of background, the Veteran was formerly awarded SMC for aid and attendance effective February 19, 2020.  See Rating Decision (Nov. 9, 2020).  In a February 22, 2021 rating decision, the AOJ claimed that due to clear and unmistakable error in awarding that benefit, it is proposed that that benefit should be severed. See Rating Decision (Feb. 22, 2021).  The Veteran invoked his right to a pre-termination hearing, see VA From 21-0820 (Mar. 18, 2021), and the hearing was conducted on April 18, 2023, see Hearing Tr. (Apr. 18, 2023).  A June 26, 2023 rating decision confirmed the severance effective September 1, 2023, which is the next first day of the month after 60 days. See Rating Decision (June 26, 2023).  In Higher-Level Review, a duty to assist error was identified, see Rating Decision (Aug. 19, 2024), but after subsequent special review of the file, entitlement to aid and attendance was denied. See Rating Decision (Dec. 5, 2024). 

SMC being able to be awarded as part and parcel of a claim for increased ratings, see Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991) (finding that a claim for an increased rating can include entitlement to special monthly compensation as an inferred issue); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008) (stating that special monthly compensation benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim) is a separate claim from the Veteran's petition to restore SMC as improperly severed.  The propriety of the severance will be adjudicated separately in Docket No. 241208-500218, but the Board cannot adjudicate that claim in this decision, due to the separate docket numbers and regulations pertaining to the Appeals Modernization Act.   

A claimant may "limit a claim or appeal to the issue of entitlement to a particular disability rating which is less than the maximum disability rating allowed by law" via "clearly expressed intent to limit the appeal to entitlement to a specific disability rating for the service-connected condition." See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (citing Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 544 (1993)).  The Board has determined that with jurisdiction limited to March 30, 2022 and thereafter (not prior to March 30, 2022), full grants of a 100 percent psychiatric rating and SMC at the statutory housebound rate are each warranted.  The Veteran and his attorney are still prosecuting a claim for entitlement to SMC at the aid and attendance rate, up to and including 38 U.S.C. § 1114(r)(1). See VA Form 10182 (rec'd May 8, 2024).  It is explicitly listed on the Notice of Disagreement, but the Board can only adjudicate SMC as a claim for higher ratings effective March 30, 2022-not SMC as improperly severed on September 1, 2023.

If no further additional benefits are available anymore as a result of the above grants, then the remaining claim on appeal should be dismissed as moot.  However, if there are further additional benefits still available to the Veteran, then any such remainder of this claim must be remanded as inextricably intertwined with the above. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (issues are "inextricably intertwined" when a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" on a Veteran's claim for the second issue).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

If there is any remaining claim for special monthly compensation (SMC) at any other applicable level, then adjudicate it.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1114 et seq.; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 et seq.  The appellate period begins on March 30, 2022, so do not adjudicate any claim prior to this date in any circumstance with respect to this appeal.  

The Veteran is already compensated at the statutory housebound rate effective March 30, 2022, with major depressive disorder being totally disabling by itself, while the Veteran has independent ratings in excess of 60 percent throughout the same timeframe. See generally 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); Youngblood v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 412 (2019).

The Veteran is also already compensated at the (k)(1) rate effective Mach 30, 2022, for loss of use of a creative organ. See 38 U.S.C. § 114(k)(1).
