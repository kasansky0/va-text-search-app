ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted. 

Entitlement to an effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Entitlement to a TDIU was raised as part of a claim for increased rating involving the service-connected right knee disabilities signed on June 21, 2010, but received by VA on June 30, 2010.

2. The Board resolves all reasonable doubt by finding that the Veteran's service-connected right knee disabilities rendered him unable to obtain and maintain gainful employment consistent with his education, training, and work experience for the period of the appeal prior to May 29, 2013.

3. The Veteran met the minimum threshold requirement to be considered for basic eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 as of June 30, 2010.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16.

2. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 3511, 3512, 5107, 5110, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 21.3041, 21.4131(d)(1).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from September 1974 to September 1977. He died in December 2021 and appellant, his biological child, has been substituted as the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5121A.

A June 2020 Board decision adjudicated in the Legacy appeal system granted entitlement to a TDIU. A July 2020 rating decision effectuated the grant of this benefit, and established entitlement to DEA benefits, both effective May 29, 2013. The Veteran appealed the effective dates assigned prior to his death. See September 2020 VA Form 10182. In September 2021, the Board remanded the claims for additional development. A November 2021 rating decision denied the claims for earlier effective dates. In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2013, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU.

VA will grant a total rating for compensation purposes based on unemployability when the evidence shows that the Veteran is precluded from obtaining or maintaining any gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience, by reason of his service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to his age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. Id. In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

The law provides that a total disability rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when the person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 

If a Veteran fails to meet the applicable percentage standards provided in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), an extraschedular rating is for consideration where the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The Board is prohibited from assigning a TDIU on this basis in the first instance without ensuring that the claim is referred to the Director of Compensation Services for consideration of an extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. §4.16(b). Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). That has been done in this case.

Unless otherwise specified, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase is to be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for a TDIU claim is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date for TDIU is the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The effective date for TDIU is governed by the effective date provisions for increased ratings of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU was received on October 11, 2012. See VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. As noted above, entitlement to a TDIU was established in a June 2020 Board decision and effectuated in a July 2020 rating decision effective May 29, 2013, the date entitlement arose based on all the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. 

Prior to May 29, 2013, the Veteran was only service-connected for right knee disabilities, specifically right knee osteochondroma, medial femoral condyle with degenerative arthritis, rated 10 percent disabling from December 16, 1984, to November 13, 1996, and 20 percent disabling from November 14, 1996, to May 29, 2013; right knee osteochondroma, medial femoral condyle with degenerative arthritis and instability, rated 20 percent disabling from May 16, 2000; and right knee tricompartmental osteoarthritis, status post arthroscopic surgeries for meniscal and cartilage repairs, rated 10 percent disabling from January 30, 2012. The Veteran was also service connected for a right knee scar, which was rated as noncompensable as of November 17, 2010. His combined rating was 40 percent.

The issue before the Board is whether an earlier effective date for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU should be granted. Prior to his death, the Veteran asserted that he was prevented from obtaining and retaining substantially gainful employment by his service-connected disabilities since June 21, 2010, the date on which his claim for an increased rating for his right knee disability was received. The Board previously found that the claim of entitlement to a TDIU was raised in conjunction with the June 2010 increased rating claim pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), and remanded the issue to the Director of Compensation Services for an advisory opinion on whether an extraschedular evaluation should be assigned since the Veteran's combined disability rating for the period on appeal dated prior to May 29, 2013, does not meet the schedular requirements. 

Prior to his death, the Veteran asserted that an earlier effective date of June 21, 2010, should be assigned for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU because he was not able to secure and follow substantially gainful employment because of his right knee disability, which prevented him from performing essential functions of even sedentary work (the least physically demanding type of work) including sitting for at least two-thirds of an eight hour day and walking or standing for at least one-third of an eight hour day. See September 2020 statement.

In a January 2020 affidavit, the Veteran focused on the impairment caused by his service-connected right knee disability since he stopped working in April 2010, describing constant pain and flare-ups one to two times a day resulting in considerable difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks and often needing to lay in bed to deal with the pain and relieve the aching. The Veteran also reported trouble sleeping due to right knee pain and described how his right knee disability impacted his ability to lift more than 20 pounds and sit for more than an hour, as well as limitations with walking even with the use of assistive devices. He felt he was unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation since he left his job at Ainsworth Trucking in April 2010, to include work in which his physical demands would be limited. 

The phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" contains both economic and noneconomic components. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019). The economic component refers to an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. Id. The noneconomic component requires a determination as to a veteran's ability to secure and follow such employment. Id. Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Id. 

An award of a TDIU is an individualized determination, specific to a veteran's particular circumstances, e.g., their history, education, skills, and training. See Todd v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 79, 85 (2014). It does not require a showing of 100 percent unemployability. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The ultimate question is whether the veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether they can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The Veteran, who completed two years of high school, was not employed at any time from April 2010 until his death. During a November 2010 VA examination, it was noted that he took early retirement due to his knee condition. A January 2012 private treatment record documents that since he had last been seen the year before, the Veteran had had more mechanical symptoms involving his right knee, was losing motion, and was able to walk less distances. The physician noted that his symptoms had significantly worsened, and it was suspected he was progressing to requiring a total knee arthroplasty. A May 2013 VA examiner provided an opinion that the Veteran's service-connected right knee disability had impacted his ability to procure and maintain employment. Physical limitations included standing for prolonged periods of time, lifting, squatting, sitting for prolonged periods of time, which limited his employability.

In light of the lay statements provided by the Veteran prior to his death and the medical evidence discussed in the preceding paragraph, the Board finds that the Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation was impacted by the mental and physical effects of his service-connected right knee disabilities from June 30, 2010, until a TDIU was granted effective May 29, 2013. The effective date of June 21, 2010, requested by appellant appears to rely on the date on which the claim for increased rating involving the right knee was signed rather the date on which the claim was received, which was clearly noted to be June 30, 2010. See VA Form 21-4138.

While the Board acknowledges that the Director of Compensation Services provided an advisory opinion in November 2021 that the overall evidence fails to support the contention that the Veteran's service-connected conditions precluded employment prior to May 29, 2013, the Board's determination is also based on an April 2020 vocational assessment, which conducted a comprehensive review of the records associated with the Veteran's claim and an interview of the Veteran before concluding that it is more likely than not that the Veteran had been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment, to include sedentary unskilled employment, since at least June 2010 due to his service-connected right knee conditions. 

Given the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the appellant, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected right knee disabilities precluded his ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education, skills, training, and work history, as of June 30, 2010. Accordingly, an effective date of June 30, 2010, is warranted for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis. 

The Board has considered whether entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) is warranted in this case. To establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), the evidence must show that a veteran has a single service-connected disability evaluated as 100 percent disabling and an additional service-connected disability, or disabilities, evaluated as 60 percent or more disabling that is separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or, the veteran has a single service-connected disability evaluated as 100 percent disabling and due solely to service-connected disability or disabilities, the Veteran is permanently and substantially confined to his immediate premises. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The Court has emphasized that a TDIU premised on a single disability may satisfy the requirements for entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Bradley v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 249-250 (2010).

In this case, while the Board's grant of an effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of entitlement to TDIU on an extraschedular basis is premised on a single disability, entitlement to SMC is not warranted because there is no evidence in this case to support a finding that the second criterion under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) have been met. In this vein, the remaining service-connected disability for the period being considered in this appeal is not rated as 60 percent or more disabling and there is no indication that the Veteran was permanently and substantially confined to his immediate premises due solely to service-connected disability or disabilities at any time between June 30, 2010, and May 29, 2013. Since the criteria for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) are not met, entitlement to SMC is not warranted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than May 29, 2013, for the grant of eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a), 21.3021.

Regarding the claim for an effective date prior to May 29, 2013, for the grant of basic eligibility to Chapter 35 educational benefits, the Board finds that pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the Veteran was found to have a permanent total service-connected disability given the Board's assignment of an earlier effective date of June 30, 2010, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis.

In general, effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of Title 38 U.S.C. or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In sum, the Veteran was found to have a permanent total service-connected disability given the Board's grant of entitlement to a TDIU on an extraschedular basis effective June 30, 2010. Therefore, entitlement to basic eligibility for Chapter 35 educational benefits must also be effective June 30, 2010.
