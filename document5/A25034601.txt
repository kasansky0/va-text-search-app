REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1980 to December 1982.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that the Board could not in consider in this decision, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Veteran submitted the claim on appeal using a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. The complete VA Form 21-526EZ includes 'Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits,' which contains explicit notice to the claimant that "You are entitled to a hearing at any time in the claims process. If you wish to have a hearing or have other questions, contact VA online through Ask VA: https://ask.va.gov or call us toll-free at 1-800-827-1000 (TTY:711)." By signing the VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran certified they received the notice attached to their application. Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ issued its initial decision on appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis and diabetes mellitus, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic (reliably diagnosed) in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

VA's duty to assist includes providing a medical examination when is necessary to make a decision on a claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4). Such development is necessary if the information and evidence of record does not contain sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim, but (1) contains competent evidence of diagnosed disability or symptoms of disability, (2) establishes that the veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in service, or has a presumptive disease during the pertinent presumptive period, and (3) indicates that the claimed disability may be associated with the in-service event, injury, or disease, or with another service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 83-86 (2006).

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, every piece of evidence of record. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claim). The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein. See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).

1. Entitlement to service connection for cervicalgia

The Veteran contends that he has a disability manifested by cervicalgia (neck pain) as a result of "military training" and "lifting and carrying heavy objects."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints of cervicalgia or neck pain.

A February 2023 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran reported that he had woken up with right hand numbness after falling the prior Sunday.  CT of the cervical spine showed no acute process of the cervical spine.  The report also noted that there was straightening of the cervical lordosis. Anterior bridging osteophytosis was present at C4-5 and C5-6 with mild endplate and uncovertebral changes at the same levels. The craniocervical junction was satisfactory. No fracture, dislocation, subluxation or blastic or lytic or destructive bony process. No paraspinal mass or fluid collection. C2-3: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. C3-C4: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. C4-C5: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. C5-C6: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. C6-C7: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing. C7-T1: No spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing.

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of neck pain with onset in service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of neck pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his current cervical spine pathology is related to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his cervicalgia. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required.

McLendon provides that in disability compensation (service connection) claims, VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. 

The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that cervicalgia, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The Board acknowledges that the evidence shows degenerative changes in the cervical spine. The evidence does not show that the arthritis was manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation of service; rather, it was first noted by CT in 2023, decades after separation from service. Additionally, the evidence weighs against continuity of symptomatology given that the Veteran reported at the time of his CT in February 2023 that he had recently fallen and now had right hand numbness.  Thus, service connection is not warranted under the provisions pertaining to presumptive service connection for chronic diseases. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. your VA treatment records reflect that you previously underwent a left hip replacement/ total arthroplasty."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a bilateral hip disability as a result of "military training" and "running, marching, jumping in boots."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints of left hip pain or injury.

A January 2022 CT of the abdomen/pelvis noted that the Veteran had undergone total left hip arthroplasty.  VA treatment records indicate that this procedure occurred in approximately 2016.

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of left hip pain with onset in service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of hip pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his current left hip pathology is related to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his left hip disability. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that a left hip disability, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right hip disability

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA treatment records reflect diagnosis of/complaint of chronic right hip pain that results in functional impairment."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a bilateral hip disability as a result of "military training" and "running, marching, jumping in boots."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints of right hip pain or injury.

A February 2019 VA treatment record noted report of right hip pain.  

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of right hip pain with onset in service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of hip pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his current right hip symptoms are related to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his right hip disability. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that a right hip disability, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA treatment records reflect diagnosis of/treatment for right ankle pain that results in functional impairment."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a right ankle disability as a result of "military training" and "running, marching, jumping in boots."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints of right ankle pain or injury.

A February 2023 VA treatment record noted that the Veteran was seen with complaint of chronic intermittent right ankle pain without known injury.  Right ankle x-ray noted mild to moderate multifocal chronic/degenerative changes, without radiographic evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.

A VA examination of the ankles was conducted in conjunction with the Veteran's claim for increased rating for his service-connected left ankle in September 2023.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had subjective/objective complaints of pain/tenderness of the right ankle.

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of right ankle pain with onset in service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of ankle pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his current right ankle pathology is related to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his right ankle disability. In light of the holding in McLendon v.

The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that a right hip disability, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The Board acknowledges that the evidence shows degenerative changes in the right ankle. The evidence does not show that the arthritis was manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation of service; rather, it was first noted by x-ray in 2023, decades after separation from service. Additionally, the evidence weighs against continuity of symptomatology given that the Veteran has not reported onset of right ankle pain in service.  Thus, service connection is not warranted under the provisions pertaining to presumptive service connection for chronic diseases. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA treatment records reflect a diagnosis of right knee osteoarthritis, status post total right knee replacement on July 3, 2023."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a right knee disability as a result of "military training" and "running, marching, jumping in boots."  See June 2023 claim.

Service treatment records do not show any complaints of right knee pain or injury.

A February 2019 VA treatment record noted complaint of right knee pain.  

A VA examination of the knees was conducted in conjunction with the Veteran's claim for increased rating for his service-connected left knee in March 2020.  The examiner noted full range of motion of the right knee.  

VA treatment records noted that the Veteran underwent right knee replacement in July 2023.  

A VA examination of the knees was conducted in conjunction with the Veteran's claim for increased rating for his service-connected left knee in September 2023.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had subjective/objective complaints of pain/tenderness of the right knee.  

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of right knee pain with onset in service. While the Veteran is competent to report having experienced symptoms of knee pain, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case or determine that his current right knee pathology is related to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his right knee disability. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required.

The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that a right hip disability, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The Board acknowledges that the evidence shows degenerative changes in the right knee. The evidence does not show that the arthritis was manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation of service; rather, it was first noted in 2023, decades after separation from service. Additionally, the evidence weighs against continuity of symptomatology given that the Veteran has not reported onset of right knee pain in service.  Thus, service connection is not warranted under the provisions pertaining to presumptive service connection for chronic diseases. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

6. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA treatment records reflect diagnosis of Diabetes mellitus Type II."  

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that his diabetes mellitus is a result of "military diets" and "unscheduled and fixed meals."  See June 2023 claim.

Service treatment records do not show any complaints or findings of diabetes mellitus.

VA treatment records dated back to 2015 note a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II.  An October 2015 treatment record noted the Veteran's report of diabetes mellitus since 1990.   On an October 2021 treatment record, the Veteran reported that he had had diabetes mellitus for 23 years.  A February 2022 treatment record noted that the Veteran had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 25 years earlier.

The Veteran has not claimed that his diabetes mellitus was present in service. The Veteran is not competent to provide an etiology for his diabetes mellitus which was apparently diagnosed years after his separation from service.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his diabetes mellitus. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that diabetes mellitus, first noted several years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The evidence does not show that diabetes mellitus was manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation of service; rather, it was apparently diagnosed no earlier than 1990 and possibly later, several years after separation from service.  Thus, service connection is not warranted under the provisions pertaining to presumptive service connection for chronic diseases. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

7. Entitlement to service connection for neuropathy, left and right lower extremity

8. Entitlement to service connection for neuropathy, left and right upper extremity

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability and his VA treatment records reflect diagnosis of/treatment for neuropathy, left and right lower extremities neuropathy of the left and right upper extremities.

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that his neuropathy of the upper extremities is a result of "military training" and "lifting and carrying heavy objects."  He contends that his lower extremity neuropathy is a result of "military training" and "running, marching, jumping in boots."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints or findings of neuropathy of the upper or lower extremities.

VA treatment records show multiple references to diabetic neuropathy.  The Veteran received a carpal tunnel injection in June 2022 for carpal tunnel syndrome.  

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing symptoms of upper or lower extremity neuropathy with onset in service.  The Veteran is not competent to attribute his neuropathy symptoms to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his neuropathy. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that neuropathy, to include carpal tunnel syndrome, first noted many years post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

To the extent that the Veteran has diabetic neuropathy, the Board notes that consideration of secondary service connection is not warranted since the underlying disability of diabetes mellitus is not service connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310. 

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claims must be denied.

9. Entitlement to service connection for a skin disability

The March 2024 rating decision on appeal contained the following favorable findings: "You have been diagnosed with a disability. Your VA treatment records reflect treatment for/diagnosis of Rosacea."

Favorable findings made by the AOJ are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).

The Veteran contends that he has a skin condition/rash as a result of service.  He specifically asserts that he was "exposed to elements" and "numerous field exercises."  See June 2023 claim.

The service treatment records do not show any complaints or findings of a skin condition or rash.

An October 2015 VA treatment record noted that an assessment of the Veteran's skin showed no wounds, pressure ulcers, or other skin problems.  

A February 2019 treatment record noted rash to the cheeks and the base of the throat.  An August 2019 treatment record noted rosacea.  A red skin rash of the lower extremities was noted in January 2020.

The Veteran has not claimed that he experienced ongoing skin symptoms with onset in service.  The Veteran is not competent to attribute his current skin rash and/or rosacea to an inservice cause.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of pathology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board notes that the VA did not provide the Veteran with a VA skin examination for the purposes of determining the etiology of his claimed skin problems. In light of the holding in McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), the Board finds an examination was not required. The standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the evidence of record fails to suggest that a skin condition, to include rash and rosacea, first noted decades post service, had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim; the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the claim must be denied.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the Veteran's symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. Id. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. "Staged ratings" are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

10. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for left ankle sprain with chronic achilles tendonitis and degenerative arthritis

The Veteran has been rated at 10 percent for his left ankle sprain with chronic achilles tendonitis and degenerative arthritis since December 2018.  His current claim for increase was filed in June 2023, thus the period on appeal begins one year earlier in June 2022.  

Diagnostic Code 5271 provides for a 10 percent rating for moderate limitation of motion of ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion). A maximum 20 percent rating is assigned for marked limitation of motion of ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion).

Normal or full range of motion for the ankle is dorsiflexion (extension) from zero to 20 degrees and plantar flexion from zero to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

A VA examination was conducted in September 2023.  The Veteran reported pain with prolonged standing and pain with prolonged walking.  He reported that his symptoms were constant/daily.  The Veteran used Tylenol (1000 mg) twice daily and ice therapy nightly.  The Veteran stated that he had difficulty showering as he could not stand for longer than five minutes. He could not walk for more than one-fifth mile. He could not climb stairs as it hurt his ankle to travel down the stairs. He could not walk on uneven surfaces and had trouble getting in and out of his car. He reported that he used to do wood and metal working but could not now because he could not get to his garage.  The Veteran denied flare-ups or instability of the ankle.  

On examination, initial range of motion of the left ankle was 30 degrees of plantar flexion and 10 degrees of dorsiflexion.  Pain was noted with plantar flexion.  Passive range of motion was the same as active.  There was pain with weightbearing, active motion, on rest/non-movement, and passive motion.  The pain caused functional loss.  There was tenderness to palpation of the left ankle.  There was no additional loss of function or range of motion after three repetitions.  The examiner estimated that with repeated use, pain would limit range of motion of the left ankle to 25 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of dorsiflexion.  There was no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis of the left ankle.

Upon review, a rating of 20 percent is warranted for the Veteran's left ankle sprain under Diagnostic Code 5271.  To warrant a 20 percent rating, the disability must manifest in marked limited motion of the ankle under Diagnostic Code 5271. In this regard, the September 2023 VA examination report considered all relevant factors, including functional loss.  The examiner estimated that with repeated use over time the Veteran's left ankle dorsiflexion would be limited to 5 degrees.  Diagnostic Code 5271 specifies that marked limitation of motion means dorsiflexion of less than 5 degrees. The Board finds that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating based on his description of functional impairment, and that a 20 percent rating in warranted based on marked limited motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Board notes that the Veteran does not have ankylosis of the ankle to warrant an even higher rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5270.  

Finally, the Board notes that on March 12, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) issued a precedential decision in Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798. The Court held that the holding of Jones (David J.) v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), applies when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities if the relevant Diagnostic Code (DC) does not reference medication use. Thus, to comply with Jones, when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant DC does not reference medication use, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects and evaluate the baseline severity of each disability.

Here, the Veteran reported that he used Tylenol daily for left ankle pain.  However, the Board finds that the liberal 20 percent grant herein adequately contemplates any alleviating aspect of the over-the-counter medication the Veteran uses, and that there is no indication from the Veteran or the evidence of record that suggests his use of such OTC medication is what stands between ankle movement and functional or actual ankylosis. 

11. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for painful scar of left knee, status post total knee replacement

12. Entitlement to a compensable rating for scar, left knee status post total knee replacement

The Veteran seeks higher ratings for his service-connected scar of the left knee, status post total knee replacement.  He is currently service connected for a painful scar of the left knee rated as 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 7804, and for a scar of the left knee rated as noncompensable under Diagnostic Code 7802.  

Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7802 instructed that a superficial scar was one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Id. 

Diagnostic Code 7804 provides disability ratings for scars that are unstable or painful. A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful. A 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. A 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. Note (1) states that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, an additional 10 percent should be added to the evaluation based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Note (3) states that scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this diagnostic code, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic 7804.

A VA examination was conducted in September 2023.  The examiner noted one painful linear midline left knee surgical scar.  The scar was not unstable.  The examiner noted a 19 centimeter by 0.3 centimeter scar of the left knee that was tender to palpation.  The total area of the scar was 5.7 square centimeters.  There was no underlying tissue damage.  No other scars of the left knee were identified.

The Board finds that a compensable evaluation is not warranted under Diagnostic Code 7802. The competent and persuasive VA examination indicated that the measured size of the Veteran's scar was not greater in area than 144 square inches (929 square centimeters). The Veteran's did not otherwise provide a measurement for his scar.

There is also no basis for a higher rating under Diagnostic Code 7804.  An evaluation in excess of 10 percent for painful left knee scar requires that there are three or more painful or unstable scars.  The VA examiner identified only one painful scar.  The Veteran does not have three scars that are unstable or painful to warrant a 20 percent evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7804. 

In addition, the Board has considered other Diagnostic Codes for scars. However, the Veteran's scar is not of the head, face, or neck; deep and non-linear; or associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, and 7801 are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effects. See Diagnostic Code 7805.

In conclusion, the Board finds that a compensable rating under DC 7802 and a rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 7804 are not warranted for the Veteran's left knee scar.
