ORDER

A waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $141.00 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The overpayment at issue was not created due to the Veteran's fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith.

2. The creation of the debt at issue was due solely to delay on the part of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), and was not the fault of the Veteran.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Recovery of the overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the amount of $141.00 would be against equity and good conscience. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5302(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the Unites States Navy from April 1989 to April 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) from an April 2024 decision of the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The Veteran submitted a VA Form 101082, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in May 2024 and elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 COWC decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after April 2024 cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In November 2014, the Veteran was informed that his benefits included an additional amount for his spouse. On May 16, 2023, the AOJ informed the Veteran that it had received information from the Social Security Administration (SSA) indicating the Veteran's spouse had passed away on May 4, 2023. This letter proposed to remove the Veteran's spouse from his award effective June 1, 2023 and informed the Veteran that he had 60 days to provide information before the change in benefits would take place. The letter also informed the Veteran that he could notify VA right away of the information in order to avoid an overpayment. The following day, on May 17, 2023, the Veteran called the AOJ to report the death of his spouse and request that she be removed from his award. The AOJ did not take action to remove the Veteran's spouse from his award. Rather, the AOJ waited the 60 days and took action in July 2023 to remove the Veteran's spouse from his award effective June 1, 2023, which resulted in the $141.00 overpayment at issue.

The VA Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of the overpayment in July 2023 and the Veteran requested a waiver. In January 2024, COWC issued a decision denying the waiver. In this decision, COWC suggested no Financial Status Report (FSR) had been received. The Veteran's representative wrote to the AOJ in January 2024 and resubmitted an FSR that had been submitted in November 2023. COWC reconsidered the waiver request and then issued the decision on appeal in April 2024.

In the decision on appeal, COWC did not find fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith in this case. The Board will not disturb this favorable finding.  

In cases where fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the Veteran's part with respect to the creation of the overpayment at issue has not been demonstrated, and, therefore, waiver is not precluded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a), the Board must determine whether recovery of the indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience, thereby permitting waiver under 38 U.S.C. § 5302(a) and 38 C.F.R. §§ 1.963(a), 1.965(a). In making this determination, consideration is given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) fault of debtor (where actions of the debtors contribute to the creation of the debt); (2) balancing of faults (weighing fault of the debtor vs. the fault of VA); (3) undue hardship (whether collection would deprive the debtor or family of basic necessities); (4) defeat the purpose (whether withholding of benefits or recovery would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended); (5) unjust enrichment (failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the debtor); and (6) changing position to one's detriment (reliance on VA benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right or incurrence of a legal obligation). See 38 C.F.R. § 1.965(a). 

The first and second elements pertain to the fault of the debtor versus the fault of VA. In this case, COWC recognized the Veteran was not at fault in this case. VA is entirely at fault. As discussed above, the Veteran's spouse died on [REDACTED], 2023; VA notified the Veteran it had received this information on May 16, 2023, and the Veteran confirmed this information on May 17, 2023. VA took no action to remove the Veteran's spouse from his award until July 2023. It was entirely VA's delay that was the cause of this overpayment.

In regard to whether failure to collect would cause unjust enrichment to the debtor, the Board notes that the Veteran received benefits to which he was not entitled and as such, keeping these benefits would cause unjust enrichment to the debtor. Likewise, there is no indication that the Veteran's reliance on VA benefits resulted in relinquishment of another valuable right. As to whether recoupment of those benefits would defeat the purpose of the benefit, recoupment of those benefits would not defeat the purpose of the benefit since the Veteran was not entitled to the additional benefits for his spouse after her death. The Board has also considered whether the Veteran would suffer undue financial hardship if forced to repay the debt at issue. The Veteran's FSR gives no suggestion of hardship, as his income is in excess of his expenses by a significant amount according to what he reported. The Board finds that hardship is not a factor in this analysis. 

On the whole the Board finds that, in weighing all of the elements of equity and good conscience, the fact that this debt was caused solely by VA delay outweighs the elements that are not in the Veteran's favor. Accordingly, waiver of recovery of the $141.00 overpayment is warranted. The appeal is granted.
