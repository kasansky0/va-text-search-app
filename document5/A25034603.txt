ORDER

Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), currently rated as 20 percent disabling, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's lumbosacral strain with IVDS is manifested by pain on motion, with functional loss due to pain upon movement, forward flexion is limited to no worse than 60 degrees, and the Veteran does not have ankylosis or its equivalent during flare-ups.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a disability evaluation in excess of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with IVDS have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235 - 5243.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2005 to August 2011.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a December 14, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, in pertinent part, denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for his service-connected lumbosacral strain with IVDS.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on December 18, 2023.  

The Veteran appealed the December 2023 rating decision to the Board by filing a May 21, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On June 5, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Accordingly, under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the December 18, 2023 notice of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.   

The Board interprets the Veteran's selection of the Direct Review option with an indication of a decision being rendered within 365 days as well as statements of record as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim finding that the Veteran does not wish to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024).

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged.  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

In addition, when assessing the severity of a musculoskeletal disability that is rated on the basis of limitation of motion, VA must also consider the extent that the veteran may have additional functional impairment above and beyond the limitation of motion objectively demonstrated, such as during times when his symptoms are most prevalent ("flare-ups") due to the extent of his pain (and painful motion), weakness, premature or excess fatigability, and incoordination.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-7 (1995); see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA must consider whether a higher evaluation is warranted, where the claimant experiences additional functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, to include with repeated use or during flare-ups.  See 38 C.F.R. § § 4.40, 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-7 (1995).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 are to be considered in conjunction with the diagnostic codes predicated on limitation of motion.  See Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7 (1996).  Nevertheless, pain itself does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by the VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  Moreover, functional impairment must be supported by adequate pathology.  Id.: Johnson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 7, 10 (1996) (both citing to 38 C.F.R. § 4.40).

1. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for lumbosacral strain with IVDS, currently rated as 20 percent disabling.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 20 percent disability rating for his service-connected lumbosacral strain with IVDS pursuant to the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.  

Lumbosacral and cervical spine disabilities are rated under the General Rating Formula for Rating Diseases and Injuries of the Spine ("general rating formula").  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235-5242.  Intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) is rated under the General Rating Formula for Rating Diseases and Injuries of the Spine or the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, whichever method results in the higher rating when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.

The Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes provides for ratings from 10 to 60 percent based on the frequency and duration of incapacitating episodes, defined in Note 1 as a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.  The maximum 60 percent schedular rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the previous 12 months.  The Board notes that effective February 7, 2021, the spine regulations were amended to state that Diagnostic Code 5243 governing intervertebral disc syndrome should only be assigned when there is disc herniation with compression and/or irritation of the adjacent nerve root, and that Diagnostic Code 5242 should apply to all other disc diagnoses.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76462 (Nov. 30, 2020) (effective 2/7/2021).  

The Notes following the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provide further guidance in rating diseases or injuries of the spine.  Note 1 provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Note 2 provides that, for VA compensation purposes, the combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation.  The normal combined range of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees and of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees.  Note 4 provides that range of motion measurements are to be rounded to the nearest five degrees.  Note 5 defines unfavorable ankylosis as a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.  Note 6 provides that disability of the thoracolumbar and cervical spine segments are to be rated separately, except when there is unfavorable ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single disability.

According to the general rating formula, a 10 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees, but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent evaluation is to be assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent evaluation is to be assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is to be assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5235 for vertebral fracture or dislocation; 5236 for sacroiliac injury and weakness; 5237 for lumbosacral strain; Diagnostic Code 5238 for spinal stenosis; Diagnostic Code 5239 for spondylolisthesis or segmental instability; Diagnostic Code 5240 for ankylosing spondylitis; Diagnostic Code 5241 for spinal fusion; Diagnostic Code 5242 for degenerative arthritis of the spine; and Diagnostic Code 5243 for intervertebral disc syndrome.

Applying the facts to the criteria set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain with IVDS most closely approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 20 percent disability evaluation under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, for the rating period on appeal.    

In this regard, the Board notes that, at the November 2023 VA examination, the Veteran denied experiencing flare-ups.  The November 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran had forward flexion to 70 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, lateral flexion to 20 degrees bilaterally, and lateral rotation to 20 degrees bilaterally.  The VA examiner noted that Veteran's range of motion upon repetitive use was forward flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, lateral flexion to 10 degrees bilaterally, and lateral rotation to 10 degrees bilaterally; repetitive use over time was estimated as being the same range of motion as repetitive use.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced pain in all planes of motion and that the evidence suggested that the Veteran experienced functional loss due to pain, fatigability, and weakness.  There was no evidence of localized tenderness or pain to palpation, crepitus, muscle atrophy, deformity, or ankylosis.  There was also no evidence of muscle spasm or guarding.  Muscle strength testing was normal.  The November 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not require the use of an assistive device.  VA treatment records dated throughout the rating period on appeal reflect that the Veteran was treated for back pain.  

The lay and medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms do not result in additional functional limitation to a degree that would support a rating in excess of a 20 percent disability rating at any time during the appeal period.  The evidence shows that the Veteran experiences forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine which is better than 30 degrees; flexion to 30 degrees is required for a higher rating based on limitation of motion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5235 - 5242.  

In reaching this determination, the Board acknowledges that VA is required "to discount beneficial medication effects when relevant rating criteria do not specifically contemplate medication use," Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, the Veteran reported that he takes over the counter medication for pain along with a stretching, yoga, a chiropractor, physical therapy and a lidocaine patch. He denied flare-ups. The exact beneficial effects of medication are not known as it is not evident that the Veteran was on medication at the time of the examination. However, the Board finds that the examiner's estimation of the increased limitation of motion due to pain on repetitive use is a valid estimation of the Veteran's limitations due to pain without the benefit of any medication. Thus the Board has considered it in the adjudication of this matter.

With respect to a higher evaluation based on incapacitating episodes under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes, the Veteran's November 2023 VA examination report reflects that the Veteran has IVDS.  However, there is no medical evidence demonstrating that the Veteran experiences incapacitating episodes requiring physician prescribed best rest having a total duration of at least 4 weeks during a 12-month period as contemplated by a higher evaluation.  Review of the Veteran's treatments record also do not reveal any periods of physician prescribed bed rest. 

The Board has considered whether additional functional impairment due to factors such as pain, weakness and fatigability demonstrate additional limitation of motion or function to warrant a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59 and DeLuca at 206-07.  The evidence does not show atrophy or decrease in strength.  To the extent that the Veteran claims that his pain upon motion is the equivalent of limited motion, the Board finds that the Veteran's subjective complaints of pain have been contemplated in the current rating assignment, as the current rating is based on the objectively demonstrated reduced motion and impairment.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011).  See also Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 32 (2017).  Moreover, the available medical findings do not show that painful motion, limitation of motion on repetitive use testing, or pain or limitation of motion on active motion/passive motion/in weight-bearing/nonweight-bearing resulted in functional loss warranting the assignment of any higher evaluation for limitation of motion of the thoracolumbar spine during the entire appeal period.  See Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016).  Nevertheless, to the extent that the Veteran reports that he has pain with prolonged sitting, standing, and walking, as well as difficulty lifting and bending, the Board finds that the Veteran's pain does not more nearly approximate a disability picture with forward flexion of the spine limited to 30 degrees or less not do they demonstrate motion limited to the equivalent of ankylosis.  Thus, additional compensation on this basis is not warranted.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021) (the Court explained that the ankylosis requirement "can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis during a flare.").  Therefore, the lay and medical evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's symptoms do not result in additional functional limitation to a degree that would support a rating in excess of a 20 percent disability rating at any point during the rating period.

With consideration of the provisions of Note (1) of the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, the Veteran was granted service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity and assigned a separate disability evaluation; at the November 2023 VA examination, neurological evaluation of the left lower extremity was normal.  As the Veteran is separately evaluated for his lower extremity neurological deficits, it is not for consideration here.

As the Veteran is does not experience bladder or bowel dysfunction due to his back condition, it is not for consideration here.

As such, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for his service-connected lumbosacral strain with IVDS.  The Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation is denied.
