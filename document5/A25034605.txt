ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for right wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury) is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision which identified duty to assist errors during Higher-Level Review for claims of service connection for left and right wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury) did not constitute a final, appealable decision.

2. The February 3, 2023 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) (VA Form 10182) of a May 2022 rating decision that denied service connection for left and right wrist pain/injury, osteoarthritis, reflects a failure to follow VA's claims processing rules and there is no request or basis for waiver of the relevant claims processing rules.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of an appeal by the Board are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.2501, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1986 to November 1986, September 1987 to January 1990, August 1990 to September 1990, and August 1991 to September 1991. He had additional service with the Air Force Reserve.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2022 rating decision.

In a February 3, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the June 2022 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Dismissal of Appeal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d).

In this case, the AOJ identified duty to assist errors during Higher-Level Review for claims of service connection for left and right wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury) in the June 2022 decision. In response to the June 2022 decision, the Veteran filed the February 2023 VA Form 10182 with the Board, and indicated that he was appealing the June 2022 AOJ decision. However, a duty to assist error advising the Veteran of future action to be taken by the AOJ is not a final appealable decision. See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461-62 (2011) (finding that a deferred decision does not constitute an adjudicative decision for which an NOD may be filed because it is not a final decision). 

The Board acknowledges that the AOJ denied service connection for left and right wrist pain/injury, osteoarthritis, in a May 2022 rating decision, and that this decision was issued within one year prior to VA's receipt of the Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 10182. However, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) later in May 2022 and requested review of the May 2022 decision. The Higher Level Reviewer determined that additional development was necessary and moved the appeal to the Supplemental Claim Lane by way of the June 2022 rating decision. While this administrative review request was still pending, the Veteran submitted the February 3, 2023 VA Form 10182 to the Board.

As a general matter, within one year of the date that the AOJ issues a decision under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) modernized review system, which went into effect on February 19, 2019, a claimant may elect one of three review options: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(1). If a request for review under one of these options is pending final adjudication, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different option without first withdrawing the pending review request. 38 U.S.C. § 5104 (a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b), 20.205.

After a claimant elects one of the three available review options, the claimant may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or appeal to the Board is adjudicated; or the elected request for Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, or appeal to the Board is withdrawn. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c).

Therefore, even if it is assumed that the Veteran's February 2023 VA Form 10182 was submitted in response to the May 2022 rating decision, the Veteran failed to follow the claims processing rules. Specifically, he submitted the May 2022 Higher-Level Review request (VA Form 20-0996), the Higher-Level Reviewer moved the appeal to the Supplemental Claim Lane, and the February 2023 VA Form 10182 was submitted while the Supplemental Claim was still pending. Moreover, the Veteran had not attempted to withdraw his May 2022 VA Form 20-0996. The pending Supplemental Claim was subsequently adjudicated in an August 2023 rating decision, in which the AOJ denied service connection for left and right wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury).

Overall, as to the identification of duty to assist errors during Higher-Level Review for claims of service connection for left and right wrist osteoarthritis (claimed as bilateral wrist pain/injury), the Veteran has not identified a specific determination with which he disagrees that can be appealed. Also, to the extent that the Veteran was intending to appeal the May 2022 rating decision, he has failed to follow the claims processing rules, and there is no evidence or argument for waiver of the relevant claims processing rules. Therefore, pursuant to the applicable statute, the Board will dismiss the appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d); Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (while the Board has jurisdiction to hear an appeal that is not in conformity with the relevant claims processing rules, it may dismiss nonconforming filings in appropriate circumstances if it explains its reasons for doing so); Dunham v. McDonough, No. 23-3014, 2024 U.S. App. Vet Claims LEXIS 418 (Mar. 26, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) ("We have held that the Board can enforce the requirements for an NOD, but that "[i]f it dismisses [a veteran's] claim, the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors") (citing Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 334); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).
