DOCKET NO. 241218-499507
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 20 percent for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the appellant filed the December 2024 notice of disagreement, the VA had not yet adjudicated the appellant's March 2024 supplemental claim. Accordingly, the notice of disagreement in this case was premature, as the issue in question was not yet ripe for adjudication.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to an initial rating for bilateral hearing loss in excess of 20 percent have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1951 to December 1951. The Veteran died in May 2022. See death certificate. The Veteran's surviving spouse has been substituted as the appellant in this case. 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 20 percent for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege a specific error of fact or law in the decision being appealed. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for an increased rating for his bilateral hearing loss in October 2021. The Veteran's 20 percent evaluation was continued in a February 2022 rating decision. 

The Veteran appealed this decision in a February 2022 request for higher-level review. The Veteran's claim was continued in a March 2022 rating decision. 

The Veteran appealed this decision in a March 2022 request for higher-level review. In an April 2022 rating decision, the RO found a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for bilateral hearing loss. 

In a January 2024 rating decision, the RO continued the Veteran's 20 percent evaluation for his bilateral hearing loss for accrued benefits purposes. 

Following the Veteran's death, the substituted appellant appealed the rating decision in a January 2024 notice of disagreement. See VA Form 10182. 

In a February 2024 decision, the Board denied the appellant's claim for an initial disability rating in excess of 20 percent for bilateral hearing loss.

In March 2024, the appellant submitted a supplemental claim appealing the February 2024 Board decision. See March 2024 VA Form 20-0995.

The RO never issued a rating decision addressing the appellant's VA Form 20-0995. Nonetheless, the appellant filed a VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement in December 2024. 

The Board notes that there is no valid rating decision to appeal on that date in reference to bilateral hearing loss. The Board further notes that the appellant has not withdrawn the March 2024 supplemental claim. 

At the time the appellant filed the December 2024 notice of disagreement, the VA had not yet adjudicated the appellant's March 2024 supplemental claim. Accordingly, the notice of disagreement in this case was premature, as the issue in question was not yet ripe for adjudication.

Until the RO issues a rating decision adjudicating the claim set forth in the March 2024 Supplemental Claim and the appellant submits a timely appeal, whether by way of a VA Form 10182 or otherwise, the Board cannot address the claim.

As applicable regulations prohibit concurrent review mechanisms, the Board does not have jurisdiction to address the issue on appeal, and the claim must be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.
