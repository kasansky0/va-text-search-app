ORDER

Restoration of the 30 percent evaluation for left foot cold injury residuals is granted effective March 1, 2023.

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent from December 14, 2021, for left foot cold injury residuals is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle/foot disorder, diagnosed as left foot ganglion cyst, is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a February 2023 rating decision, the Regional Office (RO) reduced the evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected left foot cold injury residuals from 30 percent to 20 percent, effective from March 1, 2023.

2. At the time of the February 2023 rating decision, the 30 percent evaluation had been in effect for less than five years.

3. The evidence at the time of the February 2023 rating decision did not establish that a material improvement in the Veteran's left foot cold injury residuals had actually occurred which resulted in an improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life.

4. Left foot cold injury residuals are manifested by symptoms of arthralgia or other pain, cold sensitivity, locally impaired sensation, and nail abnormalities.

5.  The Veteran's currently diagnosed left foot ganglion cyst was shown to be causally related to events during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for restoration of the 30 percent evaluation for left foot cold injury residuals effective March 1, 2023, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.344, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122 (2024).

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent from December 14, 2021, for left foot cold injury residuals are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a left ankle/foot disorder, diagnosed as left foot ganglion cyst, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5103, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1979 to July 1981.

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of increased rating and service connection claims most recently addressed in an April 2022 rating decision.  In February 2023, the RO issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal.  

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 RO supplemental claim decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board notes that the Veteran was previously represented by a private attorney.  However, in correspondence dated in February 2022 and March 2023, prior to certification of the appeal to the Board, the attorney indicated that his office was no longer representing the Veteran.  The Veteran was notified of the attorney's withdrawal of representation, and the Veteran has not objected to this withdrawal.  In the time since the attorney withdrew, the Veteran has not appointed a new attorney, agent, or representative, and he is unrepresented before the Board in this appeal.

1. Restoration of the 30 percent evaluation for left foot cold injury residuals is granted effective March 1, 2023.

2. Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent from December 14, 2021, for left foot cold injury residuals is denied.

Historically, service connection for left foot cold injury residuals was granted with an evaluation of 10 percent effective September 25, 2000.  The Veteran was later awarded a 20 percent rating effective October 19, 2010, and a 30 percent rating effective December 14, 2021.

In the February 2023 supplemental claim decision, the RO reduced the Veteran's left foot cold injury residuals rating from 30 percent to 20 percent, effective March 1, 2023.  The Veteran contends that the reduction of the 30 percent rating for his service-connected left foot cold injury residuals was improper as well as seeks an increased evaluation.

As the rating action that implemented the rating reduction did not change the Veteran's overall disability rating, a reduction of compensation payments did not occur, and the procedural safeguards of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), such as prior notification proposing a reduction, do not apply.  See VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991); Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board will now consider the propriety of the rating reduction.

In this case, the 30 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected left foot cold injury residuals under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122 was in effect from December 14, 2021, to March 1, 2023.  For a rating in effect for less than five years, a reduction is warranted only where an adequate examination shows actual improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c) (reexaminations disclosing improvement, physical or mental, will warrant reduction in rating).

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of the applicable rating criteria.  Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings that is based as far as practical on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for a loss of working time proportionate to the severity of the disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Significantly, in a rating reduction case, VA has the burden of establishing that the disability has improved.  This is in stark contrast to a case involving a claim for an increased (i.e., higher) rating, in which it is a veteran's responsibility to show that the disability has worsened.  A rating reduction case focuses on the propriety of the reduction and is not the same as an increased rating issue.  See Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991).  In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the RO at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the condition had demonstrated actual improvement.  Cf. Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. at 281-282.

The Veteran's left foot cold injury residuals are evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7122.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for cold injury residuals manifested by arthralgia or other pain, numbness, or cold sensitivity plus one of the following: tissue loss, nail abnormalities, color changes, locally impaired sensation, hyperhidrosis, anhydrosis, X-ray abnormalities (osteoporosis, subarticular punched-out lesions, or osteoarthritis), atrophy or fibrosis of the affected musculature, flexion or extension deformity of distal joints, volar fat pad loss in fingers or toes, avascular necrosis of bone, chronic ulceration, carpal or tarsal tunnel syndrome.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for arthralgia or other pain, numbness, or cold sensitivity plus two or more of the following:  tissue loss, nail abnormalities, color changes, locally impaired sensation, hyperhidrosis, anhydrosis, X-ray abnormalities (osteoporosis, subarticular punched-out lesions, or osteoarthritis), atrophy or fibrosis of the affected musculature, flexion or extension deformity of distal joints, volar fat pad loss in fingers or toes, avascular necrosis of bone, chronic ulceration, carpal or tarsal tunnel syndrome.  Note (1) instructs to separately evaluate amputations of fingers or toes, and complications such as squamous cell carcinoma at the site of a cold injury scar or peripheral neuropathy, under other diagnostic codes.  Separately evaluate other disabilities that have been diagnosed as the residual effects of cold injury, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, muscle atrophy, etc., unless they are used to support an evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7122.  Note (2) instructs to evaluate each affected part (e.g., hand, foot, ear, nose) separately and combine the ratings in accordance with §§ 4.25 and 4.26.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122 (2024).

The Court has stated that both decisions by the RO and by the Board that do not apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, when applicable, are void ab initio (i.e., at their inception).  Lehman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 339 (1991); Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993); see also Hayes v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1996) (where VA reduces the appellant's rating without observing applicable laws and regulations the rating is void ab initio, and the Court will set aside the decision).

After a careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the reduction was improper and that restoration of the 30 percent rating for left foot cold injury residuals is warranted.

In assigning the 30 percent evaluation for left foot cold injury residuals in the April 2022 rating decision, the RO referenced the February 2022 VA cold injury examination report that found left foot cold injury residuals included arthralgia or other pain, cold sensitivity, nail abnormalities, and locally impaired sensation.  Additional February 2022 VA examination reports showed complaints and findings of left hallux nail removal, intermittent symptoms with cold weather, peripheral neuropathy, and sensation changes in the left foot since frostbite in 1980.

In connection with the Veteran's submission of the supplemental claim for an increased rating for his left foot cold injury residuals, the RO provided the Veteran with November and December 2022 VA examinations.  

The Board recognizes that the November and December 2022 VA examination reports reflected that the Veteran had only left foot pain and dystrophic toenails.  The November 2022 VA cold injury examiner noted that foot pain due to cold injury residuals was also complicated by bilateral diabetic peripheral neuropathy and severe vascular disease, which caused recent issues with pulseless left foot and need for angioplasty of left lower leg vascular system in March 2022.  The other conditions mentioned in remarks were noted not to be related to the cold injury residuals of the left foot but were comorbid conditions that caused significant foot and leg pain.  It was noted that additional examinations were completed to discuss residuals.  Per review, the November 2022 VA examiner found the only cold injury residual was dystrophic toenails.  Additional November and December 2022 VA examination reports showed complaints and findings of dystrophic toenails; left foot first digit toenail amputation/resection; current peripheral neuropathy most likely due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy; and peripheral artery disease most likely caused by smoking with claudication pain, femoral stents, and balloon angioplasty.

Based on the results of those examinations, the RO reduced the evaluation to 20 percent effective March 1, 2023, the date the Veteran was last paid.  In so doing, the RO applied the information contained in those examination reports, specifically the November 2022 VA cold injury examination report, to analyze the reduction issue in the same manner as it would analyze an increased rating claim, rather than addressing whether an improvement in the left foot cold injury residuals had actually occurred resulting in an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life.  Here, the Veteran reported similar symptoms in the November and December 2022 VA examination reports to those in the February 2022 VA examination reports.  While current peripheral neuropathy was found to be most likely due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, the Veteran reported he had sensation changes in the left foot since frostbite in 1980.

Based on the foregoing and resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the evidence at the time of the February 2023 supplemental claim decision did not establish that an improvement in the left foot cold injury residuals had actually occurred which resulted in an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life to warrant the reduction from 30 percent to 20 percent.  Accordingly, the reduction is void ab initio under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c) and restoration of the 30 percent rating for left foot cold injury residuals is granted effective March 1, 2023.

Throughout the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's left foot cold injury residuals have been assigned the maximum 30 percent disability rating.  Evidence of record does not show any toe amputations, other related complications, or other disabilities diagnosed as the residual effects of cold injury sufficient to meet the criteria for separate disability ratings during the appeal period.  As such, the criteria for a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for left foot cold injury residuals are not met and the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7122.

The Veteran has not raised any other issues with regard to the issue decided herein, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 368 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle/foot disorder, diagnosed as left foot ganglion cyst, is granted. 

In written statements of record, the Veteran and his spouse have asserted that he has a current left ankle/foot disorder that is causally related to an injury during Air Assault School in active service. 

Generally, service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (2024).  Service connection may also be established for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits.  VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

In view of the totality of the evidence, including the Veteran's documented in-service treatment for left ankle and foot injury in May 1980; current findings of left foot ganglion cyst; and the December 2021 VA examiner's favorable medical opinion that the left foot ganglion cyst was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by the left ankle foot injury during service, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively favors the Veteran.  Thus, service connection for a left ankle/foot disorder, diagnosed as left foot ganglion cyst, is warranted and the claim is granted to that extent.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Finally, the Board acknowledges that service treatment records noted complaints of left ankle injury with some swelling in May 1980 and that the December 2021 VA ankle examination report also listed a diagnosis of left ankle sprain that onset in May 1980.  However, the December 2021 VA examiner clearly opined that the claimed left ankle injury was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the left ankle foot injury during service.  In the cited rationale, the examiner highlighted that the Veteran did have an injury to his left ankle/foot that caused loss of range of motion and pain to the left ankle.  However, the examiner found that the cause of that disability was related to the left foot and not related to the ankle.  It was noted that the Veteran had several other concerns that may cause continued ankle pain (such as gout, neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease) and do not contribute to the left foot ganglion cyst.  Furthermore, the Board notes that the issue of entitlement to service connection for arthritis of both feet is already the subject of another pending appeal.
