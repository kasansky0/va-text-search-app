REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on initial active duty for training in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from May 1983 until his entry-level separation in June 1983.  See June 1983 DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).  Subsequently, the Veteran served on active duty for training from June 1984 until his honorable discharge in September 1984.  See September 1984 DD Form 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).  The Veteran continued to serve in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, with period(s) of inactive duty for training and/or active duty for training until his honorable discharge in February 1989.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  See October 2024 Rating Decision.

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  See February 2025 VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)), Part II.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of compensation is based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Prior to March 24, 2015, when VA amended its rules as to what constitutes a claim, a claim was a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 U.S.C. § 101(30); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).  The date of receipt shall be the date on which a claim, information or evidence was received by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 101(30); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).  Any communication or action, indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris may be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claims must identify the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

Due to the similar dispositions for the above claims on appeal, the Board will address them in a common discussion below.

The Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to February 6, 2023, for a grant of service connection for the above disabilities; however, it is unclear as to the basis of the Veteran's assertion(s). 

The first question for the Board is whether VA received a claim for the above disabilities within 1 year after separation from service.  As will be addressed in greater detail below, the VA did not receive a claim for the above disabilities within 1 year after his separation from service. 

The second question is whether VA received an informal or formal claim for compensation for the above disabilities prior to February 6, 2023, that was not previously adjudicated and final.

The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis on September 30, 2003. See September 2003 VA Form 21-4138 (Statement in Support of Claim) [Informal Claim].  The Veteran also applied for service connection on October 17, 2003.  See VA Form 21-526 (Veteran's Application for Compensation and/or Pension) [Formal Claim].  These claims were denied in the November 2004 rating decision because it did not occur during service nor was caused by service.  See November 2004 rating decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this claim, and it became final in November 2005.  See November 2004 Notification Letter.

The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis on October 9, 2009.  This claim was denied in the September 7, 2010 rating decision because the Veteran did not submit new and material evidence.  See September 2010 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not appeal this claim, and it became final in September 2011.  See September 2010 Notification Letter.

The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis (and complications of Multiple Sclerosis) on February 9, 2017.  See February 2017 VA Form 21-526 (Veteran's Application for Compensation and/or Pension).  However, the Board notes that the Veteran also filed an Intent to File on January 13, 2017.  See January 2017 Notification Letter.  This claim was denied in the April 2017 rating decision because the disability was not incurred in or aggravated by military service.  See April 2017 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not timely appeal this claim, and it became final in April 2018.  See April 2017 Notification Letter.  The Board notes that in September 2020 and May 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement) appealing the April 2017 rating decision, but the April 2017 rating decision was already final.  See September 2020 VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement); see also May 2021 VA Form 21-0958 (Notice of Disagreement).  Furthermore, in October 2020, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) appealing the April 2017 rating decision under the Appeals Modernization Act, but as noted above, the April 2017 rating decision was already final and therefore the appeal was not a valid appeal.

The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis (and complications of Multiple Sclerosis) on May 17, 2021 (form dated April 3, 2021).  See May 2021 VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) [and a duplicate received in June 2021].  This claim was denied in the August 2021 rating decision because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant.  See August 2021 Rating Decision.

The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis (and complications of Multiple Sclerosis) on October 4, 2021.  See October 2021 VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim).  This claim was denied in the October 2021 rating decision because the evidence does not show that the disability was incurred in or aggravated by military service.  See October 2021 Rating Decision.  The Veteran did not further appeal these two Supplemental Claims, and they became final in October 2022.

The Veteran filed an Intent to File on February 6, 2023.  See February 6, 2023 Intent to File Letter.  The Veteran applied for service connection for Multiple Sclerosis (and complications of Multiple Sclerosis) on February 7, 2023.  The AOJ subsequently granted that claim with an effective date of the receipt of his Intent to File by VA, February 6, 2023.

The Board concludes that, although the Veteran had Multiple Sclerosis prior to February 6, 2023, VA did not receive a claim for compensation prior to February 6, 2023, that was not previously adjudicated and final, and that the effective date of the award for compensation based on an original claim is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 

In this case, VA received an original claim of entitlement to service connection for Multiple Sclerosis (and complications of Multiple Sclerosis) on February 7, 2023 with an Intent to file received the day before, on February 6, 2023.  There is no communication prior to l.

Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds no basis upon which to assign an effective date earlier than February 6, 2023, for the grant of service connection.  VA did not receive a claim within 1 year after separation from service and there is no communication prior to February 6, 2023, that was not previously adjudicated and final, that could be reasonably construed as a claim of entitlement to benefits.  VA is not required to anticipate any potential claim for a particular benefit where no intention to raise it was expressed and the mere presence of medical evidence that a Veteran suffers from a disability does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek connection for that disability.  See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998); see also Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009).  Although the Board accepts that the Veteran had the disability prior to the date of receipt of his Intent to File VA compensation in February 2023, the law dictates that the effective date of service connection is the date of the receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Therefore, the effective date for the grant of service connection is appropriately February 6, 2023, for the above claims, and no earlier. 

Accordingly, the claim for an earlier effective date is denied.  There is no doubt to resolve.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).
