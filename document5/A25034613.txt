ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for asthma is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is aggravated by his service-connected sinusitis.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his asthma began during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for asthma have been met.   38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1974 to July 1976.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision.  In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The AMA Direct Review does not allow submission of any additional evidence in support of an appeal.  As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed as of the October 2023 rating decision.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  In general, service connection requires competent and credible evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Similarly, any increase in severity of a non-service-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the non-service-connected disease, will be service-connected.  Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  In the latter instance, the non-service-connected disease or injury is said to have been aggravated by the service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  In cases of aggravation of a veteran's non-service-connected disability by a service-connected disability, the veteran shall be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.322. 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for obstructive sleep apnea which he contends was caused or aggravated by his service-connected sinusitis.  See Statement in Support of Claim (July 10, 2023). 

The August 2023 VA examination and VA outpatient treatment records show the Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.

Although the August 2023 VA examiner initially stated in her medical opinion that the claimed OSA is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected sinusitis and that medical research has not shown a clear link between sleep apnea and sinusitis, she then acknowledged that "[s]inusitis can cause congestion and block nasal airways making breathing difficult[] and this would complicate wearing a cpap and worsen the Veteran's sleep apnea."  See C&P Exam, August 2023. 

Service connection can be granted on a secondary basis both when a service-connected disability is the proximate cause of another disability and when a service-connected disability worsens another disability beyond the natural progression of the disease.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).    

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current OSA is aggravated by his service-connected sinusitis.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to service connection for asthma is granted

The Veteran seeks service connection for asthma, which he contends began during service and which the Veteran has attributed to in-service environmental exposure, including exposure to aircraft exhaust fumes, burn pits, and contaminated ground water.  See Statement in Support of Claim (July 10, 2023); Statement in Support of Claim (August 25, 2021).

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

An October 2020 VA examination and VA outpatient treatment records show the Veteran has a current diagnosis of asthma.  During service, the Veteran was seen in May and June 1975 for complaints of shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and chest pain.  Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service.  On this question there is evidence in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes an October 2020 VA medical opinion, which concluded that the Veteran's asthma was less likely than not incurred in service or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness.  The examiner asserted that there was no chronicity of care either in service or between separation from service and the first post-service evidence of treatment for asthma.  See C&P Exam, October 2020.  

Unfortunately, this medical opinion is inadequate as it relied on the absence of documented diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of asthma in the Veteran's STRs and post-service medical records.  An absence of "chronicity of care" is not a valid basis for a negative medical opinion given that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503 (1992); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Further the examiner dismissed the Veteran's reported in-service symptoms of respiratory problems as "subjective" but offered no reason why she did not find his account credible.  The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to describe observable symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (rejecting the view that competent medical evidence is necessarily required when the determinative issue is medical diagnosis or etiology); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  See also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding a medical examination inadequate where the examiner noted veteran's assertions of in-service back injury during the examination interview but then inexplicably concludes that "it is not likely" that the veteran's back problems were related to service because he found "no evidence of any back injury while in service").

The evidence in favor of the claim includes consistent and credible statements from the Veteran describing an in-service onset of respiratory symptoms, as well as multiple complaints of shortness of breath noted in his service treatment records.

Service connection does not require that a current disability be related to a particular exposure or any other causal agent in service, it only requires that a current disability had its onset in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) ("service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces"); Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) ("Congress has designed and fully intends to maintain a beneficial non-adversarial system of veterans' benefits.  This is particularly true of service-connected disability compensation where the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").  See also Dallas v. McDonough, No. 20-1215, 2021 U.S. App. Claims LEXIS 235, *4 (Feb. 18, 2021) (mem dec., Falvey, J.) (noting that the question for the Board in a direct service connection case is "not whether military service caused the Veteran's disability but 'whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service'"); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's current asthma arose in service.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for asthma is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
