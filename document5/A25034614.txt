ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for ulcers is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.   The probative evidence of record shows the Veteran's currently diagnosed GERD was not manifested during service and is not attributable to an in-service disease, injury, or event.

2.   The probative evidence of record shows the Veteran's currently diagnosed ulcer condition was not manifested during service and is not attributable to an in-service disease, injury, or event.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.   The criteria for service connection for GERD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303.

2.   The criteria for service connection for ulcers have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1992 to October 1996.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued on April 23, 2024.  On April 27, 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, choosing to continue his appeal via Direct Review by a Veterans' Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

The Board is bound by favorable findings made by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In this case, the AOJ determined that the Veteran has current diagnoses of GERD and ulcers. 

Entitlement to service connection for GERD and ulcers 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his or her current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57-58 (1990).

Analysis 

The Veteran contends that his disability is due to military service.

The Veteran has current diagnoses of GERD and ulcers.  As such, element one under Shedden is met.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not document complaints, treatments, or diagnosis of GERD, ulcers, or any stomach condition.  During his December 1991, Report of Medical Examination: Enlistment exam, the Veteran's abdomen and viscera were clinically normal.  The Veteran denied stomach issues.  The separation exam does not appear to be of record.

In January 2023, the Veteran was seen at a private medical facility complaining of a burning sensation in his chest.  The examiner noted a GERD diagnosis.  The issue had been present for five years.  In February, the Veteran underwent an upper endoscopy.  The specialist noted numerous scattered gastric ulcers.   

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for the Veteran's GERD and ulcers is not warranted.  In this case, the Veteran's STRs do not document complaints, treatments, or diagnosis for GERD or ulcers.  Additionally, the Veteran has not submitted medical evidence linking his GERD and ulcers to his military service.  As such, elements two and three under Shedden have not been met.  

The Board has considered the Veteran and his representatives' statements regarding the Veteran's GERD and ulcers.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issue in this case, a nexus between the Veteran's GERD and ulcers is outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).

The Board notes that the Veteran was not afforded a VA examination nor was an opinion obtained for his disabilities; however, an examination is not warranted as the duty to assist has not been triggered.  See McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  Although McClendon sets a low bar, that bar has not been met here as there is no indication of a link between the Veteran's disabilities and active service.  The only evidence of a possible connection between the Veteran's disabilities and his service are the Veteran and his representative's own broad and conclusory statements that the disabilities are related to service, and such statements are not sufficient to trigger VA's obligation to obtain an examination or opinion.  See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that conclusory lay assertion of nexus is insufficient to entitle claimant to provision of VA medical examination).  Additionally, he has not provided any information as to the nature or circumstances surrounding the onset of the disability, nor his history of symptomatology since service.

Therefore, the Board finds that the record persuasively weighs against the claim for service connection for GERD and ulcers.  As such, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
