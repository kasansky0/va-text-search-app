ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, the claim for entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) will be readjudicated.

Entitlement to service connection for GERD, as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left shoulder condition, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An unappealed April 2023 rating decision denied service connection for GERD

2. New evidence added to the record since the April 2023 rating decision tends to prove or disprove an element of the criteria for service connection for GERD.

3. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his GERD is as likely as not proximately related to his service-connected left shoulder condition. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The April 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for GERD, as secondary to a service-connected left shoulder condition, is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

2. Evidence received between the April 2023 and the August 2023 rating decisions is new and relevant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

3. The criteria for service connection for GERD, as secondary to a service-connected left shoulder condition, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the Navy from March 1980 to March 2004.

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for GERD as secondary to the Veteran's left shoulder condition most recently addressed in an April 2023 rating decision. In August 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

New and Relevant Evidence

Generally, a claim that has been denied in an unappealed Board or rating decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. A claimant may request readjudication of a previously denied claim if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). New evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. The term "relevant evidence" means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).

GERD

The August 2023 supplemental claim decision found that new and relevant evidence had not been received. However, the decision went on to adjudicate the merits of the claim. As the AOJ's decision is unclear on the issue of whether new and relevant evidence had been received, the Board will address the issue.  

In the present case, an unappealed April 2023 rating decision denied a claim for service connection for GERD as secondary to the Veteran's shoulder condition. In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a private medical nexus opinion. This document is both new, as it was not previously of record, and relevant, as it tends to prove or disprove an element at issue in the case. As such, the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection for GERD will be readjudicated.

Service Connection

Service connection on a direct basis requires (1) competent and credible evidence confirming the Veteran has the claimed disability or at least has since filing the claim; (2) competent and credible evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or injury; and (3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus or link between the in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).    

Service connection may also be granted on a secondary basis for a disability if it is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either proximately caused by or proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Entitlement to service connection for GERD as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected left shoulder condition.

The Veteran contends that his GERD is secondary to his service-connected left shoulder injury, by way of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat shoulder pain. See August 2024 VA Form 10182.

The August 2023 supplemental claim decision includes a favorable finding of a current diagnosis of GERD. As such, the first element of service connection is met. Thus, the question before the Board is whether the diagnosed GERD is caused by (direct result) or aggravated by (worsened to any degree) by NSAID medications used to treat the Veteran's service-connected shoulder condition. 

Evidence in support of the secondary service connection claim is found in a July 2023 private opinion which addresses the nexus between the Veteran's use of NSAIDs to treat his service-connected shoulder condition, and his GERD diagnosis and symptomatology. See July 2023 private opinion. This private provider evaluated the Veteran's medical record and cited to several pertinent peer-reviewed journal articles, in concluding that it was as likely as not that the Veteran's GERD is secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by his shoulder condition. The Board finds the private opinion to be thorough, well-reasoned and supported by both the record and the medical literature. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). As such, the Board affords it significant probative weight.

The record also includes a November 2022 positive nexus opinion containing extensive argument supporting the finding of a causal relationship between the Veteran's GERD and his use of NSAIDs for his shoulder condition, based on the medical literature and the facts of the Veteran's case. The November 2022 opinion by C.M.B., P.A., evaluates the relevant literature in detail, applying the findings to the specific circumstances of the Veteran's case as determined after review of the entire record. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, at 301 (noting that the probative value of a medical opinion derives from the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion).

Evidence against the claim for service connection includes a December 2022 VA opinion which opines that there is less likely than not a connection between the Veteran's GERD and his shoulder condition. The examiner's rationale is that although the Veteran reported his NSAIDs caused his GERD, the GERD was more likely due to other risk factors, including a history of alcohol use and cigarette smoking. The examiner's opinion is conclusory in its reasoning and fails to consider relevant evidence, to include the long period of sobriety beginning in 1994. See December 2022 VA opinion at 3. The Board finds that the examiner's failure to consider these facts in forming the opinion renders it inadequate. 

Similarly, the May 2022 negative VA nexus opinion concluded that joint and esophageal conditions are unrelated and have different etiologies. This opinion entirely fails to address the Veteran's theory of service connection due to NSAID use and includes no meaningful rationale. The Board also finds the opinion inadequate.

Finally, the record also contains an April 2023 negative nexus opinion on the issue of aggravation. The correct standard of aggravation of a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability is "any increase" in disability, not "beyond natural progression" which is the language on the Disability Benefits Questionnaire containing the negative nexus opinion. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995). Thus, the nexus opinion is legally inadequate.

After review of these opinions, the Board finds that the probative evidence currently of record is persuasively in support of the Veteran's claim. Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for GERD, as secondary to medications taken to treat the Veteran's service-connected shoulder condition, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. To that extent only, the appeal is granted.
