ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for maxillary sinusitis is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis disability was manifested by greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side, or by polyps.

2. The evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's maxillary sinusitis disability was manifested by any incapacitating episodes or by at least 3 non-incapacitating episodes in 12 months.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for maxillary sinusitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from November 1999 to November 2005.

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims for increased ratings, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for OSA, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate Diagnostic Codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Although a disability must be considered in the context of the whole recorded history, including service treatment records, the present level of disability is of primary concern in determining the current rating to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). If a disability has undergone varying and distinct levels of severity throughout the claims period, staged ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.

The October 2022 rating decision granted service connection for rhinitis and for sinusitis, each with a noncompensable (0 percent) rating, effective June 20, 2022. The Veteran's VA Form 10182 indicated disagreement with the disability rating, not the effective date. Accordingly, the Board will consider whether an initial compensable rating is warranted from June 20, 2022.

To that end, because the evidence regarding the Veteran's sinusitis and rhinitis claims is intertwined, the Board will address the relevant evidence in the aggregate, then analyze each claim separately. 

Private treatment records were received in June 2022 and July 2022, pursuant to the Veteran authorizing VA to obtain these records in the June 2022 VA Form 21-4142. However, these records were dated between January 2010 and June 2021; thus, they are dated prior to the period on appeal.

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a statement indicating he experienced frequent sinus infections that had worsened over time since his deployment during active military service.

At the July 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported a history of sinus surgery in 2005 and 2012. The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's in-service duties while deployed, and his current report of runny nose, headaches, and recurrent sinus infection. The Veteran's condition was diagnosed as maxillary sinusitis. He reported experiencing congestion and nasal drainage. He was prescribed Flonase, Allegra, Singulair, and saline. The accompanying July 2022 X-ray report indicated clear paranasal sinuses, and no evidence for sinusitis. The examiner further noted the Veteran's report of no incapacitating or non-incapacitating episodes of sinusitis in the previous 12 months, and no current findings, signs, or symptoms attributable to chronic sinusitis. 

As to rhinitis, there was not a blockage of greater than 50 percent of the entire nasal passage or complete blockage of either side, no polyps, and no permanent hypertrophy of the nasal passages. Imaging was negative for paranasal sinus abnormality, but the examiner remarked that the Veteran had inflamed, erythemic bilateral nasal turbinates. The report stated that his sinus conditions caused fatigue, and affected his ability to perform occupational tasks.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a compensable initial rating for his allergic rhinitis, which is rated under Diagnostic Code 6522. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97. A 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. A maximum 30 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. 

Here, the evidence of record does not contain clinical findings that meet the criteria for a compensable rating. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's complaints of congestion and nasal drainage. However, the July 2022 VA examination report shows that his nasal passages were not found to have a greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passages on both sides or complete obstruction of one side, nasal polyps, or permanent hypertrophy of the nasal passages.

The Board does not wish to minimize the Veteran's symptoms, or how they affect him. However, there are no clinical findings to support the assignment of a 10 percent or higher rating; the Veteran has made no specific contentions or pointed to specific clinical findings that would support such a rating. Accordingly, an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because otherwise the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of higher ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for maxillary sinusitis.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a compensable initial rating for his sinusitis, rated under Diagnostic Code 6513, which is subsumed into the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

Under the General Rating Formula, a non-compensable rating is assigned for sinusitis detected by x-ray only. Id. A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment; or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. Id. A 30 percent rating is assigned for three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment; or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. Id. A maximum 50 percent rating is warranted for such disability following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis; or, near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries. Id. 

An incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513 at Note 1.

Here, the evidence of record does not contain clinical findings that meet the criteria for a compensable rating. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report that his symptoms cause headaches and fatigue. However, the July 2022 VA examination report did not indicate at least three incapacitating episodes or non-incapacitating episodes characterized by headaches, pain and purulent discharge or crusting as required for a compensable rating. Indeed, the examiner did not indicate that the Veteran's sinusitis manifested with either incapacitating or non-incapacitating episodes.

The Board does not wish to minimize the Veteran's experience with his sinusitis symptoms. However, there are no clinical findings to support the assignment of a 10 percent or higher rating; the Veteran has made no specific contentions or pointed to specific clinical findings that would support such an award. Accordingly, an initial compensable rating for maxillary sinusitis is denied.

The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because otherwise the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of higher ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service connection for OSA.

The Veteran contends that his diagnosed OSA is related to his active service, to include as secondary to allergic rhinitis and maxillary sinusitis.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either proximately caused by or proximately aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The October 2022 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a currently diagnosed disability of OSA based on a private 2016 sleep study. Absent clear and unmistakable error, the Board is bound by this determination.

The rating decision found that a nexus could not be established between the Veteran's OSA and his military service, partially because his service treatment records did not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for OSA. However, service records added to the claims file in July 2014 refer to a Sleep Lab report from May 2003, while the Veteran was on active duty. This report is not of record. Because this record existed prior to the October 2022 rating decision, a duty to assist error occurred when the AOJ did not obtain the record for review in consideration of the sleep apnea claim. Remand is necessary to correct this pre-decisional error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain any outstanding records from the Veteran's period of active duty service, to include a May 2003 sleep study or lab report.
