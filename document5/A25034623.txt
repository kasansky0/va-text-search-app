FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The issues pertaining to beneficiary travel benefits for May 16, 2023, May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023 the Veteran seeks to appeal were not adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ); therefore, there is no appeal before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

2. The issue pertaining to beneficiary travel benefits for May 23, 2023 was adjudicated by the AOJ on September 30, 2023, after (and not before) the August 2023 VA Form 10182; therefore, there is no appeal before the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As there is no justiciable case or controversy with respect to the issues pertaining to beneficiary travel benefits for May 16, 2023, May 23, 2023, May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023, the criteria for dismissal of the appeal are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1970 to January 1972, with service in Vietnam.  He earned the Bronze Star Medal, among other citations.

These matters are before the Board from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  On August 17, 2023, VA received a VA Form 10182.  The Veteran did not identify the date of decision(s) he wished to appeal.  He did explain that he was seeking beneficiary travel pay for the dates listed on the first page.  Under the Direct Review option, the Board's review is limited to evidence on record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.  

The Board notes that on August 17, 2023 (with his VA Form 10182), the Veteran submitted multiple VA Forms 10-3542 (claims for reimbursement of travel expenses).  However, those forms are not for consideration under the Direct Review docket.  

As explained further below, there has not been an AOJ decision in six of seven of these matters; in the seventh matter, the AOJ decision postdates receipt of the VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction in the matters.

1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7. Entitlement to beneficiary travel benefits for travel to medical appointments on May 16, 2023, May 23, 2023, May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023 is dismissed.

Legal Criteria, Factual Background, and Analysis

The Veteran seeks payment or reimbursement for the cost of travel expenses to non-VA medical appointments on May 16, 2023, May 23, 2023, May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023.  See August 2023 VA Form 10182.  He did not identify the date of decision(s) he wishes to appeal.   

VHA investigated the Form 10182 form but determined that no decision had been made by VA regarding payment or reimbursement for the cost of travel expenses for the following dates: May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023.  See Missing Documents Memorandum.  VHA noted that a claim had been initiated for the May 16, 2023 date of service but had not been processed.  Id.  Lastly, a September 30, 2023 VHA decision denied reimbursement for travel benefits associated with a May 23, 2023 appointment on the basis that the claim was received more than 30 days from the date travel was completed.

Records from the Beneficiary Travel system show claims for travel reimbursement were received for various dates of service, but not for May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023.  Therefore, the record before the Board does not contain a decision letter or Explanation of Payment for these dates of service, as those documents are only created once a claim is received and processed for a decision.  It appears the claim for travel reimbursement for the May 16, 2023 date of service is pending.  The claim for travel reimbursement for the May 23, 2023 date of service was received on July 8, 2023 and was denied in a September 30, 2023 VHA decision (after the Form 10182 at issue was received).

A VA Form 10182 is a Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. § 20.201.  Although a VA Form 10182 was submitted by the Veteran in August 2023, there has been no claim for benefits or adjudication by the AOJ of entitlement to beneficiary travel benefits for travel on May 16, 2023, May 26, 2023, June 19, 2023, June 22, 2023, June 26, 2023, and June 30, 2023.  Additionally, the August 2023 VA Form 10182 predates the September 2023 VHA decision pertaining to the May 23, 2023 date of service.  As a result, there is no allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration in the present appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  The Board may also dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have jurisdiction.  38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  As there are no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration, the Board has no jurisdiction in the instant matters, and they are dismissed.
