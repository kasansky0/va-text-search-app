ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.      The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder began during active service or within one year of service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

2.      The Veteran's September 19, 2024 Notice of Disagreement seeks to appeal a rating decision regarding hearing loss, for which notification was sent to the Veteran on August 7, 2020.

3.      No good cause has been shown that would permit the Board to extend the one-year filing period for the August 2020 rating decision, and the Board did not waive (implicitly or explicitly) the timeliness of the VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.      The criteria for entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2.      The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1989 to March 1993.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2024 (regarding unspecified anxiety disorder) and August 2020 (regarding hearing loss) rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

Regarding the Veteran's appeal concerning an unspecified anxiety disorder:  The Veteran requested Higher-Level Review for his claim for entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder when submitting a November 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review regarding a decision issued earlier that same month. Then, in January 2023, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ continued the denial of entitlement to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder.  In the September 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran listed the issue of service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder twice, identifying both the February 2024 rating decision currently on appeal, as well as the prior November 2022 rating decision which has been subject to higher-level review.  

Regarding the Veteran's appeal concerning hearing loss:  The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or initiate a Board appeal within one year of the August 2020 rating decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, regarding the Veteran's claim for service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection?? 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during the service - the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).?? 

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?258, 271-72 (2015). Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).?? 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).?? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).? 

1.      Entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder.

The Veteran, through his representative, asserts that he is entitled to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder. Specifically, the Veteran described participating in a combat operation in Iraq and wrote that the mission "goes over in the head repeatedly and will stay with me, I'm sure, for the rest of my life." See March 2023 Statement in Support of Claim.

The Board is bound by previous favorable findings, and the February 2024 rating decision found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with an unspecified anxiety disorder.

However, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder manifested during, within the year following, or as a result of active service. As such, service connection cannot be established on a direct basis.

Military personnel records show the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a mobile subscriber equipment network switching system operator.

The service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of an unspecified anxiety disorder. In fact, the Veteran denied having excessive worry on several occasions during active service, and multiple clinical evaluations showed normal psychiatric findings.

Post-service treatment records are also silent concerning anxiety. Psychiatric findings were described as "O.K." during a general VA exam in 1993, and VA treatment records show no anxiety in September 2013. The record contains no private opinion relating the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder to service.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination to evaluate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in August 2020. During the examination, the Veteran endorsed the following symptoms: anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. The examiner determined that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder and not PTSD. The examiner also opined that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder is at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by an in-service event. Specifically, that the Veteran served in an area with a moderate risk of hazardous noise and that his reported combat exposure meets the criteria for PTSD as fear of hostile military activity. The examiner reasoned that there are no other surrounding stressors that would better account for the Veteran's symptom endorsement.

The Board affords no weight to the examiner's opinion that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder was incurred in or caused by service. In identifying an in-service event, the examiner relied on criteria for PTSD: the Veteran's lay statements regarding a stressor related to fear of hostile military activity. This criteria is not applicable when evaluating service connection for mental health disabilities other than PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). There is no medical evidence to satisfy the second requirement of service connection, an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury. 

A professional researcher from the Veterans Benefits Administration, Office of Field Operations Service, Military Records Research Center, found no evidence to support documentation of the Veteran's reported stressor event.

The Veteran's own statements relating his unspecified anxiety disorder to service are not competent evidence, as he is a layperson and lacks the training to provide an adequate opinion regarding medical etiology. Specifically, the Veteran lacks the training to opine whether an unspecified anxiety disorder, in the absence of credible evidence of continuity, as here, is related to an incident in service. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Also, unspecified anxiety disorder is a disease of the psychiatric system, and the record does not show that the Veteran has training or education in this medical field; therefore, lay evidence of the etiology is not competent nexus evidence as it is not capable of lay observation. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 307-08 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465,469-70. Thus, the Veteran is not competent or qualified, as a layperson, to render an opinion on medical causation. 

Based on the foregoing, there is no evidence that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder manifested in service or to a compensable degree in the first year following his separation from service. The first finding of anxiety occurred in August 2020, over 20 years after separation from service. Consequently, service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder on the basis that such became manifest in service and persisted, or on a presumptive basis (as a chronic disease under 38 U.S.C. § 1112), is not warranted.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder. Therefore, it must be denied.

2.      Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.

In August 2020, the AOJ denied, in relevant part, entitlement to service connection for hearing loss. Notification of the August 2020 rating decision was sent to the Veteran on August 7, 2020. See Notification Letter, August 7, 2020.

On September 19, 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement).

The Veteran's claim falls under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). VA regulations under the AMA require that a properly completed Notice of Disagreement must be received within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the notice of decision being appealed. The date of the mailing of the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).

Here, the Veteran's notification letter for the August 6, 2020 rating decision was dated August 7, 2020. The letter notified the Veteran that if he did not agree with the decision, he had one year from the date of the letter to select a review option and submit the required application. The notification letter provided the Veteran with information regarding the available review options and the respective required application forms. 

The Veteran did not file a supplemental claim, request higher-level review, or initiate a Board appeal within one year of the August 7, 2020 rating decision notification letter. Therefore, the August 2020 rating decision became final. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

The Veteran's September 2024 Notice of Disagreement identified the rating decision issued on August 6, 2020. However, the Notice of Disagreement was received more than one year after the notification of the rating decision and is therefore untimely.

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver that would permit extending the filing period but finds no such evidence. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. at 269; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2021) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Subsequent Appeal). The Veteran did not file a motion for an extension or provided good cause to extend the filing period; no other arguable waiver is applicable here. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 20.203(c) (permitting an extension of the deadline to file a Notice of Disagreement for good cause shown).

The Board has also considered whether it waived any procedural defects by virtue of docketing the AMA appeal. See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (finding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal" for over five years). The Veteran filed his Notice of Disagreement on September 19, 2024. The Board sent a letter on September 30, 2024, acknowledging receipt of the Veteran's VA Form 10182 and placement of the appeal on the Direct Review Docket. The Board finds that this letter acknowledging receipt and the mere administrative act of assigning the attempted appeal a docket, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of procedural defects.

Based on the foregoing, as no good cause has been shown and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made as to the September 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Board finds the September 2024 Notice of Disagreement was, and remains, untimely as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss.

There was no appealable decision within one year prior to the September 2024 Notice of Disagreement related to the issue of entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, so the appeal must be dismissed for failure to comply with the foregoing claims processing rules.
