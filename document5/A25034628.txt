DOCKET NO. 240702-452985
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

An increased rating from noncompensable to 10 percent for allergic rhinitis, effective February 23, 2024, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Throughout the period on appeal, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's allergic rhinitis more closely approximates rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50-percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent rating, but no higher, for allergic rhinitis effective February 23, 2024, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Navy on active duty from May 2002 to September 2013.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As a final preliminary matter, generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows Veterans to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) a Veteran has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§?20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the Veteran or their representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307.  If the Board issues a decision before this timeframe has elapsed - and does not otherwise find that the appellant waived the time to request a docket switch - the Board fails to afford the appellant due process.

In this case less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the June 2024 rating decision on appeal.  However, as the Board is granting the Veteran's claim, it would be nonsensical to hold this decision in abeyance as no prejudice will result from issuance of this decision.

An increased rating from noncompensable to 10 percent for allergic rhinitis, effective February 23, 2024, is granted.

The Veteran contends her noncompensable rating for allergic rhinitis should be increased due to her disabling symptoms.  See February 2024 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

When the Veteran is appealing the initial assignment of a disability rating, the severity of the disability is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  But if the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings, then separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.  This practice is known as "staged" ratings and is employed for initial or established ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  There is no requirement that both medical and competent lay evidence is required to establish a claim; rather, competent lay evidence can be sufficient on its own to establish any element of a claim.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

It is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue, the benefit of the doubt shall be given to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6522 under the criteria found at 38 C.F.R. § 4.97 for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis and is currently rated as noncompensable effective September 18, 2013.  While DC 6522 does not provide for a noncompensable disability evaluation, 38 C.F.R. § 4.31 provides for zero percent evaluations in every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code and the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.

Under DC 6522, a 10 percent rating is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.  A 30 percent evaluation is the maximum rating permitted under DC 6522.

In February 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for an increased rating for her allergic rhinitis and submitted a February 2024 private medical treatment record that documented the Veteran's current allergic rhinitis symptoms.  The Veteran's February 2024 allergic rhinitis symptoms included: congestion, headache, facial pain, pressure, discolored rhinorrhea, sore throat, and coughing.  No polyps were identified that would warrant a 30 percent rating.  See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, February 2024.  The Veteran reported her allergic rhinitis symptoms interfere with her sleeping and breathing because her symptoms include excruciating headaches, facial pain, congestion, pain in eye sockets, pain above eyebrows, throat irritation, and muffled hearing.  See August 2021 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.  Examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran, as the Board must, a 10 percent rating may be warranted because there is no indication that the June 2024 rating decision considered allergic rhinitis symptoms that resulted in congestion or obstruction of her nasal passages and discolored rhinorrhea.  Moreover, the June 2024 rating decision failed to account for any ameliorative effects of medication.

Therefore, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's increased rating claim for allergic rhinitis from noncompensable to 10 percent, is warranted.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's increased rating claim from noncompensable to 10 percent for allergic rhinitis, effective February 23, 2024, is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
