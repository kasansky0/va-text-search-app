ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for persistent depressive disorder, secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2, on a causation basis, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to May 11, 2020, for the award of service connection for bilateral eye diabetic retinopathy with ocular hypertension, dry eye syndrome and cataracts ("bilateral eye disability") is denied.

From May 11, 2020, a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder was caused by the Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus type 2.

2. On May 11, 2020, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File a claim for compensation after entitlement to compensation for bilateral diabetic retinopathy arose in VAMC records of 2014 and November 9, 2017.  A formal claim for this benefit was received within a year of the intent to file.

3. From May 11, 2020, the Veteran's bilateral eye disability has manifested as corrected vision of 20/40 in each eye, without reduction in visual field, diplopia, or any evidence of incapacitating episodes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for persistent depressive disorder, secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2, on a causation basis, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to May 11, 2020, for the award of service connection for a bilateral eye disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400.

3. From May 11, 2020, the criteria for a compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.27, 4.79, Diagnostic Code 6040-6066.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Navy from February 1969 to February 1973.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of a March 2021 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  As is pertinent to the instant appeal in the rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for persistent depressive disorder and granted service connection for a bilateral eye disability, assigning a noncompensable rating effective from May 11, 2020, the date of an Intent to File.

In his August 2021, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Evidence docket.  With specificity the Veteran appealed the three issues as captioned above.  The Veteran's representative requested an additional 90-day extension, which the Board implicitly granted.

The Veteran timely appealed the effective date assigned when service connection was granted for the bilateral eye disability, so there is no issue as to a freestanding earlier effective date.  Cf. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (VA claimants may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date in an attempt to overcome the finality of an unappealed VA decision); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, n. 4 (2024) ("Whether Rudd and Leonard apply in the AMA system when a supplemental claim is filed more than 1 year after the last prior adjudication, which the Secretary asserts is analogous to a legacy system claim to reopen, Secretary's Supplemental Br. at 2, is beyond the scope of this decision").  

Under the AMA Evidence docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative within 90 days of receipt of the VA Form 10182.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time, file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

As a last introductory note, the Veteran's representative referenced entitlement to a total disability rating based upon unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) in the application for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral eye disability.  As of the rendering of the decision on appeal, the Veteran has not been granted a TDIU, nor has the Veteran had the Veteran filed a formal application for this benefit.  The issue of entitlement to a TDIU may be part of a service connection claim, particularly when service connection has been granted and the initial rating timely appealed.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 396 (2024) ("TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability") (emphasis added); See also Garcia v. McDonough, No. 23-6158, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1257 (Aug. 13, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) ("in Phillips, we doubled down on the central holding of Rice: TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability) (emphasis added); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  Moreover, the Board must consider whether entitlement to a TDIU was raised from the effective date of the grant of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  See Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356, 361-62 (2018) (the Veteran's notice of disagreement with the initial rating assigned in connection with the grant of service connection, combined with evidence of unemployability, resulted in the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from the effective date of the grant of service connection being on appeal).

For the following reasons, the Board finds that TDIU was not raised as part and parcel of the claim for an increased initial rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  While the February 2021 VA eye conditions examination disclosed that the Veteran's bilateral eye disability did functionally impact his ability to work to the extent that the Veteran experiences burning, redness and irritation of his eyes on a weekly to daily basis and reading, driving, and computer operation present challenges, neither the Veteran nor the clinician reported or intimated that this disability precluded gainful employment in light of the Veteran's professional experience and educational attainment.  Therefore, despite its inclusion in the VA Form 526EZ, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU was not raised as part of the Veteran's claim for service connection for his bilateral eye disability or his timely challenge to the initial rating assigned after service connection was granted. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection is also warranted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F. 4th 1360, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2023) ("but for" causation "applies to the natural progression of a condition not caused by a service-connected injury or disease, but that nonetheless would have been less severe were it not for the service-connected disability. Stated another way... compensation [is warranted] for a worsening of functionality-whether through an inability to treat or a more direct, etiological cause").  The Court has also held that the "'causation requirement in the phrase 'the result of' is 'broad,' in that it permits entitlement to VA benefits 'based on a multi-link causal chain.'"  Payne v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 373, 384 (2019).  See also Spicer, 61 F. 4th at 1364 ("The but-for causation standard is not limited to a single cause and effect, but rather contemplates multi-causal links, including action and inaction"). 

Persistent depressive disorder, secondary to diabetes mellitus type 2

In a November 2020 VA mental disorders examination report, a VA psychologist rendered a DSM-5 diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress.  Therefore, the current disability requirement has been met.  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 404 (2020), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F. 4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (a valid DSM-5 diagnosis is required to warrant compensation for a psychiatric disability); Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 139, 140 (1997) (mental health professionals "are presumed to know the DSM requirements applicable to their practice and to have taken them into account in providing" a psychiatric diagnosis).  

The Veteran is competent to report that the discernable symptoms of his depression and anxiety surfaced with the deterioration of his health, particularly with the functional impact of his service-connected diabetes mellitus type 2 upon his activities of everyday life.  Not only has the Veteran conveyed this, but his sister submitted a lay statement during the period under consideration wrote that she has personally observed the Veteran's agitation, anger, irrational behavior, and boisterousness when his diabetes mellitus type 2 "sugar levels" are high.  When the levels are low, according to this lay informant, the Veteran becomes disoriented, confused, and despondent.  Indeed, the Veteran and his sister have offered highly probative accounts concerning the "connexity" between service-connected diabetes mellitus type 2 and discernable mental health symptom.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (a veteran is competent to testify regarding observations); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1337 (holding lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).  The Veteran's accounts moreover are plausible, internally consistent, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of service, and there is nothing of equal or greater probative weight in the evidence of record to contradict this account of his discernable and ongoing symptoms culminating in the above noted diagnoses.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a) (each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks service connection must be considered based on factors including the basis of places, types, and circumstances of service as shown by service records).  

In May 2021, VA received an extensive private medical report from Dr C, who holds accreditation from the American Board of Psychiatry and the American Board of Internal medical.  This private medical report entered the record during a period of time that the Board cannot consider in this Evidence docket case, as explained.  Thus, under the AMA Dr. C's report would not be evidence considered; however, the Board finds that an exception is warranted here.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 330 (2021) ("while the Board has jurisdiction to hear an appeal that is not in conformity with the relevant claims processing rules, it may dismiss nonconforming filings in appropriate circumstances if it explains its reasons for doing so); see also Dunham v. McDonough, No. 23-3014, 2024 U.S. App. Vet Claims LEXIS 418 (Mar. 26, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) ("We have held that the Board can enforce the requirements for an NOD, but that "[i]f it dismisses [a veteran's] claim, the Board should identify the governing law, any formal defects in the appeal, whether waiver or forfeiture is a relevant consideration, and any other relevant factors") (citing Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 334); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  The Board finds that the extenuating circumstances surrounding the severity of the Veteran's overall health and the delay that this severity posed for conducting a fulsome interview (at the heart of Dr. C's report) serve as a basis for waiving the claims processing rule violation as to the consideration of Dr. C's untimely medical report received on May 10, 2021.  Cf. Bolds v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 359, 365-66 (2024) ("section 7113(b)'s and § 20.302(a)'s evidence submission limits are claims-processing rules subject to Secretarial waiver").

Turning to the report, Dr. C provided an extensive review of the evidence of record; carefully considered the Veteran's lay accounts; reference multiple peer-reviewed publications to support his opinions; and conducted a personal interview (allowing assessment of all non-verbal cues, mannerisms and manifestation expressed by the Veteran).  Upon consideration of the totality of evidence, Dr. C reasoned that the "nidus" of the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress is diabetes mellitus 2 and its symptomatology.  With the progression of this disease entity and its treatment, according to Dr. C, the Veteran developed depression and anxiety that persists to the present day.  As a rationale to support this theory of multi-link causation between service-connected diabetes mellitus and diagnosed persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress, Dr, C pointed to a peer-reviewed article that highlights the causative relationship between chronic disease and mental health disabilities.  As Dr. C wrote:

The combination of diabetes [mellitus type 2] and [the Veteran's mental health disability] creates a clinical scenario where both disease processes potentiate each other, causing an intractable situation, given the nexus.

Thus Dr. C rendered a positive etiological opinion based upon secondary causation, underscoring the multiple link chain between diabetes mellitus type 2 and persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress.  Especially when considered in tandem with the Veteran's and his sister's competent lay accounts, the Board finds that Dr. C's positive etiological opinion as to secondary causation warrants substantial probative weight.  Dr. C approached these disabilities holistically, through consideration of all of the extant evidence of record, conducted a fulsome interview, and referred to peer-reviewed literature to support his conclusion as to the etiology of the Veteran's persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).

The November 2020 VA psychological rendered a negative etiological opinion.  As a rationale, the psychologist indicated that the Veteran's "depression" started with the death of his son and nephew, as gleaned from the evaluation.  According to the psychologist, the Veteran did not mention diabetes mellitus being a "contributing factor".  This however is contradictory to a finding that this psychologist made in the examination reported to the effect that diabetes (among other disease entities) is a medical diagnosis that is "relevant to the understanding or management of the Veteran's mental health disorder".  This contradicts the statement that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type 2 was not, at minimum, a contributing factor to the acquisition of persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress.  The Board finds that this psychologist's negative etiological opinion therefore warrants diminished probative weight.  Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 

Considering the above, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's service-connected diabetes mellitus type caused his persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress in a multi-link chain.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence of record must be resolved in the Veteran's favor, entitlement to service connection for persistent depressive disorder with anxious distress is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or the other is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran and his representative contend that Veteran warrants an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his bilateral eye disability because "he is entitled to service connection for any complications resulting from diabetes mellitus type 2 as of the date the complication appeared in the Veteran's claim[s] file or VAMC records".  Also, the parties noted that since the Veteran served in Vietnam, he is entitled to the special effective date given to [...] Veterans".

Generally, the effective date for a grant of service connection on an original claim is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Effective March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660-01 (2015). In their place, VA recognizes "an intent to file a claim," which may be submitted electronically, on a prescribed intent-to-file-a-claim form, or through an oral communication to certain VA employees that is later recorded in writing. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(b)(1)(i)-(iii) (2018).  If VA receives a complete application form as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) within one year of receipt of an intent to file, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

In correspondence of May 11, 2020, VA indicated that the Veteran's "intent to file" was received on May 11, 2020.  On November 2, 2020, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 526EZ, which listed his bilateral eyes disability and TDIU.

As to the issue of when the benefit arose, in a November 27, 2013, VA eye diabetic imaging consultation report, a VA optometrist indicated that diagnostic imaging of the Veteran's bilateral eyes did not disclose diabetic retinopathy, macular abnormalities, or optic nerve abnormalities.  As of 2014, VA treatment records and progress notes disclose ocular hypertension and dry eyes.  Thus, as to these features of the bilateral eye disability, the benefit arose "in VAMC records" as of 2014.  As to diabetic retinopathy, the earliest VA medical evidence of record dates from November 9, 2017.  Consequently, as to this feature of the Veteran's bilateral eye disability, entitlement to the benefit arose in VAMC records as of November 9, 2017.  As the date of claim, May 11, 2020 (the date of an intent to file followed within a year by a complete application), is later than the date entitlement arose, this is the proper effective date.

Turning to the contention as to "special effective dates" for Veteran's who served in Vietnam, a "Nehmer class member" means either a Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease or a surviving spouse, child, or parent of a deceased Vietnam veteran who died from a covered herbicide disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (b)(1).  A "covered herbicide disease" means a disease for which VA has established a presumption of service connection as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (b)(2).  While diabetes mellitus type 2 is a covered herbicide disease, diabetic retinopathy is not a covered disease.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

Moreover, in Ellington v. Peake, the Federal Circuit commented that "a requirement that a secondary condition 'be considered a part of [an] original condition' does not, in our view, establish that the original condition and the secondary condition must receive identical effective dates."  541 F. 3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  The Federal Circuit elaborated that "a per se rule requiring identical effective dates for primary and secondary conditions would be illogical, given that secondary conditions may not arise until years after the onset of the original condition."  Id.  The Federal Circuit concluded that that "the effective date for secondary conditions is governed by [38 C.F.R. § ] 3.400, which establishes the effective date as the 'date of receipt of claim, or [the] date entitlement arose, whichever is later.'"  Id.  § 3.310(a) "is concerned only with entitlement to service connection and is silent with respect to the proper effective date for service connection." Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  A claim for service connection for a primary disability does not necessarily encompass a claim for secondary service connection, Manzanares v. Shulkin, 863 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and such claims are distinct for effective date purposes, Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-71 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Thus, any argument as to any special provisions concerning Veterans who service in Vietnam do not extend to secondary disabilities, as is the case with diabetic retinopathy.

As the benefit (be it 2014 or November 9, 2017) arose before VA received the Veteran's intent to file on May 11, 2020, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether an earlier effective date is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against an effective date earlier than May 11, 2020, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application in this regard.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 781-82.

Higher Initial Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  

Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007).  Here, as explained below, the uniform ratings are proper.

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

As noted above, the AOJ awarded service connection for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability in the March 2021 rating decision at a noncompensable rating effective from May 11, 2020.  The Veteran's disability has been rated under Diagnostic Code 6040-6066.  Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the specific basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown as a hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  Diagnostic Code 6006 refers to retinopathy and Diagnostic Code 6066 reflects that a Veteran is rated for loss of visual acuity.

The General Rating Formal for Diseases of the Eye instructs to evaluate based on either visual impairment due to a particular condition or on incapacitating episodes, whichever results in a higher evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79

The evaluation of visual impairment is based on impairment of visual acuity (excluding developmental errors of refraction), visual field, and muscle function.  38 C.F.R. § 4.75(a).  To determine the evaluation for visual impairment when both decreased visual acuity and visual field defect are present in one or both eyes and are service connected, visual acuity and visual field defects are evaluated separately, and then combined under the provisions of § 4.25.

Diagnostic Code 6066 provides ratings where vision in one eye (the poorer eye) is 10/200 or better.  Where the visual acuity in both eyes is 20/40, a 0 percent rating is warranted.  Where the visual acuity in the poorer eye is 20/50, a 10 percent rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is either 20/50 or 20/40. Where the visual acuity in one the poorer eye is 20/70, the following ratings apply. A 30 percent rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is also 20/70.  A 20 percent rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/50. A 10 percent rating is warranted where vision in the other eye is 20/40.

Evaluation of visual field is based on the remaining field of vision in each eye. Under Diagnostic Code 6080, a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 16 to 60 degrees; bilateral contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 46 to 60 degrees; or the unilateral loss of the temporal half, nasal half, inferior half, or superior half of visual field.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for unilateral concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 6 to 15 degrees.  A 30 percent is warranted for unilateral concentric contraction of the visual field with remaining visual field of 5 degrees; or bilateral contraction of the visual field with remaining field of 31 to 45 degrees.

Diabetic retinopathy rated under Diagnostic Code 6040 is to be evaluated pursuant to the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Eye.  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.  Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 1 but less than 3 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted.  Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 3 but less than 5 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted.  Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring at least 5 but less than 7 treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. Where there are documented incapacitating episodes requiring 7 or more treatment visits for an eye condition during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted. Note (1) indicates that, for the purposes of evaluations under 38 C.F.R. § 4.79, an incapacitating episode is an eye condition severe enough to require a clinic visit to a provider specifically for treatment purposes. Note (2) indicates that examples of treatment may include but are not limited to: systemic immunosuppressants or biologic agents; intravitreal or periocular injections; laser treatments; or other surgical interventions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

The Veteran reported for a VA eye conditions examination in February 2021.  The clinician rendered diagnoses of bilateral ocular hypertension, bilateral dry eye syndrome, bilateral nuclear sclerosis and non-proliferative bilateral diabetic retinopathy.  The clinician reported that the Veteran's cataracts were preoperative.  Corrected visual acuity was 20/40 in both eyes.  There was no diplopia.  The clinician did not have a documented visual field defect.  The clinician opined that the Veteran's visual acuity is reduced as a result of bilateral cataracts.  There was no aphakia or dislocation of the crystalline lens. There was no scarring or disfigurement, or incapacitating episodes attributable to an eye condition.  As to this disability's functional impact on the Veteran's ability to work, the clinician wrote:

The Veteran experiences burning, redness and irritation of his eyes on a weekly to daily basis.  This makes reading driving and computer difficult.  He is not able to sustain these activities for prolonged periods.  The veteran also experiences glare from surrounding lights when driving and finds it impossible to drive at night.  The combination of post cataract status, diabetes, and dry eye all contribute to these symptoms.

Applying the relevant rating criteria to the above findings, the Veteran's bilateral eye disability symptoms do not more nearly approximate a compensable rating.  At worst, the Veteran's corrected bilateral visual acuity was 20/40, which falls squarely within that contemplated by a noncompensable rating.  There was no documented visual field defect, no diplopia, and no evidence of incapacitating episodes under the rating criteria in effect during that period. 

A compensable rating would require more severe visual impairment than that demonstrated during the period, or evidence of incapacitating episodes. 

To the extent the Veteran asserts that his bilateral eye disability warrants a higher initial rating, the Veteran is competent to describe the observable and discernable symptoms of his service-connected disability. Jandreau, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377.   However, he is not competent to assess whether his bilateral eye disability warrants a higher initial rating under the applicable, highly specialized ophthalmological criteria.

Considering the above, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's bilateral eye disability warrants an initial compensable rating.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against assigning an initial compensable rating for the Veteran's bilateral eye disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application.  Lynch, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82.
