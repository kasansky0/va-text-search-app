DOCKET NO. 230605-352030
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of November 6, 2014, but no earlier, for the grant of a 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

From November 6, 2014, the Veteran's hypertension more closely approximated hypertension requiring continuous medication for control with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly exceeding 100 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of November 6, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of an increased 10 percent rating for hypertension are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.157, 3.400, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 2010 to March 2011, June 2012, and March 2013 to June 2013.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). The Veteran timely appealed, submitting a VA Form 10182 the next month and selecting the Direct Review docket. In the Direct Review docket, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision on appeal for each issue. Accordingly, no additional evidence after the May 2023 rating decision may be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board recognizes that there is an outstanding Privacy Act request related to an entirely different matter and not the Veteran's hypertension claim, but as the Board is able to fully grant her limited increased rating claim, she is not prejudiced in this regard.

Effective Date

Generally, an effective date of benefits is assigned from the later of the date of claim or the date that the entitlement to the benefit arose. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Entitlement to an effective date of November 6, 2014, but no earlier, for the grant of a 10 percent disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected hypertension, is granted.

The Veteran asserts that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for her increased 10 percent rating for hypertension. See June 2023 VA Form 10182. The Board agrees.

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial noncompensable rating prior to May 12, 2023, and a 10 percent rating thereafter.

Hypertension is rated under DC 7101. A 10 percent rating is warranted for hypertension manifested by diastolic pressure of predominately 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominately 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 requiring continuous medication for control. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101.

In reviewing the file, particularly her VA treatment records, the record demonstrates that the Veteran's hypertension is currently manifested by diastolic pressure predominately over 100. See June 2017, July 2017, January 2018, March 2018, October 2018, December 2018, September 2019, February 2020, March 2020, March 2021, June 2022, and August 2022 VA treatment records. Moreover, the Veteran has required continuous medication for control of her hypertension throughout the appeal. To that end, the April 2022 VA examiner notes that the Veteran has been on prescription medications for her hypertension since 2017 and the Board does not appear to be in possession of any post-service VA treatment records prior to that date; however, there is a medication flowsheet printed in May 2013 that notes a prescription for blood pressure medication. Therefore, in affording the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran the Board finds that the Veteran has been on hypertension medications since at least November 2014. Based on the above, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt as to the date of onset of compensable symptoms in the Veteran's favor and finds that an increased 10 percent rating is warranted from November 6, 2014, the date of her initial claim.
