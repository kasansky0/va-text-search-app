DOCKET NO. 230901-375018
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

For accrued benefits purposes only, entitlement to an initial evaluation higher than 40 percent for lumbar radiculopathy with foot drop, left lower extremity (LLE), is denied.

For accrued purposes only, entitlement to additional special monthly compensation (SMC) at the next higher statutory rate is denied.

For accrued purposes only, entitlement to a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability is denied.

(The Board infers jurisdiction of the TDIU issue based on assertions in the record. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009).).

The issue of entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for a herniated disc, lumbar spine, for accrued benefits purposes is in a different appeal stream, and it will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively shows that the Veteran has received the maximum allowable rating for the LLE radiculopathy.

2. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran was not blind in either eye prior to his death.

3. The evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a reasonable possibility that the Veteran's disabilities for which he received VA compensation precluded him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating higher than 40 percent for LLE lumbar radiculopathy for accrued benefits purposes only, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8521. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC at the next higher statutory rate for accrued benefits purposes only, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114, 1151(a), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 4.1. 

3. The criteria for entitlement to referral for consideration of a TDIU on an extraschedular basis have not been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(b). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran's claim for compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 was pending at the time of his death. The appellant is his surviving spouse, and she was duly substituted in his stead. Through counsel, she appealed an April 2023 rating decision on Higher-Level Review (HLR) via the Evidence Submission Lane, and the appeal was duly docketed at the Board. See April 2023 Rating Decision Narrative; September 2023 VA Form 10182; September 2023 BVA Docketing Letter.

The April 2023 rating decision decided two issues: 1. For accrued purposes only, evaluation of radiculopathy with foot drop, left lower extremity, which is currently 30 percent disabling, is increased to 40 percent effective September 16, 2013.; and, 2. For accrued purposes only, entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of one foot is granted from September 16, 2013.

Evidentiary Record

The Board decision below is based on the evidence of record as of the date the April 2023 rating decision was issued, and any additional evidence submitted with the appellant's NOD or within 90 days following receipt of the NOD. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. The Board has not considered any evidence other than that noted.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision below. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, she may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Higher Ratings

1. For accrued purposes only, entitlement to an initial evaluation higher than 40 percent for LLE lumbar radiculopathy with foot drop is denied.

Initially, upon granting the Veteran's claim for compensation under 38 C.F.R. § 1151, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted a 30 percent rating. See November 2022 Rating Decision Narrative. The appellant, through counsel, applied for a HLR review, and on HLR, the AOJ increased the rating from 30 percent to 40 percent. See April 2023 Rating Decision Narrative.

Based on the medical evidence of record, the AOJ evaluated the Veteran's LLE radiculopathy as paralysis of the external popliteal nerve (common peroneal). Those criteria provided that complete paralysis; foot drop and slight droop of the first phalanges of all toes, cannot dorsiflex the foot, extension (dorsal flexion) of proximal phalanges of toes lost; abduction of foot lost, adduction weakened; anesthesia covers entire dorsum of foot and toes, warrants the maximum, 40 percent, rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8521.

As noted, the Veteran has received the maximum allowable rating. The attorney has not cited to any evidence that would support an additional rating. The Board notes that the examination reports of record note sciatic nerve radiculopathy, but that disorder is not shown by the evidence of record to be associated with the VA medical care that led to the Veteran's LLE foot drop.

2. For accrued purposes only, entitlement to additional SMC at the next higher statutory rate is denied.

As noted, the AOJ granted SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k) and 38 CFR 3.350(a) on account of loss of use of one foot. See April 2023 Rating Decision Codesheet, P. 2. There is no evidence in the record at the time of the Veteran's death that he had any additional compensable disability that would have qualified him for SMC at a higher statutory rate. The medical evidence of record shows that he had not lost the natural action of his left knee. As noted, he was not blind in either eye. Hence, the evidence of record is persuasively against SMC at a higher statutory rate than that already granted. 

TDIU

Entitlement to a TDIU is denied.

Applicable Legal Requirements

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, where a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). To qualify for schedular consideration of a TDIU, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, and, if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. Id. The Veteran's total combined rating at the time of his death was 50 percent. See April 2023 Rating Decision Codesheet, P. 2.

It is the established policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service (Director), for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The rating board will include a full statement as to the veteran's service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment and all other factors having a bearing on the issue. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Discussion

The sole basis on which the attorney bases this claim is that the Veteran did not work after September 2013. See September 2023 VA Form 21-8940. The Board is aware that the Form was received after the April 2023 rating decision was issued. Nonetheless, the Board notes further that the issue of TDIU is raised by the evidence of record, not when the Form 8940 is received. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 453.

The Board notes that the fact that the Veteran may not worked again after September 2013 is not persuasive evidence that the LLE disability precluded him from all gainful employment. A VA outpatient entry notes that the Veteran reported that he had lost his job. See July 2014 CAPRI, 5th Entry, P. 16. Prior to his death, the Veteran reported that he had obtained a job in another state playing in a church band, and that he and his wife were relocating for him to take the job. See September 2022 CAPRI, P. 15. As of January 2022, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus and his LLE radiculopathy with foot drop precluded him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment. The Board finds no evidence of a reasonable possibility of unemployability that requires referral to the Director. See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). Hence, the Board is constrained to deny the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(b).
