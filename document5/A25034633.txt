ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition, to include degenerative arthritis, is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition, to include degenerative arthritis, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time the Veteran filed his May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, a prior higher-level review request as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition was pending final adjudication.

2. In a June 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to service connection for a left hand disability, which further renders the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition moot.

3. The Veteran has not had right hand degenerative arthritis during the pendency of this appeal.

4. A right hand condition was not manifested during service or for many years after service, and the weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's right hand condition is related to an event, injury, or disease in service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b), 20.104; Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1977).

2. The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served a period of honorable active service with the United States Marine Corps from July 2001 to July 2005, with an additional period of dishonorable service from July 2005 to March 2007.

In a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for degenerative arthritis of the bilateral hands.  In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a left and right hand condition.  In April 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the May 2023 and October 2023 rating decisions.  In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition and bilateral hand degenerative arthritis.  The AOJ found a duty-to-assist error in the October 2023 rating decision with regard to the left hand.  The Veteran appealed the April 2024 rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal for the denial of the claim of service connection for a right hand condition.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition, to include degenerative arthritis.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, within a year from the date of issuance of a decision a claimant may elect one of three review options: a request for higher-level review; a Board appeal; or a supplemental claim.  Where the claimant has elected one of those review options, they may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option.  Id. at 3.2500(b).

Here, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition was denied in an October 2023 rating decision.  In April 2024, the Veteran requested review of this decision by filing a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR).  While final adjudication of this requested review was pending, the Veteran included the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition in his May 2024 VA Form 10182.  Such concurrent election of review options is prohibited.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b).

Moreover, in a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition.  In light of the June 2024 rating decision, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a left hand condition is no longer before the Board as his claim was granted in full.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1977) (noting that a grant of service connection extinguishes appeals before the Board).

Thus, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition, to include degenerative arthritis.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right hand condition, to include degenerative arthritis.

A. Legal Criteria

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Lay evidence is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology and "may provide sufficient support for a claim of service connection."  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  When a condition is capable of lay observation and may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature."

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis when a layperson (1) is competent to identify the medical condition; or (2) is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) describes symptoms at the time which supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Although a lay person is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition, a lay person is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).  Likewise, mere conclusory or generalized lay statements that a service event or illness caused a current disability are insufficient.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010).

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992).  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).  This benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies if the competing evidence is nearly equal but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

B. Factual Background

A May 2005 service treatment record shows that the Veteran reported a two-week history of left hand pain after falling on his left hand.  He also reported swelling.  He was diagnosed with left hand sprain.  The Board notes that the reason for the Veteran's appointment lists "pain in right hand."  However, the Board finds that this was a typographical error in that the narrative portion of the sick call visit discusses only an injury to the left hand.  

During a September 2005 reenlistment examination, the Veteran reported that his "[o]nly recent health issue is some stiffness and swelling of L 5th finger, hyperextended playing basketball 2 weeks ago."  The examiner noted that the only "interval change is sprain left fifth finger."  Subsequent service treatment records do not reflect any hand complaints or treatment.  During the Veteran's January 2007 separation examination, he reported bilateral knee and foot pain.  He did not report any hand symptoms.  

VA treatment records are completely silent for hand complaints or treatment.

In his May 2023 claim, the Veteran reported that he had arthritis in both hands due to an in-service injury.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2023.  He reported that he fell and bent his fingers back on both hands.  He reported that he was given casts to both hands.  He also indicated that he was diagnosed with "mild degenerative arthritis" at a VAMC.  X-rays of the right hand showed soft tissue swelling.  They did not show arthritis.  The examiner noted diagnoses of left fifth finger soft tissue swelling and bilateral hand pain soreness.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's right hand condition was less likely as not related to service because there was no evidence of an in-service injury or medical attention for a right hand condition.  

C. Analysis

As an initial matter, the record shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with right hand pain.  As such, the Board finds the current disability element is established.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167.

As noted above, the Veteran's service treatment records contain no complaints or treatment related to a right hand condition.  Although service treatment records do show treatment for multiple conditions, including knee, ankle, foot, and left hand pain in service, the Veteran consistently described the pain as affecting his left hand throughout service, to include during his September 2005 reenlistment examination.  

The Board acknowledges recent statements the Veteran has made, including to the October 2023 VA examiner, in which he asserted that he injured his right hand in service.  The Veteran is competent to provide testimony regarding his military experiences, to include his accounts of injuring his right shoulder in service.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

However, any lay assertions from the Veteran regarding a right hand injury in service are less credible than the service treatment records, which directly contradict such lay statements by demonstrating no in-service right hand injury or symptomatology.  While the Veteran may currently assert that he suffered a right hand injury in service, those statements appear to be inaccurate recollections of past events, which are much less reliable than the in-service descriptions of his medical condition at that time.  The record clearly shows that the Veteran complained of left hand pain in service.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board is not asserting that the Veteran was lying.  Rather, the Board finds that such statements of an in-service right hand injury were inaccurate recollections of a history many years earlier, when compared against the service treatment records and contemporaneous post-service treatment records and are thus unreliable and entitled to no probative value.

The Board also acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that he has suffered from right hand pain since service.  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms such as pain.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  However, the Veteran's contentions that he has suffered from right hand pain since service are inconsistent with and contradicted by the record evidence.  As noted above, the evidence of record shows no complaints, diagnosis, or treatment for a right hand condition until the Veteran's May 2023 claim, almost 16 years after discharge.  The absence of post-service findings, diagnosis, or treatment for seven years after service is one factor that tends to weigh against a finding of continuous right shoulder symptoms after service separation.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that the Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence as one factor in determining credibility of lay evidence, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence); see also Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the passage of many years between discharge from active service and the medical documentation of a claimed disability is one factor to consider as evidence against a claim of service connection).  This lack of medical treatment tends to undermine the veracity of the Veteran's more recent statements that he has experienced right hand symptoms continually since service.  The Board also finds it probative that the Veteran sought treatment for multiple physical ailments, including knee, ankle, and foot pain during that time period, but failed to report any type of right hand symptoms.  See Williams v. Gov. of Virgin Islands, 271 F.Supp.2d 696, 702 (V.I.2003) (noting that statements made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment "are regarded as inherently reliable because of the recognition that one seeking medical treatment is keenly aware of the necessity for being truthful in order to secure proper care"); see also Fed. R. Evid. 803 (4) and accompanying Notes (noting statements made to physicians for purposes of diagnosis and treatment are exceptionally trustworthy because the declarant has a strong motive to tell the truth); Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997) (providing that although formal rules of evidence do not apply before the Board, recourse to the Federal Rules of Evidence may be appropriate).

The Board also finds it significant that the Veteran's previous applications for compensation did not include or mention a right hand condition.  See June 2014 Claim (knee, ankle, skin, PTSD); December 2016 Claim (ear condition); May 2018 Claim (PTSD, knee, ear); May 2019 Claim (migraine); November 2020 Claim (hearing loss, tinnitus); February 2021 Claim (foot, migraine); April 2021 Claim (bilateral ankle); December 2022 Claim (sleep apnea); see also Cromer v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 215 (2005) (upholding Board's denial of service connection and finding that a veteran's recent post-service account of in-service events was not credible because the Veteran had previously given other histories and theories that did not mention the alleged in-service event, and first "came up with the story" years after service and in connection with the compensation claim).This suggests to the Board that there was no pertinent right hand symptomatology at that time.  See AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (recognizing the widely held view that the absence of an entry in a record may be considered evidence that the fact did not occur if it appears that the fact would have been recorded if present).

It is important to point out that the Board does not find that the Veteran's lay statements lack credibility merely because they are unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[T]he Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.").  Rather, the current lay statements are found to lack credibility because they are inconsistent with and directly contradicted by other lay and medical evidence of record, including the Veteran's own statements, showing that the Veteran did not experience right hand symptoms in service or until many years after service.  See Madden, 125 F.3d at 1481 (finding Board entitled to discount the credibility of evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 512 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (upholding Board's finding that a Veteran was not credible because lay evidence about a wound in service was internally inconsistent with other lay statements that he had not received any wounds in service).

There is also no competent evidence or opinion even suggesting that there exists a medical nexus between any currently diagnosed right hand condition and service.

In this regard, the Board finds the October 2023 VA opinion to be highly persuasive to the issue at hand.  The Board notes that the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, his knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and his medical conclusion.  As is true with any piece of evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to these opinions are within the province of the adjudicator.  Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).  Whether a physician provides a basis for his or her medical opinion goes to the weight or credibility of the evidence in the adjudication of the merits.  See Hernandez-Toyens v. West, 11 Vet. App. 379, 382 (1998).  Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims folder and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000).

Here, the October 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's current right hand condition was less likely than not related to his service and more likely related to post-service activities.  Although the VA examiner emphasized that service treatment records were silent for a right hand injury or treatment, as well as the length of time before the Veteran sought treatment after service, this does not render the opinion inadequate.  A VA examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the incurrence of a disorder, and his statements regarding the continuity of symptomatology.  Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39-40 (2007).  Here, the examiner acknowledged and accepted the Veteran's reports of experiencing occasional right hand pain in service; however, the examiner explained why the current right hand condition was nonetheless more likely due to post-service factors.  Moreover, in the present case, as discussed in detail above, the Board has found that the Veteran's lay statements regarding onset and continuity to not be entirely credible.  Implicit in the examiner's rationale was that if the Veteran's right hand symptoms had been significant, he would have sought treatment earlier.

Additionally, "there is no reasons or bases requirement imposed on examiners."  Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293 (2012).  Rather, an adequate medical report must rest on correct facts and reasoned medical judgment so as to inform the Board on a medical question and facilitate the Board's consideration and weighing of the report against any contrary reports.  See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304 (2008) (holding, in the context of weighing one medical opinion with another, that "[i]t is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion... that contributes probative value to a medical opinion").  Overall, the October 2023 VA medical opinion was thorough, supported by an explanation, based on examination of the Veteran and review of the claims folder, and supported by the Veteran's lay statements and medical records.  Furthermore, the conclusions are consistent with the evidence of record, including service treatment records showing no reported right hand symptoms and post-service treatment records showing an absence of any right hand complaints for many years after service.

The Board also acknowledges any assertion by the Veteran that his right hand condition is related to his military service.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), determining the etiology of a right hand condition falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  In this regard, while the Veteran can competently report his symptoms, any opinion regarding the nature and etiology of his right hand condition requires medical expertise that the Veteran has not demonstrated.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1376 (2007).  As such, the Board assigns no probative weight to the Veteran's assertions that his current right hand condition is related to service.

Finally, the Board finds that the Veteran has not had a diagnosis of right hand arthritis at any time during the appeal period as shown by x-rays taken during the October 2023 VA examination.  

Based on a review of the record evidence, the Board concludes that service connection for a right hand condition is not warranted.  Although the record evidence shows that the Veteran currently has a right hand condition, it does not indicate that the Veteran's right hand condition has a causal connection to or is associated with his active military service.  While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's claims, taking into account all of the relevant evidence of record, the weight of the evidence is against a finding of an etiological relationship between the Veteran's current right hand condition and his military service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to service connection for a right hand condition must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the weight of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).
