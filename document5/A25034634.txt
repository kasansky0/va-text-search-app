REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 1986 to May 1999. 

By way of procedural history, an intent to file was submitted in January 2022. A claim for service connection for PTSD was submitted in November 2022. Service connection for PTSD was granted in a July 2023 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim in September 2023 and a VA Form 21-8940, Application for TDIU in September 2023. An October 2023 rating decision granted an increased rating for PTSD and entitlement to TDIU. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) in October 2023. An informal HLR conference was held in March 2024. The March 2024 HLR rating decision denied the claims and considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision. The Veteran appealed with a June 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent prior to September 14, 2023 and in excess of 50 percent thereafter for PTSD, to include an effective date earlier than September 14, 2023 for the grant of a 50 percent rating. 

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated as 30 percent disabling from January 13, 2022 to September 13, 2023 and as 50 percent disabling from September 14, 2023 to present. 

The June 2024 VA Form 10182 indicates the Veteran is seeking both an earlier effective date for the grant of an increased rating as well as ratings in excess of 30 percent prior to September 14, 2023 and 50 percent thereafter. 

Generally, the effective date for increases in initial disability ratings is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

The effective date for increases in disability ratings is the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred if a complete claim or intent to file a claim is received within 1 year from such date, otherwise, date of receipt of claim. When medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish effective date(s) for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within 1 year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The Board notes that, under the modernized review system of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). The Veteran may establish continuous pursuit following an initial AOJ decision by filing one of three different appeals options within one year of the decision. The three options are a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), Request for HLR (VA Form 20-0996), or Decision Review Request: Board Appeal Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182). 

In the present case, an intent to file was submitted in January 2022 and a claim for service connection for PTSD was submitted in November 2022. The July 2023 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial disability rating of 30 percent effective from January 13, 2022. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim and application for TDIU on September 14, 2023. This is within the 1-year appeal period of the July 2023 rating decision. The October 2023 rating decision granted an increased rating of 50 percent and entitlement to a TDIU effective September 14, 2023. Thereafter, the Veteran timely filed appeals by way of an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996 and June 2024 VA Form 10182. The Board concludes she continuously pursued her claims since the January 2022 intent to file. 

Given that the Veteran continuously pursued the claim, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date of January 13, 2022 (the date an intent to file was submitted) for the grant of an increased rating of 50 percent is possible as long as entitlement to a higher rating for PTSD is shown based on the rating criteria. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

Under the General Formula, a 50 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

Having reviewed the record, the Board concludes that an initial disability rating of 70 percent, but no higher, is warranted with an earlier effective date of January 13, 2022. 

VA and private treatment records, the November 2022 and October 2023 VA examinations, and the Veteran's lay statements show that her PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 70 percent rating (difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances), symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating (impaired abstract thinking; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships), and symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating (depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). 

Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, a review of the evidence shows the Veteran had difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances for the entirety of the appeal period, particularly with respect to the circumstances of her military sexual trauma. See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017). In a September 2022 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported that she had avoided telling her son about his father for years. She stated that her symptoms worsened after telling her son and endorsed symptoms of avoidance, increased anxiety and palpitations in social situations, thinking there is "something wrong with" herself, and difficulty trusting others. During the November 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that she had told her son that his dad died, but she "lost it" when her son wanted to seek his ancestry results. Her son confirmed her statement in a November 2022 lay witness statement. Further, in a November 2022 VA treatment record, she stated that depressive symptoms made it extremely difficult to do her work, take care of things at home, or get along with others. During the October 2023 VA examination, the examiner determined the Veteran had difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances. Based on the above, and resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding the Veteran had difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances for the entire period on appeal. As this is a symptom enumerated under the criteria for a 70 percent rating, the Board concludes that this would approximate a 70 percent rating. 

As discussed above, this appeal arises from the January 13, 2022 intent to file and the November 2022 claim for service connection for PTSD. Given that the Veteran continuously pursued the claim since the January 13, 2022 intent to file, the Board will resolve doubt in the Veteran's favor and find that entitlement to a 70 percent rating is warranted from January 13, 2022. In short, the Veteran's continuous pursuit of the claim preserved an earlier effective date of the initial claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

Thus, an initial disability rating of 70 percent, but no higher, effective from January 13, 2022 for PTSD is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 14, 2023 for the grant of a TDIU.  

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than September 14, 2023 for the grant of a TDIU. 

A total disability rating may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that, if there is only one such disability, this disability shall be ratable at 60 percent or more, or if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

Generally, a TDIU claim is treated as a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to the TDIU claim. See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000). As discussed above, the Veteran's claim for an increased rating and earlier effective date for the grant of an increased rating for PTSD was continuously pursued since the submission of the January 13, 2022 intent to file. 

As the result of the Board's PTSD disability rating grant, the Veteran's service connected disabilities combine for 90 percent. Thus, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria. 

The evidence of record does not persuasively reflect that any single service-connected disability to include PTSD has rendered her unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. Rather, the October 2023 grant of TDIU was based on both service-connected PTSD and migraine headaches. The Veteran is currently service-connected for multiple disabilities and has contended mainly that her PTSD, migraine headaches, and hypothyroidism in combination have rendered her unemployable. See August 2023 VA Form 21-8940. These disabilities collectively affect the Veteran's mental ability and physical ability to perform the activities required by employment. Accordingly, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of January 13, 2022 for the award of TDIU is warranted. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 14, 2023 for the grant of eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35. 

Regarding the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for DEA benefits pursuant to 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, the Board finds that entitlement to an effective date of January 13, 2022 is warranted.

Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance, under Chapter 35, Title 38, of the United States Code, is a program of education or special restorative training that may be authorized for an eligible person if the applicable criteria are met. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021.

Basic eligibility for certification of DEA exists if the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service, and either (1) has a permanent total service-connected disability, or (2) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death, or (3) died as a result of a service-connected disability, or, if a service member (4) is on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces and, for a period of more than 90 days, has been listed by VA concerned as missing in action, captured in the line of duty by a hostile force, or forcibly detained or interned in the line of duty by a foreign government or power. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

This decision's grant of a TDIU from January 13, 2022 results in a permanent total service-connected disability. Thus, the Board concludes that entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 13, 2022 for basic eligibility to DEA benefits is warranted.
