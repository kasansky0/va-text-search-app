FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in this appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by an appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from November 1985 to June 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2024 rating decision.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38?C.F.R. §?20.205(a). Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative and must include the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. 38?C.F.R. §?20.205(a), (b). 

The Veteran's representative filed a new VA Form 10182 and an accompanying correspondence in February 2025, stating that the Veteran wished to withdraw her October 2024 appeal to pursue review of a different rating decision. The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal satisfies the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegation of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
