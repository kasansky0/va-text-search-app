ORDER

The reduction in the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease was not proper; restoration of the 60 percent evaluation, effective July 1, 2024, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The July 2024 rating decision which reduced the disability rating for coronary artery disease did not reflect consideration of the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 and is void ab initio.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The reduction of the evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected connected coronary artery disease from 60 percent to 30, effective July 1, 2024, is not supported and restoration of the Veteran's 60 percent disability rating is warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.105, 3.344, 4.97.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to July 1993.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision for the issue on appeal; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.302.

The Board acknowledges that the time period for requesting a docket change has not expired.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  In this case, the Veteran has been represented by counsel who has submitted a written brief relying on evidence of record before the AOJ.  In this case, the AOJ actions have taken away compensation benefits to the Veteran, and the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in expediting this decision to bring him back to status quo financially. 

In determining whether a reduction was proper, there are two sequential questions that must be addressed.  First, whether the AOJ satisfied the procedural requirements for a reduction, as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  If so, the second question concerns whether the evidence shows an improvement in the severity of the service-connected disability, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344.

Without regard to whether a rating has been in effect for five years or more, a rating reduction is warranted only where the evidence demonstrates an actual improvement in disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.13.  In other words, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2 and 4.10 require that "in any rating-reduction case not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work."  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993); Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000).

Moreover, reports of examination must be interpreted in the light of the whole evidentiary history and reconciled with the various reports into a consistent picture, so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  In short, "the Board must 'establish, by a preponderance of the evidence and in compliance [with] 38 C.F.R. § 3.344, that a rating reduction is warranted.'"  Green v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 512 (2006).  If there is any doubt, the rating in effect will be continued.  See Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 417-18.

In general, the AOJ's reduction of a rating must have been supported by evidence on file at the time of the reduction.  Pertinent post-reduction evidence favorable to restoring the rating, however, also must be considered.  See Dofflemyer, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1992).  In addressing whether improvement is shown, the comparison point generally is the last examination on which the rating at issue was assigned or continued.  See Hohol v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 169 (1992).

Upon consideration of the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board concludes that reduction of the disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected coronary artery disease from 60 percent to 30 percent was improper.

In this case, the AOJ's July 2024 rating decision reduced the rating for coronary artery disease from 60 percent disabled to 30 percent disabled on the basis of a November 2023 VA examination.  The examiner conducted an interview-based METs test, determining the Veteran demonstrated 5-7 METs and experienced breathlessness with any physical activity.  The examiner noted the Veteran may have difficulty with completing moderate-to-vigorous activities.

The Board finds that the AOJ failed to properly make findings in this case as to both prongs of the Faust test for rating reduction cases.  The adjudicatory documents do not demonstrate that the AOJ made a finding with respect to whether the improvement noted reflected "an improvement in the Appellant's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work" to support the rating reduction.  Additionally, the examiner provided an estimation of METs values and there is no explanation as to why the Veteran's cardiac condition has improved - rather than a different subjective estimation of METs than a prior examiner.

Accordingly, the action to reduce the rating is void and the 60 percent evaluation for coronary artery disease is restored effective July 1, 2024, as though the reduction had not occurred.  See Faust, supra.  In so reaching that conclusion, the Board has appropriately applied the benefit of the doubt doctrine in this case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
