FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On April 14, 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's service connection claim for IBS, which was subsequently granted and considered effective on that date; prior to April 14, 2022, the Veteran had no pending unadjudicated claim or any other written communication that could be construed as a claim for IBS.

2. On March 31, 2021, VA received the Veteran's service connection claim for CFS, which was subsequently granted and considered effective on that date; prior to March 31, 2021, the Veteran no pending unadjudicated claim or any other written communication that could be construed as a claim for CFS.

3. For the period prior to February 19, 2022, the Veteran's CFS symptoms did not wax and wane, did not result in any periods of incapacitation, and the Veteran did not take medications for CFS.

4. For the period from February 19, 2022, the Veteran's CFS symptoms were nearly constant and restricted routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of his pre-illness level.

5. At no time approximate to the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a diagnosis of a hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes. 

6. The Veteran's hypertension did not originate in service or until years thereafter and is not otherwise etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to April 14, 2022, for the award of service connection for IBS, are not met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to March 31, 2021, for the award of service connection for CFS, are not met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of a 60 percent disability rating for CFS, are met. 38?U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.400, 4.7, 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6354.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

5. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Marine Corps from December 1984 to September 1991. See DD Form 214.  His military occupational specialty (MOS) was military policeman.  Id.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 Higher-Level Review of rating decisions dated in March 2023 (bilateral hearing loss, vertigo, cervical spine, CFS, and TDIU) and May 2023 (headaches, hypertension, IBS, and acquired psychiatric disorder) of VA's Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  VA received the Veteran's notice of disagreement (NOD) with these determinations in January 2024, via VA Form 10182, whereon he selected the Board's Direct Review docket.

Applicable Evidentiary Windows

As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issues on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Veteran has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.  See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, a headache disability, vertigo, and a cervical spine disability, as well as entitlement to an effective date prior to September 12, 2022, for the grant of a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider with respect to these claims will be considered by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Applicable Law

The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the claim for service connection is received within one year of a veteran's discharge from service, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following discharge from service or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). 38 C.F.R. §3.400 also provides, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of a rating and award of compensation based on an initial claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 14, 2022, for the initial grant of service connection for IBS, is denied.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the effective date of April 14, 2022, for the grant of service connection for IBS. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

On April 14, 2022, VA received the service connection claim for IBS. This was the Veteran's initial application for benefits regarding any gastrointestinal condition. Benefits have been awarded from April 14, 2022, the date on which VA received the initial claim that resulted in the award. As a result, the Board finds no basis upon which to award an EED. 38 C.F.R. §3.400. 

Thus, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. §5110 and 38 C.F.R. §3.400, an effective date prior to April 14, 2022, is not warranted and there is no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 31, 2021, for the initial grant service connection for CFS, is denied. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date of February 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of a 60 percent disability rating for CFS, is granted.

The Veteran was assigned an initial noncompensable rating effective March 31, 2021, and a 60 percent rating effective September 12, 2022, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 6354. 

The Veteran generally disagrees with the effective dates assigned for his CFS. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. The Board construes this disagreement to be with both the effective date of March 31, 2021, for the initial grant of CFS and the effective date of September 12, 2022, for the grant of a 60 percent disability rating for CFS. 

As to the initial grant of service connection for CFS, VA received the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for body aches and fatigue on March 31, 2021. This was the Veteran's initial application for benefits pertinent to CFS or any symptoms associated therewith. Benefits were awarded from March 31, 2021, the date on which VA received the initial claim that resulted in the award. As a result, the Board finds no basis upon which to award an effective date prior to March 31, 2021, for the initial grant of service connection. 38 C.F.R. §3.400. There is no doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The next question is whether the Veteran is entitled to an effective date prior to September 12, 2022, for the grant of a 60 percent disability rating for CFS. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 6354. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.88b, DC 6354, CFS ratings are provided for symptoms including debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairments (such as inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, confusion), or a combination of other signs and symptoms. Specifically, CFS is rated as follows:

A 10 percent disability rating for symptoms that wax and wane but result in periods of incapacitation of at least one but less than two weeks total duration per year; or symptoms controlled by continuous medication. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for signs and symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities by less than 25 percent of the pre-illness level, or; signs and symptoms that wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least two but less than four weeks total duration per year. 

A 40 percent rating is warranted for signs and symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to 50 to 75 percent of the pre-illness level, or; the signs and symptoms wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least four but less than six weeks total duration per year. 

A 60 percent rating is warranted for signs and symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome that are nearly constant and restrict routine daily activities to less than 50 percent of the pre-illness level, or signs and symptoms that wax and wane, resulting in periods of incapacitation of at least six weeks total duration per year. 

A 100 percent rating is warranted for signs and symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome that are nearly constant and so severe as to restrict routine daily activities almost completely and which may occasionally preclude self-care.

See 38 C.F.R. § 4.88b, DC 6354.

In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138 and stated: "I experienced pain in my joints, feeling depressed, fatigued, anxiety unable to asleep and my heart was fluctuating when I returned back from the Gulf War and still felt the same way." 

On February 18, 2022, in a VA medical report, the VA clinician diagnosed the Veteran with CFS, and the Veteran stated he felt tired all the time, didn't sleep well, and was told he suffered from sleep apnea. The VA clinician found that the Veteran did not take any medicine for his CFS, and that he did not have debilitating fatigue or a reduced daily activity level to less than 50% of pre-illness level. Further, the VA clinician found that the Veteran did not "have or has the Veteran had any findings, signs, or symptoms attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome" and did not "now have or had the Veteran had any cognitive impairment attributable to chronic fatigue syndrome." As to functional impact, the VA clinician stated that CFS would cause the Veteran to "have difficulty working at a job that required excessive physical activity such was walking, running, lifting etc. due to fatigue." 

Approximately six months later, on September 12, 2022, a VA medical report on Veteran's CFS shows that the examiner diagnosed the Veteran with CFS and noted his current symptoms were that he was tired all the time. The examiner found that the Veteran's "debilitating fatigue reduced daily activity level to less than 50% of pre-illness level" and that has occurred for over six months. His symptoms associated with the CFS were debilitating fatigue, generalized muscle aches or weakness, fatigue lasting 24 hours or longer after exercise, headaches (of a type, severity or pattern that is different from headaches in the pre-morbid state), migratory joint pain, and sleep disturbances. It was noted that the "Veteran reports debilitating fatigue after any physical activity with generalized muscle aches/pains occurring daily. Reports difficulty with sleep although tired all the time. Reports recurrent headaches." 

Giving the benefit of doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that when looking at the record as a whole, the Veteran is entitled to a rating on 60 percent from February 19, 2022. The Board finds that effective date based upon the September 12, 2022, VA medical report on Veteran's CFS that showed "debilitating fatigue reduced daily activity level to less than 50% of pre-illness level" and the finding that it has occurred for over six months. Going back in time from September 2022, reveals that over six months prior, on February 18, 2022, a VA examiner found that the Veteran did not take any medicine for his CFS, and that the Veteran did not have debilitating fatigue reduced daily activity level to less than 50% of pre-illness level. As such, the Board has given the effective date of the day after the February 18, 2022, VA examination for the 60 percent rating based upon the September 12, 2020, VA medical report.  An effective date earlier than February 19, 2022, is not warranted as the records clearly demonstrates that the CFS did not require medication and there were no periods of incapacitation. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 6354. 

As such, for the foregoing reasons, and resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for a rating of 60 percent are met as of February 19, 2022, but no earlier. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024.

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in disability. In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a Veteran has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. In Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a Veteran filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The Court has indicated that the threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels and that higher thresholds show some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993). The absence of in-service evidence of hearing loss is not fatal to a claim for service connection. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as noted above) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss. Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159.

Service treatment records do not show hearing loss for VA purposes and VA has conceded that the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Military Police has a moderate probability of hazardous noise exposure. See DD Form 214.

In January 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA hearing loss examination, but the examiner determined that the hearing loss test results were not valid for rating purposes as the Veteran provided inconsistent and unreliable responses. Thereafter, in September 2022, the Veteran underwent another VA hearing loss examination, but the examiner again determined that the hearing loss test results were not valid for rating purposes as the Veteran provided inconsistent and unreliable responses. 

In March 2023, the Veteran underwent another examination. For the right ear, testing showed decibel loss at the puretone threshold as: 15 at 500Hz, 25 at 1000Hz, 15 at 2000Hz, 15 at 3000Hz, 25 at 4000Hz, 25 at 6000Hz and 30 at 8000Hz. For the left ear, testing showed dB loss at the puretone threshold as: 15 at 500 Hz, 25 at 1000Hz, 20 at 2000Hz, 20 at 3000Hz, 25 at 4000Hz, 30 at 6000Hz and 25 at 8000Hz. MD speech discrimination scores reveal 100 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left ear. 

Based on the evidence of record, the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of hearing loss for Vac purposes at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). Without evidence of a current disability, the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a); Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

Although the Veteran experienced subjective symptoms of hearing loss, the issue of hearing loss is medically complex, as it requires the administration and interpretation of complicated diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence of March 2023. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. Based on this evidence, the criteria for service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability are not met. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67. The appeal as to this issue must be denied.

Lastly, the Board has considered the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) that was signed into law on August 10, 2022. The PACT Act included changes to medical examination requirements where there is documented TERA. Under 38 U.S.C. § 1168, a disability examination and medical opinion may be requested for certain non-presumptive conditions involving TERA. When a medical opinion involving a TERA is requested, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran-claimant. A VA Memorandum was issued in March 2023 that found that the Veteran participated in a TERA; he participated in Operation Desert Shield from August 1990 to April 1991. Hearing loss is not an exception to the PACT Act requirements for a VA medical opinion regarding TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a)(1)(B). However, as there is no evidence that the Veteran has met the regulatory threshold for hearing loss benefits at any point during the appeal period, a VA TERA examination is not warranted, and service connection cannot be granted as he does not have a current hearing loss disability as a matter of law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

5. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

Here, the November 2023 HLR rating decision found that the Veteran participated in a TERA and that the medical evidence establishes that the Veteran has hypertension, as such the remaining question is whether the Veteran's hypertension is related to service. Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1166-67.

The Veteran's service treatment records do not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for hypertension and there is no medical evidence to show the Veteran's hypertension is related to service. Post-service medical records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension over a decade after his separation from service. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2022 and the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension. In the examination, the Veteran stated the condition started in service. Thereafter, in September 2022, a VA examiner reviewed the records and opined that the hypertension was not related to service.

The Veteran then underwent another VA examination in April 2023, and he was diagnosed with hypertension. The examiner then issued a TERA opinion on the issue and found that hypertension is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated TERA after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran. As rationale, the examiner stated that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of hypertension and the TERA. The examiner noted that most hypertension is essential hypertension, which means it develops on its own.

In this case, the positive evidence of record consists primarily of the Veteran's general lay statements. As to the Veteran's lay statements, the Board finds that he is competent to report matters which he personally observed or experienced, as well as what has been related to him by medical professionals. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. However, the Veteran is not competent to offer opinions on complex medical questions requiring specialized knowledge, such as the physiological causes of his hypertension. Further the Veteran has not actually alleged that his hypertension was diagnosed in service or within one year of separation from service or that he was told by any medical professional that his hypertension was incurred in service or otherwise related to service. 

In contrast, VA medical professional have reviewed the record and opined that the Veteran's hypertension was unlikely to have been caused by service, to include the documented TERA. In light of the detailed, fact-specific, evidence-based, and logical nature of the VA examinations of June 2022 and April 2023 VA opinion, the Board finds them most probative. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 303 (2008). Thus, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran's hypertension was incurred in service or is otherwise related to service, to include as due to his documented TERA. 

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's current hypertension was incurred in service, within one year of service, or is in any way causally linked to service, to include as due to the documented TERA. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is remanded.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, to include adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, chronic. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

Here, the record reflects that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. See HLR Rating decision dated November 2023; VA examination, dated December 2021.

On May 5, 2023, VA obtained several opinions on whether the Veteran's mental disorder, to include adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, chronic, were secondary to his service-connected CFS, tinnitus, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and right and left shoulder conditions and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. The examiner found that the Veteran did not currently have a mental disorder and therefore, none of the conditions were related. However, as noted above, the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood in a December 2021 VA examination. 

As such, the Board finds that additional development is required to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the May 23, 2023, rating decision on appeal. The Board finds that the May 5, 2023, VA medical opinions are inadequate as they did not consider the prior diagnosis from December 2021 of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood, and they lack an adequate rationale for the opinions. Further, they are inadequate as it did not adequately address secondary service connection. In this regard, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit restated the standard for proving secondary service connection, stating that secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2023). Thus, remand is warranted for new opinions on the issue of secondary service connection.

2. Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is remanded.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

Here, the record reflects that service treatment records in July 1989 note complaints of headaches and that the Veteran has a current diagnosis for migraine headaches. See HLR Rating decision dated November 2023.

In January 2023, the Veteran submitted a medical article that dealt with the tinnitus and headaches; the Veteran is service-connected for tinnitus. See HLR Rating decision Codesheet, dated November 2023.

In response to the January 2023 article, in April 2023, a VA examiner reviewed the Veteran's records and diagnosed the Veteran with migraine headaches. The examiner then noted he was asked to address if the Veteran's migraine headaches were secondary to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus. In response the examiner opined that "[t]he claimed condition is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) proximately due to or the result of the veteran's service connected condition of tinnitus." As rationale, the examiner stated the "risk factors for developing migraines are family history, age, sex, and hormonal changes.  Tinnitus, though a common trigger of migraines, does not cause development of the migraine condition itself.  Therefore, it is less likely than not that the Veteran's migraines are proximately due to and/or the result of tinnitus."  

The Board finds that additional development is required to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the May 2023 rating decision on appeal. The Board finds that the April 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate as it lacks an adequate rationale for the opinion. Further, it is inadequate as it did not adequately address secondary service connection. As noted above, secondary causation exists when, but for the service-connected disability, the non-service-connected was caused by a service-connected disability either in a direct, etiological way or via multiple steps in a causal chain. Spicer, 61 F.4th at 1365. Thus, remand is warranted for a new opinion on the issue of direct and secondary service connection.

3. Entitlement to service connection for vertigo is remanded.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for vertigo. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

As part of the PACT Act, VA's duty to assist requires it provide an examination and medical opinion when there is evidence of a disability, evidence exists that a claimant engaged in a TERA, and the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection of that disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a).

In this case, the Veteran has confirmed service in the Southwest Asia theatre of operations which is a location presumed associated with toxic exposure. See DD Form 214; VA Memorandums date December 3, 2022, and January 2023. Further, a March 2023 VA Memorandum confirms the Veteran's participated in a TERA. 

To date, the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to consider if the claimed vertigo is related to a TERA or under the theory that any undiagnosed symptoms may constitute a medically undiagnosed chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI). Thus, an examination should be conducted which considers the Veteran's vertigo claim under the TERA or MUCMI theories of service connection.

4. Entitlement to service connection for a neck condition is remanded.

The Veteran generally disagrees with the denial of his claim of entitlement to service connection for a neck condition. See VA Form 10182, dated January 2024. 

As part of the PACT Act, VA's duty to assist requires it provide an examination and medical opinion when there is evidence of a disability, evidence exists that a claimant engaged in a TERA, and the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection of that disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). The only exception to the TERA examination and opinion requirement occurs when the Secretary determines there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and the TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b). Here, the exception described in 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b) is not applicable to the Veteran's neck condition claim. See VBA Letter 20-22-10, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022). 

In this case, the Veteran has confirmed service in the Southwest Asia theatre of operations which is a location presumed associated with toxic exposure. See DD Form 214; VA Memorandums dated December 3, 2022, and January 2023. Further, a March 2023 VA Memorandum confirms the Veteran's participated in a TERA. 

To date, the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination to consider if the claimed neck condition is related to a TERA or under the theory that any undiagnosed symptoms may constitute a MUCMI. Thus, remand for an examination to be conducted that considers the Veteran's neck claim under the TERA or MUCMI theories of service connection is warranted.

5. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 12, 2022, for TDIU is remanded.

The Board finds the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU to be inextricably intertwines with the claims being remanded herein. As such, remand is required. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA Mental Health examination to assess his claim of entitlement to service connection for a mental disorder, including adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood. The Veteran's claims file must be accessible for review by the VA examiner(s). All testing deemed necessary by the examiners should be performed and the results reported in detail. A detailed rationale for all opinions should be provided. The examiner shall answer the following questions:

(a.) Whether the diagnosed adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood had its onset during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. The examiner should elicit a full history from the Veteran and consider any lay statements of record. The Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, and if there is a medical basis to support or doubt the history provided by the Veteran the examiner should provide a fully reasoned explanation. 

(b.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected CFS, he would not have a current disability of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood.

(c.) Whether the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected CFS. 

(d.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus, he would not have a current disability of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood.

(e.) Whether the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus. 

(f.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, he would not have a current disability of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood.

(g.) Whether the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 

(h.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected right and left shoulder conditions and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis, he would not have a current disability of adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood.

(i.) Whether the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected right and left shoulder conditions and acromioclavicular joint osteoarthritis. 

(j.) If the examiner opines, that the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood would result in less functional impairment but for any of the service-connected mentioned above, the examiner must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed disability prior to aggravation by the primary service-connected disability/disabilities.  

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA Headaches examination to assess his claim of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches. The Veteran's claims file must be accessible for review by the VA examiner(s). All testing deemed necessary by the examiners should be performed and the results reported in detail. A detailed rationale for all opinions should be provided. The examiner shall answer the following questions:

(a.) Whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus, he would not have a current disability of migraine headaches.

(b.) Whether the Veteran's migraines headaches would be less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus. 

(c.) If the examiner opines that the migraine headaches would result in less functional impairment but for the service-connected tinnitus, the examiner must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed disability prior to aggravation by the primary service-connected disability.  

3. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to assess his claim of service connection for vertigo. The Veteran's claims file must be accessible for review by the VA examiner. All testing deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed and the results reported in detail. The examiner shall answer the following questions:

(a.) If the claimed disability cannot be medically diagnosed, the examiner should provide an explanation for that non-diagnosis, to include an opinion as to whether the reported symptoms are part of or constitute a MUCMI.

(b.) For each diagnosed disorder, the examiner is requested to state whether that disorder (1) had onset during active service or (2) is otherwise related to any incident of active service, to include conceded toxic exposure experienced during active service. In addressing the Veteran's TERA, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments, and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic risk activities. 

4. Schedule the Veteran for a TERA examination to assess his claim of service connection for a neck condition. The Veteran's claims file must be accessible for review by the VA examiner(s). All testing deemed necessary by the examiners should be performed and the results reported in detail. A detailed rationale for all opinions should be provided. The examiner shall answer the following questions:

(a.) If the claimed disability cannot be medically diagnosed, the examiner should provide an explanation for that non-diagnosis, to include an opinion as to whether the reported symptoms are part of or constitute a MUCMI.

(b.) For each diagnosed disorder, the examiner is requested to state whether that disorder (1) had onset during active service or (2) is otherwise related to any incident of active service, to include conceded toxic exposure experienced during active service. In addressing the Veteran's TERA, the examiner must consider the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments, and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic risk activities. 

5.  After the above development, and any additional development that may deemed necessary, readjudicate the issues, to include the inextricably intertwined issue of entitlement to an EED for TDIU.

A clear rationale for all opinions must be provided and a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved would be of considerable assistance to the Board.
