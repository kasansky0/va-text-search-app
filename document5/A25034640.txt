ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 31, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of January 31, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for an increased rating for his service-connected back disability that was received by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) on January 31, 2022, which was sympathetically inferred to include a claim for separate compensable ratings for associated right and left lower extremity radiculopathy.

2. Prior to January 31, 2022, there was no formal claim or Intent to File a Claim received by VA pertaining to either the Veteran's service-connected back disability or any associated lower extremity radiculopathy. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of January 31, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400 (2024).

2. The criteria for an effective date of January 31, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1990 to February 1991 and from May 1991 to May 1995.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). Initially, the Veteran was granted entitlement to separate compensable ratings for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy in a May 2022 rating decision, effective May 10, 2022. In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of the effective date assigned for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy allowance in the May 2022 rating decision. The August 2023 HLR rating decision on appeal was issued in response to that request. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date - Left and Right Lower Extremity Radiculopathy

The Veteran contends that the grant of service connection for his left and right lower extremity radiculopathy warrants an earlier effective date. 

Generally, and except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

An exception to the general rule applies where evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of the claim for increased compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). Specifically, when medical records indicate an increase in a disability, receipt of such medical records may be used to establish effective date(s) for retroactive benefits based on facts found of an increase in a disability only if a complete claim or intent to file a claim for an increase is received within 1 year of the date of the report of examination, hospitalization, or medical treatment. If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). 

By way of history, the Veteran was service connected for lumbar spine degenerative disc disease in a December 1995 rating decision. In February 2013, the Veteran filed for an increased rating for his degenerative disc disease, which was denied in a February 2013 rating decision. The Veteran timely filed a notice of disagreement but failed to perfect the appeal after a statement of the case was issued in March 2016; thus, the February 2013 rating decision became final. The Veteran again filed for an increased rating for his back disability in, and that claim was received by VA on January 31, 2022. In the identified May 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to an increased 10 percent rating for his back, and entitlement to separate compensable ratings for associated left and right lower extremity radiculopathy, both effective May 10, 2022, - the date of the most recent VA back examination. 

Initially, the Board notes that neither the Veteran nor his attorney have made any specific arguments pertaining to the earlier effective date claim. 

In this case, the date of the claim is January 31, 2022. It is settled law that the effective date for the grant of service connection following a final decision is the date of the reopened claim. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 248 (2002) ("the Court thus holds that the effective date statute, 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), is clear on its face with respect to granting an effective date for an award of VA periodic monthly benefits no earlier than the date that the claim for reopening was filed"). In the Sears case, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) explained that the statutory framework did not allow for the Board to reach back to the date of the original claim as a possible effective date for an award of service-connected benefits that is predicated upon a reopened claim. The Court explained that the term, new claim, as it appeared in 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), means a claim to reopen a previously and finally decided claim.

Thus, because the February 2013 rating decision denying an increased rating for the Veteran's back disability became final, the January 31, 2022, supplemental claim is considered a "new" claim for purposes of assignment of an effective date.

The Board has reviewed the claims file and finds no formal, informal, or intent to file a claim for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy prior to January 31, 2022. The Board notes that to the extent that the Veteran may have had symptoms and sought medical treatment for the claimed disability prior to January 31, 2022, the mere existence of medical records generally cannot be construed as an informal claim; rather, there must be some intent by the claimant to apply for a benefit. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998); Criswell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 501, 504 (2006).

Regarding the date entitlement arose, VA examinations from February 2015 and February 2022 indicated that no radiculopathy was detected. However, private treatment records submitted by the Veteran after the February 2022 VA examination indicate that he was treated for shooting pain in his left leg as early as January 2010 and intermittent right leg pain with right thigh involvement as early as April 2012. In a May 2022 VA examination, bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was confirmed. Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board thus concludes that the January 2010 and April 2012 treatment dates are the dates entitlement arose for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy, respectively, as these constitute the first indication in the record that the Veteran had lower extremity radiculopathy that may be related to service, or secondarily related to a service-connected disability. 

Considering that the effective date for service connection is the later of the date of claim or date entitlement arose, the January 31, 2022, date of claim is the most appropriate effective date.

As the award of service connection for bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was based on an increased rating claim, the Board has also considered the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), which permits the payment of increased disability benefits retroactively to the date the evidence establishes the increase in disability occurred if the claim or intent to file claim is received within 1 year from that date. However, in this case, the evidence indicates that the Veteran was experiencing intermittent symptoms of radiculopathy well before his January 2022 supplemental claim for increase. See January 2010 Private Treatment Records; April 2012 Private Treatment Records. That is, his disabilities did not increase during the period on appeal, and even if his entitlement arose as early as 2010, regulations provide that if no factually ascertainable increase in disability has occurred, the effective date must be the date of receipt of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

The Board also notes that the Veteran did submit an Intent to File a Claim that was received by VA on October 28, 2021. However, that Intent to File was followed by a complete claim received by VA on January 14, 2022. As such, the Intent to File would not stand to preserve an effective date for an award based on a subsequent complete claim after the received of the January 14, 2022, complete claim.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy is in approximate balance. Therefore, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to an effective date of January 31, 2022, but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
