REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine pain condition is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1976 to September 1979.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in November 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the October 22, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for a cervical spine pain condition, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Additionally, in a November 14, 2024, Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative requested the curriculum vitae and other information about the qualifications of medical examiner L.H. PA-C who conducted an examination on December 4, 2023.  The representative implied the examination was conducted for the Veteran's cervical spine disability; however, the Veteran's cervical spine examination was conducted on September 22, 2023, by M.W. and the referenced December 4, 2023, examination was conducted to evaluate a lumbar spine disability.  There is no further action that needs to be taken regarding this matter within the context of the present appeal.

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine pain condition is remanded.

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 C.F.R. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Here, the Veteran contends that he has cervical spine pain due to a vehicle accident while in service.  See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) document the following:  An August 15, 1977, STR notes "Presents [with] sharp pain L cervical area x last night"; and a July 12, 1978, STR notes the Veteran's report "19 y/o WM who was injured in motorcycle accident."  Additionally, on examination in September 2023, the Veteran was diagnosed with cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy.  Thus, the remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the documented in-service complaints and his currently diagnosed disability.

The Board finds remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The AOJ obtained the September 2023 medical opinion prior to the November 2023 rating decision on appeal; however, the opinion is not adequate for the reasons noted below.

In a September 2023 VA examination report, the examiner provided a negative nexus opinion for the Veteran's claimed cervical spine pain.  As rationale, the examiner stated "there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of Cervical Disk herniation and military service. Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology."  The Board finds the opinion inadequate to the extent that it relied on the absence of medical treatment since service and failed to consider the Veteran's report of "chronic pain since accident."  See Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (a medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history).  Additionally, the opinion is speculative where the examiner notes the Veteran's condition is more likely due to a post-service event, illness, or injury and failed to provide any rationale for this conclusion.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (indicating that most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning).  

Thus, given that the September 2023 nexus opinion failed to provide adequate rationale, the Board finds remand is necessary to address these deficiencies.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (indicating that if VA provides an examination, that examination must be adequate).  The AOJ's reliance on this opinion constitutes a duty to assist error that must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the etiology of the Veteran's claimed cervical spine pain condition.  The clinician must address the following question:

(a) Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's cervical spine disability (diagnosed as cervical disc herniation with radiculopathy) had onset in service or is otherwise related to his service.

The examiner should consider the following records: an August 15, 1977, STR noting "Presents [with] sharp pain L cervical area x last night"; a July 12, 1978, STR noting the Veteran's report "19 y/o WM who was injured in motorcycle accident"; and an August 28, 1978, STR noting complaints of dull pain on the right backside of the skull.

The clinician is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.

Note that a lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  Additionally, the clinician must not rely solely on the absence of an in-service finding or diagnosis as the basis for a negative

opinion.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered in making the determination.
