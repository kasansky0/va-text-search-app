ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of March 13, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

From March 13, 2019, entitlement to an initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted, subject to the laws and regulations governing the award of monetary benefits.

From March 13, 2019, entitlement to a compensable rating for sinusitis is denied.

Entitlement to a 10 percent rating based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.324, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. On March 13, 2019, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File a claim for compensation after the benefit sought of entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose, and this was followed within a year by a completed claim.

2. From March 13, 2019, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and impairment more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas but not total occupational and social impairment.

3. From March 13, 2019, the Veteran's sinusitis has not more nearly approximated one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.

4. The Veteran has been in receipt of at least a compensable rating from March 13, 2019, the date VA received his VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of March 13, 2019, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.155, 3.400.

3. From March 13, 2019, the criteria for entitlement to a compensable rating for sinusitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.20, 4.21, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

4. From March 13, 2019 (the entire period on appeal), there is no legal entitlement to a 10 percent rating for multiple noncompensable service connected disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 3.324.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service in the United States Navy from December 1990 to April 1991.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an appeal of an April 15, 2022, rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In the rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied an effective date prior to August 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for PTSD.  The AOJ also denied a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD and continued a noncompensable rating for sinusitis.  Lastly, the AOJ continued denial of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a 10 percent rating based on multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.324.  These claims were decided pursuant to a March 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request - Higher Level Review (HLR).  Consequently, the evidentiary window for the Veteran's claims closed with a prior rating decision of October 2021.

In his February 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decisions, as qualified above, on appeal.

The Veteran timely appealed the effective date assigned when service connection was granted for PTSD, so there is no issue as to a freestanding earlier effective date.  Cf. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (VA claimants may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date in an attempt to overcome the finality of an unappealed VA decision); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, n. 4 (2024) ("Whether Rudd and Leonard apply in the AMA system when a supplemental claim is filed more than 1 year after the last prior adjudication, which the Secretary asserts is analogous to a legacy system claim to reopen, Secretary's Supplemental Br. at 2, is beyond the scope of this decision").  

The Veteran's representative argued in an attachment to the VA Form 10182 that VA had made a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a prior adjudication in a writing associated with the afore-noted February 2023 VA Form 10182.  It is well established that the Board cannot adjudicate allegations of CUE in decisions of the AOJ in the first instance. Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).  Moreover, a claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date is not inextricably intertwined with a CUE motion.  While both are methods by which a veteran may obtain an earlier effective date, they are separate processes, each with distinct requirements for entitlement. See Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997) (noting that a CUE motion and earlier effective date claim are not the same because while the effective-date element flows directly from the award of service connection, an assertion of CUE may be brought at any time and is premised upon an error in a prior final regional office adjudication). The Court stated in Phillips that "[w]hile a veteran may certainly seek an earlier effective date through a subsequent adjudication of a reopened claim while simultaneously pursuing a CUE claim, those issues are not inextricably related."  Id. at 33.

In addition, the Veteran's representative referenced entitlement to a total disability rating based upon unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) in the same writing appended to the VA Form 10182.  The representative referenced general TDIU principles including that it must be addressed whenever raised by the record pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App, 447, 450-51 (2009).  As of the rendering of this decision, the Veteran has not been granted a TDIU, nor has the Veteran filed a formal claim for this benefit.  However, the Board must consider whether entitlement to a TDIU was raised in connection with the claims for service connection for PTSD and sinusitis, particularly where service connection has been granted and the initial ratings timely appealed.  Phillips v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 394, 396 (2024) ("TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability"). See also Garcia v. McDonough, No. 23-6158, 2024 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1257 (Aug. 13, 2024) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) ("in Phillips, we doubled down on the central holding of Rice: TDIU is not a separate claim, it is a rating option available whenever a claimant attempts to get service connection or a higher rating from VA and the record includes evidence of unemployability) (emphasis added); Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  TDIU must be considered from the effective date of the grant of service connection.  See Harper v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 356, 361-62 (2018) (the Veteran's notice of disagreement with the initial rating assigned in connection with the grant of service connection, combined with evidence of unemployability, resulted in the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from the effective date of the grant of service connection being on appeal).

For the following reasons, the Board finds that TDIU was not raised as part and parcel of the claims for higher initial ratings for PTSD and sinusitis.  While October 2021 sinusitis examination report reflected that the Veteran has experience non-incapacitating episodes of sinusitis, described as maxillary and sinus pressure with tooth sensitivity, after a fulsome evaluation, the VA clinician indicated that the Veteran's sinus, nose, throat, larynx or pharynx disability ("sinusitis") did not functionally impact his ability to work in any way.  The VA psychologist who conducted the September 2021 PTSD examination reported that the Veteran has been working as a process operator in a refinery and has maintained this position since his discharge from service.  While the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology was productive of occupational and social impairment, the psychologist did not find that the symptoms or impairment precluded gainful employment in light of the Veteran's college education and functional impact and the evidence does not otherwise indicate that the PTSD by itself or combined with the other service connected disabilities precludes or tends to preclude substantially gainful employment.  Therefore, the Board finds that entitlement to a TDIU was not raised as part of the Veteran's claims for higher initial ratings before the Board in the instant decision.

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to August 16, 2021, for the award of service connection for PTSD.

Generally, the effective date for a grant of service connection on an original claim is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Effective March 24, 2015, if an "intent to file" is filed followed by a completed formal claim within a year, the effective date is the date of the intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). 

On March 13, 2019, VA received an VA Form 21-0996 ("Intent to File").  On May 19, 2019, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ from the Veteran, which included a claim for compensation for PTSD.  On July 24, 2019, VA sent correspondence to the Veteran, which conveyed, in pertinent part that,

We received mail indicating that you would like us to review a claim that we previously denied for PTSD and (sinus congestion) Sinusitis. VA regulations require you to file this request on the proper form.

With specificity, the correspondence lays out the specific VA Form that the Veteran would need to file.

A review of the evidence of record reflects that the VA received VA Form 20-0995 ("Supplemental Claim Application"), one of the specific VA Forms stipulated in the July 24, 2019, VA correspondence, on August 16, 2021.

Thus, for the reasons above, the Veteran did initiate his claim for service connection on March 13, 2019, with his Intent to File and this was followed by a completed claim within a year, stablishing March 13, 2019 as the date of claim.  The Board again notes the CUE allegation by the Veteran's representative in the attachment to the February 2023 VA Form 10182 as to a November 1992 VA Form 21-526 that was denied in a rating decision of March 1993, which was not appealed and became final in November 1993 and encourages the representative to follow the procedures laid out above to file any CUE motion given that the issue has not been adjudicated by the AOJ and therefore cannot be addressed by the Board. 

Turning to when entitlement to the benefit arose in this matter, the Veteran failed to report to a VA PTSD examination that was scheduled in May 1997.  The evidence of record does not reflect a formal DSM-5 diagnosis of PTSD until September 2021.  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 404 (2020), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (a valid DSM-5 diagnosis is required to warrant compensation for a psychiatric disability).  However, the date entitlement arose is not necessarily the date of a diagnosis, but rather all of the evidence must be reviewed to determine when the disease entity first manifested even if not diagnosed until many years later. McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000) (in determining the date entitlement arose, when an original claim for benefits is pending, the Board must determine when a claimant's disability manifested itself under all the "facts found" and "the date on which the evidence is submitted is irrelevant").  A review of the Veteran's private treatment records from Dr. M reflect on-going complaints and treatment for depression from February 1, 2010. Indeed, the evidence discloses that the Veteran has endorsed depression and ineluctably bound to his PTSD.  Therefore, upon consideration of this evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to the benefit sought in this service connection claim arose prior to the date of claim.  Cf. Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (while service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition, "lay testimony could support a retrospective medical diagnosis of pre-existing PTSD").

As entitlement arose prior to the date of claim, the March 13, 2019 date of claim is the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

There is no evidence or argument that an intent to file or informal claim for service connection for these disabilities was filed prior to March 13, 2019, other than the reference to CUE that cannot be addressed by the Board in the absence of an AOJ decision denying CUE, and the evidence is thus neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether an earlier effective date is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against an effective date earlier than March 13, 2019, for the award of service connection for PTSD.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), is therefore not for application in this regard.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Higher Initial Rating For PTSD

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  

Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007).  Here, as explained below, the uniform ratings are proper.

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition.  The medical as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The schedular criteria for rating psychiatric disabilities incorporate the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.125, 4.130.  

The AOJ has rated the Veteran's PTSD under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411, which applies the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  The Veteran has been assigned a 50 percent rating (as of this decision effective from March 13, 2019).

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders per 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, a 50 percent disability rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent disability rating is warranted when there is occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent disability rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

Under the General Rating Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher rating.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F. 3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The symptoms under the rating criteria are meant to be examples of symptoms that would warrant the rating, but are not meant to be exhaustive, and the Board need not find all or even some of the symptoms to award a specific rating.  On the other hand, if the evidence shows that the Veteran suffers symptoms or effects that cause occupational or social impairment equivalent to what would be caused by the symptoms listed in the Diagnostic Code, the appropriate equivalent rating will be assigned.  Sellers v. Principi, 372 F. 3d 1318, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).

With regard to suicidal ideation in particular, the language of the general rating formula indicates that the presence of suicidal ideation alone, that is, a veteran's thoughts of his own death or thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behavior, may cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 20 (2017).

In multiple lay accounts, the Veteran conveyed that after service he has experienced difficulty understanding his own emotions, has gone through a divorce after 15 years of marriage, has found it difficult to communicate with others, and has struggled maintaining focus.

Dr. M's records disclose assessment of on-going depression throughout the appellate period.

In July 2021, the Veteran submitted a checklist in which he self-reported symptoms of anger, anxiety, chronic sleep problems, depression, difficulty making decisions, emotional numbing, guilt, inability to make and keep friends, lack of self-esteem, memory loss, neglect of personal hygiene, and neglect of family, problems with communication, problems at work, sense of helplessness, and an inability to share feelings.

In September 2021, the Veteran reported for an initial VA PTSD examination.  A VA psychologist reviewed the record; considered the Veteran's lay account of his psycho-medical history; and conducted a psychometric evaluation, in accord with DSM standards.  The psychologist rendered a diagnosis of PTSD.  The psychologist provided that the Veteran's PTSD was productive of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, al-though generally functioning satisfactorily, with normal routine behavior, self-care and conversation.  Symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  As to other complications, the Veteran engaged in avoidance behaviors, suffered from recurrent memories and dreams, remained hypervigilant, exhibited exaggerated startle response, experienced problems with concentration.  In remarks, the psychologist mentioned that the Veteran presented with depressed mood, anxiety, mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, disturbances of motivation and mood and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationship.  There was no evidence of suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan.

For the following reasons, the symptoms and impairment of the Veteran's service-connected PTSD more nearly approximate the criteria required for a 70 percent initial rating from March 13, 2019.

Throughout the entire appeal period, the Veteran has endorsed, and the VA psychologist of record have reported, depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  The Veteran's depression and insomnia have been arduous, impacting all aspects of his life.  While the VA psychologist indicated difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, the Veteran has also reported that he is emotionally detached from both his social and occupational spheres.  Anxiety and stress moreover extend to other people around him.  While the VA psychologist reported the majority of the Veteran's discernable endorsed everyday symptoms, the ubiquity of these symptoms was not addressed with the degree of severity that the Veteran has reported.  

The Veteran's depression impacts all aspects of his life.  Although deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms, has not been noted upon examinations, the question of the level of impairment caused by the psychiatric symptoms is an adjudicatory rather than a medical one.  38 C.F.R. § 3.100(a) (delegating the Secretary's authority "to make findings and decisions... as to the entitlement of claimants to benefits" to, inter alia, VA "adjudicative personnel"); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2 ("It is the responsibility of the rating specialist to interpret reports of examination... so that the current rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present").

Based upon the above, the Veteran symptoms and impairment attributable to PTSD more nearly approximate occupational and social impairment in most areas.  An initial 70 percent rating is therefore warranted.  

A higher, 100 percent rating is not, however, warranted.  The Veteran has maintained full-time employment since separation from service.  Moreover, the Veteran indicated that he has maintained good relationships with his family.  Thus, the Veteran's symptoms and impairment do not more nearly approximate total occupational and social impairment.  In this regard, there is no heightened requirement for a 100 percent rating under the general rating formula for mental disorders; the standard of 38 C.F.R. § 4.7, that the symptoms and impairment more nearly approximate the total occupational and social impairment for this rating, applies.  See Del Valle v. Gober, No. 96-1116, 1997 U.S. Vet. App. LEXIS 960 (Oct. 1, 1997) (mem dec) (Holdaway, J.) (citing Giusti-Bravo v. United States Veterans Administration, 853 F. Supp. 34 (D.P.R. 1993) (discussing VA's San Juan Memorandum 82-3 which incorrectly advised rating board specialists to use heightened requirements for veterans seeking 100 percent disability ratings for psychiatric disorders).  See also Bethea v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).  Here, however, the above evidence reflects that the symptoms and impairment from the Veteran's PTSD do not more nearly approximate the total occupational and social impairment required for a 100 percent rating.

Significantly, there is a lack of evidence that shows that the Veteran's PTSD symptomatology suddenly worsened on the day which the September 2021 VA initial PTSD examination occurred.  An effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a particular treatment record or examination report.  Estevez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 157, 175 (2023) ("As we have said before, the Board errs when it reflexively assigns the date of a VA examination as the date of an increased evaluation; instead, the Board must analyze the examination report alongside the other lay and medical evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability actually occurred") (citing Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224-25 (2015) (rejecting the mechanical assignment of an effective date based on the date of examination and explaining that, for staged evaluation purposes, VA must examine all relevant facts to determine when an increase in a veteran's disability manifests); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011) ("[A]n effective date should not be assigned mechanically based on the date of a diagnosis. Rather, all of the facts should be examined to determine the date that [a disability] first manifested")).

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is evenly balanced as to whether an initial 70 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's PTSD from March 13, 2019.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore for application in this regard.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3; Lynch, 21 F. 4th at 781-82.

Sinusitis

The AOJ has assigned the Veteran a noncompensable rating.  As is the case above, this too is a claim for a higher initial rating.  The Veteran's sinusitis is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513. Sinusitis is rated according to the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis (General Rating Formula).

Under the General Rating Formula, the following ratings apply: a noncompensable (0 percent) rating is warranted for sinusitis detected by x-ray only; a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting; a 30 percent rating is warranted for three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for chronic sinusitis following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or; near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of the affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

A note accompanying Diagnostic Code 6513 states that an incapacitating episode is defined as one requiring bed rest and treatment by a physician

Considering the pertinent evidence in light of the applicable rating criteria and considerations, the Board finds, for the following reasons, that the evidence is not approximately balanced as to whether a higher, 10 percent rating, for sinusitis is warranted for the period under consideration (sinusitis was included in the Veteran's March 13, 2019, Intent to File).

In March 2021, the Veteran reported for a VA sinusitis examination.  The clinician rendered a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis.  The Veteran reported that she has frequent sinus infections, and the symptoms have not improved over time.  On-going symptoms include maxillary and sinus pressure and PND with tooth sensitivity.  Symptoms, according to the clinician, manifest in the frontal and maxillary regions.  While there are episodes of sinusitis, no episode is incapacitating.  There was no evidence of surgery of rhinitis.  The larynx and pharynx were asymptomatic.  The vocal cords were not impacted and there was no evidence of a deviated septum.  Additionally, there were no neoplasms.  Imaging was not performed.  The clinician indicated that sinusitis did not functionally impact the Veteran's ability to work.

As noted above, to receive a compensable (10 percent) rating, there would need to be a showing of one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.

The above evidence reflects that the Veteran has not experienced any incapacitating episodes.  As noted in the October 2021, the Veteran's experiences episodic bouts of sinusitis, no bout has been incapacitating.  Additionally, there is not affirmative evidence that discloses that the Veteran requires antibiotic treatment.  And, lastly, the findings upon examination did not reveal sinusitis symptomatology approximating headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting from which it could be determined that there were non-incapacitating episodes.  The symptoms, as reported above, consist of maxillary and sinus pressure and PND with tooth sensitivity. 

Finally in this regard, as sinusitis is specifically referenced in the Rating Schedule, rating by analogy is not appropriate.  Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) ("[W]hen a condition is specifically listed in the Schedule, it may not be rated by analogy").

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether an initial compensable rating is warranted for the Veteran's sinusitis.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against such a rating, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application in this regard.  Lynch, 21 F. 4th 776, 781-82 

The Board has considered the Veteran's claims and decided entitlement based on the evidence.? Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  Doucette v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?366, 369-70?(2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence?of?record.

Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation based upon multiple, noncompensable, service-connected disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 are predicated on the existence solely of multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities. Once a compensable rating for any service-connected disability has been awarded, the applicability of 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 is rendered moot.  See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 541 (1993). 

From March 13, 2019, the initial date of the Veteran's intent to file claims for service connection, the Veteran (as of the rendering of this decision) is in receipt of a 70 percent rating.  At no point during the period on appeal did the Veteran meet the threshold criteria of multiple noncompensable service-connected disabilities.  Therefore, the Veteran's claim for compensation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.324 must be denied.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
