ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left knee scar is denied under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802 prior to August 7, 2019.

An initial 20 percent rating is granted under DC 7804 for left knee scar from August 7, 2019.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for a left knee meniscal tear under DC 5259-5260 is denied.

Effective July 7, 2019, entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability under DC 5257 is granted.

Effective November 12, 2014, entitlement to a separate 20 percent rating for dislocated left knee semilunar cartilage under DC 5258 is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The competent and credible evidence of record persuasively establishes a finding that the Veteran's left knee scar was not covering at least 144 square inches or more, unstable, or painful prior to August 7, 2019. The evidence is not in approximate balance.

2. The evidence is in approximate balance to find that Veteran's affidavit signed on August 7, 2019 shows his left knee scar had become painful and unstable.

3. The Veteran's left knee meniscal tear is in receipt of the highest possible rating under DC 5259; his flexion was limited to no more than 115 degrees.

4. Since July 7, 2019, the Veteran's left knee instability was manifested by no more than slight instability. 

5. Since November 12, 2014, the Veteran's dislocated left knee semilunar cartilage resulted in frequent pain, locking, and effusion. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Prior to August 7, 2019, the criteria for an initial compensable disability rating for a left knee scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

2. From August 7, 2019, the criteria for an initial 20 percent disability rating, but no higher, for a left knee scar are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a left knee meniscal tear have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5259-5260.

4. Effective July 7, 2019, the criteria for a separate 10 percent rating, but no higher, for left knee instability are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5257.

5. Effective November 12, 2014, the criteria for a separate 20 percent rating, but no higher, for left knee meniscal tear dislocation are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5257.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1992 to June 1996. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that granted service connection for a left knee meniscal tear as 10 percent disabling and a left knee scar as noncompensable, both effective November 12, 2014. 

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the August 7, 2020 VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, in this case, November 5, 2020, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that in his August 2020 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran attempted to appeal the issue of entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability and a bilateral foot disability. He claimed these disabilities were secondary to his left knee meniscal tear under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. No additional argument was made. There were no rating decisions concerning the right knee or a bilateral foot disability issued within 1 year prior to the August 2020 notice of disagreement. Therefore, these issues are not on appeal before the Board today. Further, the Veteran later separately filed a claim seeking service connection for a right knee disability which was granted in a February 2022 rating decision. The Veteran is encouraged to file a claim seeking service connection for a bilateral foot disability if he wishes to do so.  

Neither the Veteran nor representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist. See Scott v McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board...to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty to assist argument).

In the Legacy system when the issue of service connection for left knee disability was being adjudicated, the Veteran was sent a VA form 21-4142a for general release for medication provider information to the VA in November 2019. No written response was provided by the Veteran and a December 2019 report of general information showed he called informing VA there was nothing more to submit. As the Veteran did not return the November 2019 VA Form 21-4142a and indicated there were no additional records to obtain, there has been substantial compliance with the June 2019 Board remand directives that requested this development. See Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141 (1999); D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 105 (2008); Wanless v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 143, 151 (2009).  The Board finds no pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors related to obtaining private treatment records.

Increased Rating

A disability rating is determined by applying VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the Veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and coordination of rating with impairment of function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the Veteran, as well as the entire history of her disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for residuals of left knee scar.

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his left knee scar. The Veteran has continuously pursued his left knee claim since filing in November 2014. Therefore, the period on appeal begins with the November 12, 2014 claim seeking service connection for a left knee disability. 

The Veteran's left knee scar is rated under Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018. These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the AOJ on or after August 13, 2018. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the veteran will be applied. The Board may not apply a current regulation prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, the Board is not precluded from applying prior versions of the applicable regulation to the period on or after the effective dates of the new regulation if the prior version was in effect during the pendency of the appeal.

Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802, was for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that were superficial and nonlinear. Under these criteria, a scar with an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Note 1 to Diagnostic Code 7802 instructed that a superficial scar was one not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Id. 

Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Diagnostic Code 7802 was otherwise unchanged by the August 13, 2018, amendments.

The Veteran's available private treatment records from November 2014 show treatment for the left knee but no reports of symptoms specific to his scar. During the April 2015 VA examination, a left knee scar was noted but no measurements were provided. However, the scar was not painful, unstable, or covering an area equal to at least 39 square cm. No scars of the head, face, or neck were indicated. 

In a May 2015 statement from the Veteran, he asserted knee pain, but no symptoms related to his scar. 

The Veteran submitted several affidavits in August 2020 with his notice of disagreement. Regarding his left knee scar, an affidavit dated in August 2019 shows reports of pain and aching. He also asserted his body movements cause his scar to "uncover/peel and open." He then asserted his scar was unstable which causes pain, aching, itching, and redness/inflammation. It peels, drains blood and pus, and heals but will uncover again. He contends his scar has worsened during the period on appeal. 

However, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for his knees in January 2020. During that examination, the Veteran made no reports of left knee scar symptoms. The examiner noted a left knee scar measuring 1.2cm long and .2cm wide. The January 2020 VA examiner specifically continued to find the scar was not painful, unstable, or covering an area equal to at least 39 square cm. No scars of the head, face, or neck were indicated.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's left knee scar is not manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7801, was for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are deep and nonlinear. Since August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7801 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. However, the criteria have remained unchanged. Diagnostic Code 7800, 7804, and 7805 were not changed by the August 13, 2018, amendments. 

The competent and credible evidence of record shows the Veteran's left knee scar is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and non-linear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7801, both prior to and from August 13, 2018, are inapplicable. 

Under DC 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful. Note 1 states "an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of the skin over the scar." If a scar is both stable and painful, an additional 10 percent is to be added for each scar.

In the Veteran's August 2019 affidavit, he reported significant left knee scar symptoms to of pain and being unstable. The Board acknowledges this statement was provided under oath and that the Veteran is competent to report on the observable aspects of his left knee scar. However, in assessing credibility, the Board may consider many factors including statements made during treatment, self-interest or bias, internal consistency, and consistency with other evidence. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 512 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (per curiam); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341, 345 (1999); Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1480-81 (1997). 

In this case, the Veteran did not report any left knee scar symptoms to his private provider. No left knee scar symptoms were reported in the April 2015 VA examination. That examiner specifically found the scar was not painful or unstable. The Veteran made reports of significant symptoms in August 2019 asserting his left knee scar had worsened and provided a list of symptoms specific to the scar. However, on examination in January 2020, only 5 months later, the examiner found the left knee scar was not unstable or painful.

Considering the above, the competent and credible evidence of records persuasively weighs in favor of finding the Veteran's left knee scar was not painful or unstable prior to August 7, 2019.

However, the affidavit is sworn testimony and it is reasonable to accept that the scar could have changed between 2015 and 2019.

It is unclear whether the January 2020 examiner's indication that the scar was not unstable or painful was based on his own examination or on the Veteran's reports.

Regardless, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance for and against a finding that the scar was painful and unstable from August 7, 2019. Resolving doubt in the Veteran's favor, a 20 percent rating is warranted for his single painful and unstable scar from that date under DC 7804.

Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated under both pre- and post-August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7805. The evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of finding no remaining symptoms that are not contemplated by his noncompensable rating under DC 7802 and staged rating under DC 7804.

In finding so, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions of a worsening of his left knee scar symptoms in his affidavit. Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). In this case, the only evidence of worsening found in the record - the August 2019 affidavit - was associated with the claims file after the issuance of the June 2020 rating decision on appeal notice, during the second evidentiary window under the Evidence docket. Therefore, there is no duty to assist error in declining to provide an up-to-date examination of the left knee scar. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to a compensable rating for a left knee scar is warranted under DC 7802. Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding his left knee scar was 144 square inches or greater, with underlying soft tissue damage. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application when the evidence is persuasively for or against the claim). 

A 20 percent rating is granted under DC 7804 for one unstable and painful scar, effective August 7, 2019.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for left knee meniscal tear.

3. Entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability.

4. Entitlement to a separate 20 percent rating for dislocated left knee semilunar cartilage. 

The Veteran seeks an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for his left knee meniscal tear. As stated above, the period on appeal begins with his November 2014 date of claim. 

The Veteran was granted a 10 percent disability rating under DC 5259-5260 based on painful motion of the knee and symptomatic residuals of semilunar cartilage removal in a May 2018 rating decision. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Under Diagnostic Code 5259, a 10 percent rating is warranted for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5259. However, as the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating for dislocation of symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage, there is no basis to award a higher evaluation. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5259 is not warranted. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

Pyramiding, that is the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different DCs, is to be avoided when evaluating a veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, it is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several DCs; the critical element in permitting the assignment of several evaluations under various DCs is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

As relevant to the knees, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that evaluating a knee disability under DCs 5257 and 5261 (and implicitly DC 5260), either together or separately, does not preclude separate evaluation of a meniscal disability of the same knee under DC 5258 or 5259, and vice versa. See Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017). More recently, the Court held that the rule against pyramiding does not categorically preclude a separate rating under DC 5257 for lateral instability simply because a claimant is also receiving a rating under DC 5259. See Walleman v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 294 (2022). In other words, the rule against pyramiding does not categorically preclude assigning a separate disability rating under the pre-amended version of DC 5257 for lateral instability when a claimant is already rated under DC 5259 for residuals of a meniscectomy if there are symptomatic residuals of a meniscectomy other than instability that could independently warrant a compensable rating under DC 5259. Id. at 306-07.

Evidence

Private medical records from November 2014 show the Veteran reported left knee pain that burns and aches. He reported his right knee swells frequently and will buckle. He sometimes has stiffness when he sits for any length of time and will occasionally pop. He denied any locking of the left knee. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2015 for his knees. He reported left knee swelling, pain, and a burning sensation. He denied experiencing flare ups. However, the April 2015 VA examiner did not provide any range of motion measurements, ankylosis findings, or muscle strength results for the left knee. The Board acknowledges that the April 2015 VA examination is not adequate in this regard as it is missing several range of motion measurements and movement findings. However, the Veteran's prior November 2014 treatment record and May 2015 lay statement is sufficient for the Board to understand the severity of the Veteran's left knee meniscal tear at the time of the VA examination. Remand for an addendum retrospective opinion would delay this favorable outcome for the Veteran without confirmation such an opinion would provide more information 10 years later than the evidence of record at that time already does. 

The April 2015 VA examiner appeared to conduct joint stability testing bilaterally. No recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, or recurrent effusion was noted. Left knee stability testing showed no instability. There was no evidence of recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, or any other tibial/fibular impairment. The examiner did indicate the Veteran has a meniscal tear with frequent episodes of joint pain and a meniscectomy in 2002. The Veteran denied the use of an assistive device. 

Approximately 1 month later, in May 2015, the Veteran submitted a statement regarding his left knee. He was told his left knee is "bone to bone" and there is nothing more than can be done to help his pain. He reported daily issues such as locking and swelling. He stated he sought care in March 2015 where a provider observed both issues. He provided the same statement with his May 2016 VA Form 9. 

The Veteran underwent an additional VA examination in January 2020. Here, the Veteran reported constant left knee pain but denied flare ups. His left knee range of motion in flexion was limited to 115 degrees with no limitation of extension to 0 degrees. Range of motion itself contributed to functional loss as the Veteran could not fully bend his left knee. There was pain on flexion, with weight bearing, and with palpation of the joint. There was no additional loss in range of motion with repetitive use or with repeated use over time. The examiner reported less movement in the left knee due to ankylosis, adhesion, ect. and disturbances of locomotion. His muscle strength was 5/5 in the left knee on both flexion and extension. No muscle atrophy or left knee ankylosis was noted. This finding indicates the above reported disturbance of locomotion was not a result of ankylosis. Joint stability testing was normal with no history of recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, or recurrent effusion. There was no evidence of recurrent patellar dislocation, shin splints, stress fractures, chronic exertional compartment syndrome, or any other tibial/fibular impairment. The examiner noted a left side meniscal tear but did not provide any symptoms of the condition. The Veteran endorsed the regular use of an assistive device "for work." Regarding work, the examiner asserted the Veteran could not complete work that required extensive walking. He further endorsed left knee pain with weight bearing. 

The Veteran also submitted several affidavits in August 2020 from himself and other family members. An affidavit taken in August 2020 from the Veteran asserts his left knee disability has worsened, and his symptoms had multiplied. During the period on appeal he began to experience locking, tenderness, muscle pain, popping, extensive swelling, limited ability to flex and bend the knee, severe weakness, and limited movement. He has an inability to stand or move for short periods unless he rests. He continued to report a worsening of his left knee symptoms and an increase in flare ups. No additional information regarding the frequency, duration, or symptoms during a flare up was provided. He contends he is unable to bend, twist, climb stairs, or ride in a car for long periods. He has significant swelling, pain, soreness, and an inability to bear weight at times. He cannot extend his left knee fully, has instability while standing for long periods, and has stiffness and locking when sitting for long periods. He elevates his knee for temporary relief which does not help much. He asserts using orthopedic shoes, foot orthotics, knee pillows, liquid heat, pain pads, knee sleeves, shoe insoles, ice packs, heat packs, and compressive bandages to treat his knee. His condition has not improved. He asserts he informed his providers and the VA about his symptoms.

The Veteran also submitted a July 2019 affidavit regarding his bilateral knee symptoms. He made similar assertions as stated above but applying to both knees. He also reported the use of ibuprofen in addition to the above listed treatments. He asserts even using these treatments, his knee condition remains the same. Regarding flareups bilaterally, he contends he is unable to stand or walk and is confined to his house for weeks at a time. His flare ups last up to 6 weeks occurring several times throughout the year. 

The Board acknowledges that in Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims found that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria." In this case, the Veteran reported pain despite his medication use designed to prevent such a symptom. The persuasive weight of the record does not show the Veteran's medication use is helpful or reducing his symptoms. There are no beneficial medication effects to discount. See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798, Vet. App. March 12, 2025. 

An August 2019 affidavit from the Veteran's daughter states her father informed her his knee had worsened during the period on appeal. She witnessed him having difficulty sitting or standing for long periods, climbing stairs, and walking long distances. She has seen his knee "give out" when attempting to "walk long distances" or stand for "long periods of time." She has seen him elevate his knee for relief. She has also witnessed swelling, tenderness, stiffness, "visually displaying knots," aching, and pain. 

His wife made similar assertions in an August 2020 affidavit regarding an increase in symptoms. She witnessed the Veteran having locking, extreme tenderness, muscle pain, popping, extensive swelling, knot formation/tenderness in his left knee, a limited ability to flex/bend, severe weakness, an inability to flex/bend his knee, limited movement, and excruciating pain. He complains to her about feeling and experiencing an inability to stand or walk for short periods without taking breaks. She has witnessed an increase of flare ups which last longer and are more frequent. No additional information regarding flare ups was provided. She has seen his inability to bend, twist, climb stairs, or ride in the car for long periods. He has swelling, an inability to bear weight, soreness, knots, and tenderness. She has also witnessed the Veteran's inability to fully extend his knee, instability standing or walking for long periods, difficulty "deep bending his left knee," pain, tenderness, stiffness, locking, limited movement to include flexibility, and limping. He cannot sit for long periods has his knee becomes stiff, will lock, and swell. The Veteran will elevate his knee for some relief. She also provided the same recount of assistive devices as asserted by the Veteran. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's August 2020 assertion that his left knee has worsened during the course of his appeal. Remand by the Board in the AMA is proper for the correction of (1) duty to assist errors occurring prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal (i.e., pre-decisional duty to assist errors) and (2) AOJ errors in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). In this case, neither the Veteran nor the evidence of record indicated a worsening of his left knee disability prior to the June 2020 rating decision on appeal. Therefore, remand for an additional VA examination is not warranted. 

As stated above, a rating in excess of 10 percent for the left knee under DC 5259 is not warranted. Likewise, a rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5260 is not warranted as the Veteran's left knee flexion was limited to, at worst, 115 degrees. Even considering the Veteran's reports of pain and limitation of motion, the evidence of record does not support a finding that his left knee flexion more closely approximates flexion limited to 30 degrees. A rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted under DC 5260.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

The Board finds the Veteran's left knee symptoms warrant two additional separate ratings. 

First, under Diagnostic Code 5257, a 10 percent rating is warranted for slight recurrent subluxation or lateral instability. A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability. A 30 percent rating is warranted for severe recurrent subluxation or lateral instability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

According to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "slight" means small in amount. "Moderate" means tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree.

Objective medical evidence is not required to establish lateral knee instability under Diagnostic Code 5257, so objective medical evidence cannot be categorically found more probative than lay evidence with respect to this Diagnostic Code. See English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 352-53 (2018).

The Veteran first reported issues with his knee buckling in November 2014. However, the April 2015 VA examiner found stability testing was normal and the Veteran did not report issues with instability at that time. He also denied the use of an assistive device. No statements regarding instability were made in his May 2015 statement describing other knee symptoms such as locking and swelling. During the January 2020 VA examination, joint stability was again found to be normal and the Veteran did not assert issues with instability. The Veteran reported the regular use of a knee brace "every day for work."

In contrast, the August 2020 affidavit from the Veteran asserts his left knee condition had worsened, and his symptoms had multiplied. Regarding instability, he reported "severe weakness" and instability when standing for long periods. The Veteran submitted a July 2019 affidavit regarding his bilateral knee symptoms that described issues walking for long periods and issues with limping but were not attributed to instability. The July 2019 affidavit does not assert issues with instability in either knee but specifically, none was asserted in the left knee. He endorsed the use of assistive devices such as knee sleeves and orthopedic inserts but did not assert their use was to aid in stabilizing his left knee. An august 2019 affidavit from the Veteran's daughter discussed the combined symptoms of his bilateral knee disabilities. No assertions were made specifically regarding the left knee. However, she did report seeing the Veteran's knees "give out" when he attempted to walk long distances or stand for long periods of time. The Veteran's wife also stated she witnessed the Veteran having instability when standing for long period or walking long distances. 

The Veteran made one report of buckling in November 2014. However, the Veteran did not report any additional issued with buckling to the April 2015 VA examiner, in his May 2015 lay statement describing left knee symptoms, or to the January 2020 VA examiner. Additionally, stability testing in April 2015 and January 2020 were normal with no instability of the left knee found. In contrast, in an August 7, 2019 affidavit from the Veteran's daughter, she asserted seeing instability when the Veteran stands or walks for long periods. The Veteran and his wife continued to report issues with instability of the left knee in their August 2020 affidavits. 

The Veteran's instability appears to occur when the Veteran stands or walks for long periods. The Veteran did not report falls, an inability to walk due specifically to instability, as opposed to pain, and he did not report the use of an assistive device for instability. Rather, instability only occurs with prolonged use of the left knee. His symptoms equate to instability that is small in amount as it occurs only with prolonged use. In contrast, his reported instability is not happening on a consistent enough basis to warrant a finding it is an average occurrence. Based on the above, entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability is warranted. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran first reported buckling in November 2014. However, this appears to have been a singular assertion of buckling with no additional instability issues reported until August 17, 2019. Additionally, when considering the evidence as discussed above, the Veteran's report of worsening further demonstrates his instability developed later rather than being present since filing in November 2014. As such, entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for instability is warranted effective August 7, 2019 as this is the first ascertainable increase in disability found in the record to warrant such a rating. 

The Veteran is also entitled to a separate rating under DC 5258. A 20 percent rating is warranted for dislocation of the semilunar cartilage with frequent episodes of "locking," pain, and effusion into the joint. "Frequent" may be defined as acting or returning regularly or often. See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frequent.

The Veteran reported stiffness, pain, and swelling in his left knee in November 2014 but denied locking of the joint. He continued to report pain and swelling at the April 2015 VA examination. The examiner diagnosed him with a left knee meniscal tear but only attributed pain to his meniscal condition. However, in a May 2015 statement he continued to endorse pain, swelling, and locking in his knee. 

The July 2019 affidavit from his daughter asserted she witnessed his knees being swollen, tender to the touch, and stiff. She also witnessed her father in pain. The January 2020 VA examiner did not capture many reports of the Veteran's left knee symptoms other than pain. The examiner confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of a left knee meniscal tear as instructed by the June 2019 Board remand directives. However, no locking or effusion was noted by the examiner. In contrast, the Veteran and his wife's August 2020 affidavits report issues with swelling, pain, stiffness, and locking. 

The Board acknowledges the April 2015 and January 2020 VA examiners did not find locking or effusion of the knee, only pain. However, the Veteran first reported these issues to a medical provider in November 2014. He continued to do so throughout the period on appeal. In May 2015 he reported daily issues with swelling and locking but in August 2020 asserted his symptoms had only worsened. His wife and daughter also reported observing similar symptoms. They occurred with enough regularity that both of them noticed and were able to report it in their affidavits. This indicates his symptoms occur regularly and may be considered "frequent." The Veteran, his wife, and his daughter are all competent to report on the observable aspects of his left knee meniscal tear to include reports of pain, swelling, stiffness, and locking. Their reports are both internally consistent and consistent with the other evidence of record. As such, their assertions showing a long history of left knee pain, locking, and swelling, or effusion, are found to be credible and afforded probative weight. As such, entitlement to a 20 percent rating for dislocation of the left knee semilunar cartilage under DC 5258 is warranted.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran denied locking in November 2014. However, he did endorse stiffness at that time and began reporting "locking" by name only a few months later. When considering the evidentiary record as a whole, it is likely the Veteran had been experiencing some form of locking in the left knee since filing his claim in November 2014. Thus, the Board resolves doubt in favor of the Veteran. Entitlement to a separate 20 percent rating for dislocation of the left knee semilunar cartilage under DC 5258 is warranted effective November 12, 2014. 

In doing so, the Board will not discontinue the Veteran's current 10 percent rating under DC 5259 for symptomatic removal of the semilunar cartilage. The Veteran's 20 percent rating under DC 5258 now only compensates for the Veteran's locking, pain, and swelling. However, a separate 10 percent rating under DC 5259 is warranted to contemplate the Veteran's reports of burning, tenderness, popping, soreness, or issues bearing weight. He has had at least one symptom other than pain, locking, swelling, and instability since filing his claim in November 2014. Removal of the separate 10 percent rating at any time during the period on appeal would leave the Veteran with symptoms otherwise not contemplated by only a 20 percent rating under DC 5258. The symptoms contemplated by DC 5258 and 5259 do not overlap. As such, there is no issue regarding pyramiding as no left knee symptom is being compensated for more than once. 

The Board has also considered if a rating under DC 5256 for ankylosis is warranted. The April 2015 and January 2020 VA examiners specifically found no ankylosis was present in the Veteran's left knee. The Board has considered whether the requirement of ankylosis can be met with evidence of the functional equivalent of ankylosis (i.e., functional immobility of the joint) during a flare-up. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). However, during this period neither the medical nor lay evidence shows an inability to move the left knee or its fixation to a single position during flare ups. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports that he is confined to his home during a flare up. However, this appears to be due to the combined effects of his knee symptoms during a flare up rather than due to the locking of his joint. Despite his limitations and reports of functional loss, the Veteran's disability picture does not more accurately reflect a finding of functional ankylosis in the left knee. Therefore, a rating under DC 5256 is not warranted. Additionally, the Veteran's left knee locking is currently contemplated by his 20 percent rating under DC 5258. An additional rating for this symptom would result in pyramiding and is therefore prohibited. 

Likewise, a rating under DC 5261 is not warranted as the Veteran's left knee extension was normal with full extension to zero during both the April 2016 and January 2020 VA examinations. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's daughter and wife indicated observing the Veteran having difficulty extending his knee. However, the reports do not indicate at what point the Veteran begins having issues with extension. The only measurements of record indicate he was able to fully extend his left knee in January 2020. Therefore, the Veteran's left knee symptoms do not more closely approximate that of extension limited to 5 degrees or more. 

As no issues regarding his tibia or fibula were found, a rating under DC 5262 is not warranted. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions regarding issues with weight bearing but as no Genu recurvatum was found, a rating under 5263 is not warranted. 

Finally, the Board acknowledges the Veteran and his family's reports of visible knots in the left knee. However, no muscle issues were identified by the April 2015 or January 2020 VA examiners. His available medical treatment records also do not show a diagnosis of a muscle disability relating to his service-connected left knee that would result in such knots. While the Veteran and his family are competent to report on the observable aspects of his left knee disability, they are not medically competent to provide a muscle diagnosis or link such a condition to his service-connected disabilities. An opinion of that nature requires medical expertise that is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson, and the Veteran does not have relevant medical training, experience, or education to make a diagnosis. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Additionally, the Veteran's pain, stiffness, and accompanying motor function issues are contemplated by his above ratings. As such, no separate rating is warranted for an impairment of the muscle as a result of his service-connected left knee meniscal tear, meniscal dislocation, or instability. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence is neither evenly nor approximately balanced as to whether entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5259-5260 is warranted. The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b), Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. 

However, entitlement to a separate 10 percent rating for left knee instability under DC 5257 effective July 7, 2019 is warranted. An additional separate 20 percent rating under DC 5258 for left knee semilunare cartilage dislocation effective November 12, 2014 is warranted. The claims are granted.
