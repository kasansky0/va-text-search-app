ORDER

The January 13, 2025, request for an extension of time to file an appeal from a rating decision issued on August 1, 2023 that denied service connection for neuropathy is denied, and the attempted appeal is therefore dismissed.   

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182) with respect to the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023 that denied service connection for neuropathy, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The January 13, 2025 Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023 that denied service connection for neuropathy, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 28, 1966 to September 1968. The Veteran filed a January 13, 2025 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023, and selecting the Direct Review docket. 

TIMELINESS OF AN APPEAL

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed NOD on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of an NOD shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing an NOD may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).

Timeliness of the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023.

On January 13, 2025, the Veteran filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023 that denied service connection for neuropathy. The Veteran asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal because he moved to a new address and his papers were misplaced during the move. See June 2024 Correspondence; January 2025 Correspondence.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023. 

The rating decision issued on August 1, 2023 denied service connection for neuropathy. The Veteran and the Veteran's representative were notified of the decision in an August 1, 2023, letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Veteran's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable. 

The Veteran's January 13, 2025 NOD was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023. 

The Veteran appointed a new representative on December 27, 2023. On June 18, 2024, within a year of the August 1, 2023, notification letter that informed the Veteran of the rating decision denying neuropathy, the Veteran submitted a buddy statement dated January 15, 2024, and treatment records from March 2024. In a June 18, 2024 statement, the Veteran asserted that "my papers were misplaced" after moving and that he had tried to track down his Vietnam platoon medic to obtain additional evidence and was unsuccessful, but he was able to find his squad leader, who wrote a letter in support of his claim. In his January 13, 2025 VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated that "[f]iling this Agent Orange claim this late is because of ignorance." 

The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file an appeal from the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023. The Veteran asserted that he misplaced his papers during a move to a new address, however, he does not assert that he did not receive notification, including the instructions on how to file an appeal to the Board, and his representative also received notification and instructions. Further, he asserted that his Board Appeal request was also untimely because he was attempting to obtain new evidence from fellow servicemembers. He submitted a statement from his platoon leader in June 2024, but unfortunately did not submit a VA Form 10182 Board Appeal request at the time. He later clarified that his January 2025 Board Appeal request was filed late because of ignorance. However, as noted above, the Veteran was notified of his right to file an appeal to the Board and provided instructions for how to file an appeal, which he could have done after appointing a new representative in December 2023, or when submitting the buddy statement in June 2024. Consequently, the Veteran's explanations do not establish that there is good cause for why his Board Appeal request was not timely filed, nor why it could not have been filed sooner than it was. 

Accordingly, the January 13, 2025 Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on August 1, 2023, that denied service connection for neuropathy, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension request is denied, and the attempted appeal is dismissed.
