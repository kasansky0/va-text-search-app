DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a current disability of OSA, and the evidence is at least in relative equipoise that it was incurred during his military service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for OSA are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1972 to August 1992.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 higher-level review rating decision.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service connection for OSA

Service connection will be granted if is shown that the Veteran suffers from a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a pre-existing injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty, during active military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The AOJ found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of OSA.  See January 2024 rating decision.  Absent clear and unmistakable error, this favorable finding is binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Given this favorable finding, the first element necessary to establish service connection is met.  The Veteran has a current disability of OSA.

The second element necessary to establish service connection is an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury.  The Veteran claims onset of OSA around 1985, while he was on active duty.  The Veteran identified onset coincident with snoring, which was observed by his wife.   June 2022 C&P exam (Sleep Apnea Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)).   

Additionally, the Veteran has provided a letter from his brigade surgeon during Desert Shield/Desert Storm who evaluated the Veteran for a suspected deviated septum because of his loud snoring in late 1990.  See November 2022 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility (MTR-NGF).  

Based on this persuasive evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran incurred an in-service injury or disease via the onset of sleep disturbance that included loud snoring.  The second element necessary to establish service connection is therefore met.

The third element necessary to establish service connection is that of a nexus between the claimed disability and the in-service injury or disease.  The flight surgeon mentioned above provided a positive medical nexus opinion.  He stated: "It is certainly within a reasonable amount of medical certainty that what he was experiencing, and was later diagnosed with, was Sleep Apnea.  I have reviewed the patient's old medical records and discussed this matter with him but have distinct memories of the event because of his desire to go to Mercy [a hospital ship] for evaluation."  See November 2022 MTR-NGF.  

The Veteran's lay evidence concerning the advent of his snoring is also relevant to the issue of nexus.  While the Veteran is not competent to render a medical opinion regarding etiology of his condition, he is competent to state when he first began experiencing symptoms and to describe them.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional."). 

Additionally, the Veteran has explained that he did not claim service connection for OSA immediately upon his retirement because he had been advised that it was pointless to do so without having had an in-service sleep study.  December 2022 Correspondence.  This entirely credible statement implicitly attests to continuity of symptomatology throughout the Veteran's military service and following his retirement.  

The Board acknowledges negative medical evidence concerning the issue of nexus.  However, the negative medical evidence is largely irrelevant because it generally addresses theories of secondary service connection.  See, e.g., May 2020 C&P exam (Medical Opinion DBQ); March 2021 C&P exam (Medical Opinion DBQ).  The Board's decision in this case is based on direct service connection.  

The positive opinion of the Veteran's flight surgeon in 1990 is both competent and persuasive.  The Veteran's lay evidence regarding nexus is relevant and probative.  In sum, the evidence at least in relative equipoise regarding whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's in-service injury or disease and his current diagnosis of OSA.  The final element necessary to establish service connection is therefore met.    

Entitlement to service connection for OSA is granted.
