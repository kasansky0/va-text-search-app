DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 6, 2018, and no earlier, for the grant of service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease is granted.

Prior to June 22, 2023, a compensable disability rating for irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease is denied.

From May 19, 2024, entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for irritable bowel syndrome is granted.

From June 22, 2023, entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease is denied.

Entitlement to separate ratings for irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal reflux disease is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed an initial claim seeking service connection for eosinophilic esophagitis on June 6, 2018; he has continuously pursued that claim; the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease was reasonably raised during the eosinophilic esophagitis claim.

2. Prior to the digestive system rating amendments, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease were co-existing digestive disabilities that could not be rated separately.

3. Prior to June 22, 2023, accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease manifested in alternating diarrhea and constipation but not frequent episodes of abdominal distress; the Veteran's esophageal symptoms were attributed to his eosinophilic esophagitis and rated under Diagnostic Code 7203.

4. From June 22, 2023, accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication and pursuant to the pre-amended rating criteria, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease manifested in alternating diarrhea and constipation but not frequent episodes of abdominal distress; the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease did not manifest in material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

5. From May 19, 2024, under the amended rating criteria, after accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease has manifested in abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and change in stool frequency, change in stool form, and altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency).

6. Under the amended rating criteria, the Veteran's esophageal symptoms are already rated under Diagnostic Code 7203, so assigning a separate rating for gastroesophageal reflux disease under Diagnostic Code 7206, separate from irritable bowel syndrome, would constitute impermissible pyramiding.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 6, 2018, but no earlier, for gastroesophageal reflux disease are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2009 to June 2015 with additional service in the National Guard.

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) will provide a procedural history that includes the history of an Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) claim since it is relevant to the discussion below.  However, the Board has adjudicated the EE appeal in a separate decision.  See Board decision on Docket Number 240329-429404.

On June 6, 2018, the Veteran applied for service connection for EE.  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the Veteran's claim in September 2018.  The Veteran appealed.  The Board granted service connection in July 2022.  In a July 2022 Rating Decision, the RO implemented the grant by assigning a 10 percent rating for EE from June 6, 2018 (date of claim) and a 50 percent rating from September 14, 2021 (date it was factually ascertainable there was an increase in the disability), under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7299-7203.  Since then, the Veteran continually pursued the EE effective date and rating.  See Board decision on Docket Number 240329-429404.

On June 22, 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, for issues including an increased rating for worsening irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and service connection for GERD.  In August 2023, the RO continued the noncompensable rating for IBS based on alternating diarrhea and constipation.  In December 2023, the RO granted service connection for GERD and rated it together with IBS at 30 percent disabling from August 10, 2022 (date of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) change in law).  A 30 percent rating was granted for GERD due to the GERD symptoms of dysphagia, persistently recurrent epigastric distress, pyrosis (heartburn and/or reflux), and symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.  The RO rated IBS together with GERD and assigned a 30 percent disability rating based on GERD as the predominant disability.   

The RO then proposed to change the effective date for the grant of service-connection to June 22, 2023 (date of claim) due to being granted secondary to EE and not based on a change in law in the PACT Act.  See February 13, 2024 correspondence.  The Veteran submitted a Higher-Review Review to the proposal, which the RO rejected as premature.

In June 2024, the RO finalized the change of effective date and assigned a later effective date of June 22, 2023 (date of claim) for GERD.  As such, the Veteran is rated for IBS with GERD under DC 7319-7346 from June 22, 2023 at 30 percent disabling.  GERD is the predominant disability.  In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the IBS with GERD effective dates and ratings.  He elected the Direct review docket.  The Veteran also contemporaneously submitted evidence with the appeal. The Board is mindful of the recent case of Edwards v. McDonough, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2023), where the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reminded the Board of its obligations "to read the documents that a claimant files in support of his [or her] appeal liberally and sympathetically" and "to consider the full context within which [veterans'] submissions are made." Id. at 62 (citing Rivera v. Shinseki, 654 F.3d 1377, 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). The backdrop for this reminder is 38 C.F.R. § 202(f).  That regulation requires the Board to contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent whenever the Board cannot identify which review option the claimant intends to select.  The Board can identify which review option the Veteran seeks due to the submission of duplicate Notice of Disagreements electing the Direct Review option and a follow-up email from the Veteran's Attorney to see whether the Board or RO were processing the Veteran's choice.  See also December 30, 2024 Board letter informing Veteran that the Notice of Disagreement had been accepted.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, direct review by the Board without submission of additional evidence and without a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the respective decisions on the issues on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that the Veteran also submitted a June 2024 Higher-Level Review for due process errors in the change of the GERD effective date.  The Veteran's Attorney sought clarification about whether the issue was being adjudicated in the RO or Board.  See December 9, 2024 Attorney's email.  The RO informed the Veteran's Attorney that the HLR had been cancelled and referred the Attorney to the Board to determine the status of the Notice of Disagreement.  See December 11, 2024 RO's email.  The Board informed the Veteran and his Attorney that it had accepted to June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  See December 30, 2024 letter.  As such, the Board finds the June 2024 Notice of Disagreement does not violate the rule against concurrent review in multiple lanes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.    

There is evidence in the Veteran's claims file that arrived there after the decision on appeal, which means the Board may not consider it in deciding this appeal.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Finally, the Board notes a 2022 motion to advance a previous appeal on the Board's docket due to increased insurance costs.  If Veteran is suffering from a serious illness, is under severe financial hardship, or has other sufficient cause, he can request to have an appeal "Advanced on the Docket," or moved to the front of the line.  See April 16, 2024 letter.  If the Veteran is age 75 or older, his appeal will automatically be prioritized, and he does not have to submit anything further.  To request advancement on the docket, the Veteran must submit a brief explanation of the reasons why the Board should prioritize his case.  He should also include documentation that supports his explanation.  For example, if he has severe financial hardship, examples of evidence he may submit to demonstrate severe financial hardship include, but are not limited to, evidence he is experiencing homelessness, a home foreclosure or eviction notice, or a financial status report (VA Form 5655).  The Board has not received sufficient supporting evidence showing severe financial hardship, so the current appeal has not been expedited pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c)(1).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).  However, the Board notes a July 2024 statement submitted to the Veteran's Senator, roughly contemporaneous with this appeal, where the Veteran reiterated that he is "requesting that the VA immediately review the claims(s) (referring to his Board appeals) and process them with expedience."  The Veteran is also represented by counsel who is familiar with the process of switching dockets and making procedural decisions with respect to this appeal.  From these facts, the Board concludes that the Veteran has waived the opportunity wait additional time for the purpose of deciding whether to switch dockets and that the Veteran desires an answer on his Board appeals "with expedience."  Therefore, the Board proceeds to issue this decision at this time in accordance with the Veteran's expressed wishes.

Factual history 

The Board will begin the factual history with the Veteran's initial claim for EE because the Board later finds that entitlement to service connection for GERD was reasonably raised during the pendency of the Veteran's EE claim.

The Veteran stated that the date of onset of his severe esophageal symptoms was in September 2016.  See February 2021 Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination report.  The Veteran stated that his EE began with being diagnosed in 2016 by a physician in 2016.  Id.  He stated he had an EGD in 2016.  Id.  He stated he had biopsies of the esophagus and did blood work.  Id.  He stated he was then diagnosed with EE.  Id.  He stated he was sent to an allergy physician, but it was negative for any known allergies.  Id.  He stated he was sent back to the gastroenterologist and was prescribed oral Flovent, Omeprazole.  Id.  He stated he had esophageal dilatation on three separate occasions.  Id.  He stated the condition had worsened.  Id.  In a November 2017 Asthma, Allergy & Immunology Clinic, Dr. E stated that the Veteran had tried Omeprazole and swallowed Flovent and neither of these medications were helpful at all.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran took them both for about 6 months and the symptoms worsened despite the medication and he stopped them.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had not used oral steroids.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had two pretty severe impactions in the past.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had not always been able to feel them immediately.  Id.  Dr. E stated that on one occasion he was okay for a while after eating, but then started to have food back up and he choked and threw up.  Id.  Dr. E. stated that the Veteran did not seek medical care on that occasion.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran had to go to the ER just the once.  Id.  Dr. E stated that the Veteran apparently got a shot of glucagon, and the food passed before it had to be removed.  Id.

In July 2018, the RO afforded the Veteran an Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination.  A July 2018 examiner diagnosed EE.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication (Flovent, Omeprazole) for the EE.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms were dysphagia and regurgitation.  The July 2018 examiner stated that the severity of the Veteran's esophageal disability was that it was amenable to dilation.    

In February 2021, the RO afforded the Veteran another Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination report.  A February 2021 examiner diagnosed EE.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran had acid reflux, regurgitation, dysphagia, and mild chest discomfort.  The February 2021 examiner stated the Veteran had not had nausea/vomiting or melena.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran had noted that he had esophageal erosions.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran had the esophagus dilated.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran had 6-7 EGD's since 2016.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication (Flovent, Pantoprazole) for the EE.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms were infrequent episodes of epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, and substernal pain.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the severity of the Veteran's esophageal disability was that it was amenable to dilation.  The February 2021 examiner stated that the functional impact was that the Veteran was not worldwide deployable.

In September 2021 VA treatment records, the Veteran stated he had abdominal pain due to Omeprazole.  In October 2021, an informal PEB was initiated and the PEB's final finding, on October 25, 2021, was that the Veteran was unfit for retention due to inability to reasonably perform required duties.  It assigned a 50 percent rating on October 29, 2021.  

In August 2022 VA treatment records, the Veteran reported a lot of defecation issues, stating he was either constipated or running to the bathroom.  The Veteran stated he had experienced these symptoms since about 2010.  The Veteran stated he would typically go a day without having a bowel movement, which he described as constipation, then would have a day with 4-5 bowel movements that he described as chunky soup.  The Veteran stated he typically went back and forth between these symptoms daily.  The Veteran stated he had associated urgency without incontinence, and no nighttime awakening.  The Veteran endorsed complete evacuation.  The Veteran reported bright red blood in the stool and on the toilet paper, which occurred every couple of months, and had been present since 2010. The Veteran reported having a rectal exam around the time it started but was unsure of the findings.  The Veteran stated he had not had a colonoscopy.  The Veteran stated he was not taking anything for bowel movements.  The Veteran's Hgb was 14.9.  An August 2022 clinician recommend initiating psyllium fiber daily.  The Veteran denied abdominal pain or distress. 

In May 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran another Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination.  A May 2023 examiner diagnosed EE and stricture of the esophagus.  The Veteran stated that his disability began in 2015 when he first noticed choking on food, initially steak and then ultimately he was unable to swallow down pudding and then water.  The Veteran stated he was treated with esophageal dilation several times a year.  The May 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran had been trialed on multiple medications without success.  The Veteran reported he still had trouble passing and keeping food down in the esophagus.  The Veteran reported that food got stuck and he developed pain where the food got stuck.  The Veteran stated that he maintained a soft diet most days to prevent food from getting lodged in the esophagus.  He stated he had frequent dilations by GI.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran's treatment plan included taking continuous medication (Flovent, Omeprazole, elimination diet, allergy testing) without success.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms were productive of considerable impairment of health and included persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal and shoulder pain, sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux, nausea, and vomiting.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the severity of the Veteran's esophageal disability was moderate as dilation provided temporary relief, but the frequency of symptoms crescendo until he ultimately had to switch to a soft diet and then scheduled for dilation.  The May 2023 examiner stated that the functional impact of the Veteran's EE and stricture of the esophagus was that the Veteran had frequent episodes of food getting stuck in esophagus which then caused him to regurgitate everything he consumed.  This caused pain and difficulty performing work functions.  He had to follow a soft diet when this occurred.  He had impaired sleep which caused impairment of concentration and extreme fatigue.  His work productivity suffered.  He had missed workdays due to dilations and follow up appointments related to this disability.  

In July 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran an Intestinal Conditions (Other than Surgical or Infectious) (Including IBS, Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis, and diverticulitis) examination. A July 2023 examiner diagnosed the Veteran with IBS.  The July 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran's symptoms mainly consisted of diarrhea with episodes of constipation.  The July 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had loose stools nearly every day.  The July 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran was given Loperamide through the VA for this disability.  The Veteran stated that he was on Loperamide (once a day) for about six months and had never taken the medication prior.  The July 2023 examiner determined that the Veteran did not have bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, nor exacerbations or attacks of the intestinal disability.

In September 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran another Esophageal Conditions (including GERD, hiatal hernia and other esophageal disorders) examination.  A September 2023 examiner diagnosed GERD and stricture of the esophagus.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran was diagnosed with EE during evaluation for dysphagia in 2016.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran was also found to have esophageal stricture and resultant GERD.  The Veteran stated that he had several esophageal dilations, about every six months, since the diagnosis.  The Veteran stated that he took Pantoprazole for GERD.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health, persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, and sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux.  The Veteran had four or more symptom recurrence per year and average duration of episodes of symptoms were 10 days or more.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had esophageal stricture characterized as severe and amenable to dilation.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had significant difficulty swallowing solids, requiring dilation intermittently.  The functional impact was that the Veteran stated he missed work one to two times a month due to pyrosis.  The September 2023 examiner also opined that the Veteran's GERD was due to his service-connected EE.  As a rationale, the September 2023 examiner recited the medical history summarized above.  The September 2023 examiner also opined that the Veteran's GERD was caused by toxic exposure since the Veteran was service connected for EE due to toxic exposure and was also found to have esophageal stricture and resultant GERD.   

Law

Effective date

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection shall be the later of the date of receipt of the application or the date that the entitlement to the benefit arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

On March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sep. 25, 2014).

Effective February 19, 2019, under VA's modernized appeals system, a claimant may seek review of an initial decision by filing a Supplemental Claim, request for Higher-Level Review, or Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  After a decision is issued in response to a request for Higher-Level Review, a claimant may seek further review by filing a Supplemental Claim or NOD.  After filing an NOD, a claimant may seek further review by filing a Supplemental Claim or timely appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Moreover, under VA's modernized appeals system, the effective date is fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options described above within one year of the decision, or with respect to an appeal to the CAVC, by filing an appeal that is accepted as timely by that court.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Claims to reopen no longer exist with the implementation of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) on February 19, 2019.  However, the effective date for an award based on an original claim or a claim reopened after a final adjudication is fixed in accordance with the facts found but is not earlier than the date of receipt of application.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  When an award is based on a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, the effective date is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless new and material evidence was received within the relevant appeal period.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q).

Increased rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.  Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different evaluations at any point during the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is appropriate. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The assignment of a particular DC is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case." Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993). One DC may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. The Board may consider whether another rating code is "more appropriate" than the one used by the RO. See Tedeschi v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 411, 414 (1995). Any change in a DC must be specifically explained. Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625, 629 (1992). 

Irritable bowel syndrome/gastroesophageal reflux disease 

The Veteran's irritable bowel syndrome/gastroesophageal reflux disease is rated together by analogy to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346, for hiatal hernia, and under, DC 7319, for IBS.  Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. Also relevant is the note at the beginning of the rating schedule for the digestive system: Ratings under DCs 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other. A single evaluation will be assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.

Effective May 19, 2024, VA amended the schedule for rating disabilities of the digestive system.  See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: The Digestive System, 89 Fed. Reg. 19, 735 (Mar. 20, 2024).  Pursuant to this amendment, VA created DC 7206 for GERD and revised DC 7346 for hiatal hernia to direct VA adjudicators to rate this disability pursuant to stricture of the esophagus under DC 7203.  In the amended criteria, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under DCs 7301 through 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, 7345 through 7350 inclusive, 7352, and 7355 through 7357 inclusive will not be combined with each other.  Instead, when more than one rating is warranted under those DCs, the adjudicator assigns a single evaluation under the DC that reflects the predominant disability picture, and elevates it to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

The pre-amendment rating criteria apply only to claims filed before May 19, 2024.  For claims filed before May 19, 2024 (as is the case here), both the pre- and post-amendment rating criteria are applied based on whichever is more favorable to the claimant.  However, if the post-amendment criteria are more favorable to the claimant, the award based on the post-amendment criteria may not be made effective before May 19, 2024.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).

Pre-May 19, 2024 Amendment

Pursuant to DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.  A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  

DC 7346 does not provide definitions for the terms "considerable" and "severe."  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence, to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. In the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning. Prokarym v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 307, 310 (2015).  For reference, "considerable" is defined as "large in extent or degree."  Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 267 (11th ed. 2012).  "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful." Id. at 1140. 

In assigning disability ratings for DCs that do not mention medication, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  The Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation for these DCs.  See Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327.  The rating criteria are not successive or cumulative with that of the lower rating.  See Tatum v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 152, 155 (2009); see also Stankevich v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 470, 472 (2006) (the Court recognized that disabilities rated by analogy will not show all objective criteria of the analogous rating).

DC 7319 provides a 30 percent rating for severe irritable colon syndrome, with diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea and constipation, with more or less constant abdominal distress.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  DC 7319 provides a 10 percent rating for moderate symptoms demonstrated by frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress.

Post May 19, 2024 Amendment

Both DC 7206 and DC 7203 contain identical rating criteria with identical Notes. Note (3) to both DC 7206 and DC 7203 provide that they are applicable to more than just GERD and hiatal hernia.  Specifically, they apply to the following non-exhaustive list of other disabilities: esophagitis, mechanical or chemical; Mallory Weiss syndrome (bleeding at junction of esophagus and stomach due to tears) due to caustic ingestion of alkali or acid; drug-induced or infectious esophagitis due to Candida, virus, or other organism; idiopathic eosinophilic, or lymphocytic esophagitis; esophagitis due to radiation therapy; esophagitis due to peptic stricture; and any esophageal condition that requires treatment with sclerotherapy.

Pursuant to DC 7206, a noncompensable rating is warranted for a documented history without daily symptoms or requirement for daily medications.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of esophageal stricture(s) that requires daily medications to control dysphagia otherwise asymptomatic.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires dilatation no more than 2 times per year.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia which requires at least one of the following (1) dilatation 3 or more times per year, (2) dilatation using steroids at least one time per year, or (3) esophageal stent placement.  A maximum 80 percent rating is warranted for a documented history of recurrent or refractory esophageal stricture(s) causing dysphagia with at least one of these symptoms present: (1) aspiration, (2) undernutrition, and/or (3) substantial weight loss as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a), and treatment with either surgical correction of esophageal stricture(s) or percutaneous esophago-gastrointestinal tube (PEG tube).  38 C.F.R. § 4.112(a) defines substantial weight loss as "involuntary loss greater than 20% of an individual's baseline weight sustained for three months with diminished quality of self-care or work tasks."

DC 7206 contains several notes to assist in its application.  Note (1) provides that findings associated with the disability in question must be documented by barium swallow, computerized tomography, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Note (2), directs VA to evaluate non-gastrointestinal complications of procedures of the disability at issue under the appropriate system at issue.

Notes (4) and (5) define recurrent and refractory esophageal strictures as contemplated by DC 7206.  Specifically, Note (4) defines recurrent esophageal stricture as "the inability to maintain target esophageal diameter beyond 4 weeks after the target diameter has been achieved."  Comparatively, Note (5) defines refractory esophageal stricture as "the inability to achieve target esophageal diameter despite receiving no fewer than 5 dilatation sessions performed at 2-week intervals."

DC 7319 provides for a 30 percent rating for abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  DC 7319 provides for a 20 percent rating for abdominal pain related to defecation for at least three days per month during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  DC 7319 provides for a 10 percent rating for abdominal pain related to defecation at least once during the previous three months; and two or more of the following: (1) change in stool frequency, (2) change in stool form, (3) altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency), (4) mucorrhea, (5) abdominal bloating, or (6) subjective distension.  A note states that this DC may include functional digestive disorders (see § 3.317 of this chapter), such as dyspepsia, functional bloating and constipation, and diarrhea. Evaluate other symptoms of a functional digestive disorder not encompassed by this DC under the appropriate DC, to include gastrointestinal dysmotility syndrome (DC 7356), following the general principles of § 4.14 and this section.

Service connection

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability that is due to or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that (1) a current disability exists and (2) the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995) (en banc); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead holding "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to exhaust all schedular alternatives for rating a disability that are expressly raised or are reasonably raised by the record. Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162 (2019).  The Board is required to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability.  Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203-04 (2021).

"When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for gastroesophageal reflux disease

The Veteran's Attorney asserts that since VA examiners agree that GERD is secondary to EE, the effective date should be when the symptoms began.  See March 2024 statement.  The Veteran's Attorney also appeals the June 22, 2023 effective date for IBS with GERD because the Veteran requested a higher rating for his IBS in June 2023 and increased ratings can be as early as one year prior.  See June 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

As noted above, the Veteran was assigned a noncompensable rating for IBS from June 8, 2015, under DC 7319, and a 30 percent disability rating for IBS with GERD from June 22, 2023 under DC 7319-7346.  As summarized in the procedural history above, the RO rated these disabilities together under DC 7319-7346 from June 22, 2023 because service connection for GERD was only granted from that date. The Board acknowledges that the RO granted the Veteran an increased 30 percent rating for GERD with IBS, effective June 22, 2023.  This decision first addresses whether the evidence of record supports an earlier effective date for GERD since it is expressly raised by the Attorney. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that there is no argument of Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE).  The Board interprets any mention of CUE in the record as the Veteran's Attorney referencing the RO's GERD effective date change due to CUE in the February 2024 decision. 

Bailey v. Wilkie

The Board finds that issue of entitlement to service connection for GERD due to service-connected EE was reasonably raised by the record prior to the Veteran submitting a claim for service connection for GERD in June 2023. 

The Veteran has been diagnosed with GERD.  See, e.g., September 2023 Esophageal Conditions C&P exam.  The Veteran is also service connected for EE.  Accordingly, the first and second elements of secondary service connection are met.

The remaining question is whether the Veteran's current GERD being due to or aggravated by his service-connected EE was reasonably raised during the continuously pursued EE claim that began on June 6, 2018.  The Board finds that GERD was reasonably raised during the EE claim.

While the July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P examiners only diagnosed EE, the Board finds that the evidence was at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's GERD had manifested already.  Notably, the September 2023 C&P examiner stated in the Veteran's medical history that the Veteran was also found to have esophageal stricture and resultant GERD.  The Board finds that this statement regarding esophageal stricture and resultant GRED raised the issue of service connection for GERD secondary to EE from June 6, 2018.

The evidence before the September 2023 C&P exam and opinion do not provide robust explanations regarding the onset of the Veteran's GERD.  For that reason, the reasonably raised claim of GERD could be remanded for a retrospective opinion.  However, the fact remains that the evidence is in approximate balance for and against service connection for GERD as a reasonably raised issue secondary to EE from June 6, 2018.  Thus, after applying the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, the Board finds that the September 2023 C&P exam and opinion are adequate to raise service connection for GERD as a reasonably raised issue from June 6, 2018.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).    

Service connection for GERD is granted as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected EE.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310.  As such, after affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt of being a reasonably raised disability secondary to EE, an earlier effective date of June 6, 2018 is granted for GERD.

The Veteran is not seeking, and the law prohibits the award of, an even earlier effective date of service connection, as June 6, 2018 is the first claim for EE and there was no Intent to File from which to award an earlier effective date.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran's date of claim for EE of June 6, 2018 is the earliest effective date the law allows for his reasonably raised secondary disability of GERD.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease

3. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux disease, rated as 30 percent disabling from June 22, 2023, based on pre-amended rating criteria

The next question for the Board is whether the Veteran's 30 percent rating for IBS with GERD can go back to June 6, 2018.  The Board finds that it cannot.

As mentioned above, the Veteran sought a higher disability rating for his service-connected IBS.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Pursuant to the above Board decision, the Veteran is now assigned a noncompensable rating for IBS with GERD from June 6, 2018 under DC 7319-7346, and a 30 percent disability rating for IBS with GERD from June 22, 2023 (also under DC 7319-7346).  The Board will first consider whether a compensable rating is warranted for the Veteran's IBS prior to June 22, 2023 based on the one-year lookback period.  Then, the Board will consider whether a compensable rating is warranted prior to June 22, 2023 based on the Veteran's IBS with GERD symptoms.  Finally, the Board will consider whether a rating in excess of 30 percent is warranted for IBS with GERD from June 22, 2023 based on the pre-amended digestive system rating criteria.

First, the Board finds that prior to June 22, 2023, even accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's IBS did not manifest in more or less constant abdominal distress during the one year prior to him filing a claim for an increased disability rating.  The Board finds the July 2023 examiner's conclusion that the Veteran did not have episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, or exacerbations or attacks of the intestinal condition, persuasive because it was consistent with the VA treatment records.  VA treatment records prior to and after the Veteran starting medication show that the Veteran denied abdominal pain or distress.  As noted above, a single evaluation is assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  Here, prior to June 22, 2023 the Board finds that the overall severity of the Veteran's IBS with GERD did not warrant a compensable evaluation because there is insufficient evidence that the Veteran's IBS manifested in abdominal distress.     

Next, the Board will consider whether a higher rating is warranted prior to June 22, 2023, based on GERD symptoms.  As noted in the factual history above, the July 2018, February 2021, and May 2023 C&P examiners attributed the Veteran's esophageal symptoms to his EE.  The were no other pertinent physical findings that were attributed to his GERD only.  GERD was not diagnosed on an Esophageal Conditions C&P exam until September 2023.  The September 2023 C&P examiner attributed the Veteran's GERD to the development of esophageal stricture.  The Board has considered the beneficial effects of medication.  However, as all the esophageal symptoms prior to the September 2023 C&P exam were attributed to the Veteran's EE, the Board finds that medication consideration does not change the overall GERD disability picture.  As noted above, a single evaluation is assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  Here, prior to June 22, 2023 the Board finds that the overall severity of the Veteran's IBS with GERD did not warrant a compensable evaluation because the Veteran's esophageal symptoms were attributed to his EE.  As such, compensating the Veteran for his EE and GERD prior to June 22, 2023 would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  See Board decision on Docket Number 240329-429404 for greater discussion on EE.

Third, the Board will consider whether a rating in excess of 30 percent is warranted for IBS with GERD from June 22, 2023 based on the pre-amended digestive system rating criteria.  The Board finds the July 2023 examiner's conclusion that the Veteran did not have episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress, or exacerbations or attacks of the intestinal condition, persuasive because it was consistent with the VA treatment records.  VA treatment records prior to and after the Veteran starting medication show that the Veteran denied abdominal pain or distress.  As such, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent for IBS with GERD based on the IBS rating criteria is not warranted.  The Board also finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent based on the GERD rating criteria is not warranted, even after considering the ameliorative effects of medication.  The Veteran stated that he took Pantoprazole for GERD.  The September 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health, persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, and sleep disturbance caused by esophageal reflux.  The Veteran had four or more symptom recurrence per year and average duration of episodes of symptoms were 10 days or more.  The Board finds that the Veteran's symptom combinations were not productive of severe impairment of health based on GERD.  Rather, the Veteran primarily experienced pain due to food getting stuck in the esophagus, which the Veteran is rated for under EE.  While the Board will not disturb the favorable finding that the Veteran's GERD alone resulted in considerable impairment of health apart from EE, the Board finds that his symptom combinations were not productive of severe impairment of health.  As noted above, a single evaluation is assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  Here, from June 22, 2023 the Board finds that the overall severity of the Veteran's IBS with GERD did not warrant a rating in excess of 30 percent because there is insufficient evidence that the Veteran's IBS with GERD manifested in severe impairment of health.  

As for the potential for an even higher disability rating under a different DC, there is also no evidence of chronic gastritis with severe hemorrhages, or large ulcerated or eroded areas (pertaining to DC 7307); and no evidence of either interference with absorption and nutrition, manifested by impairment of health objectively supported by examination findings including definite weight loss or marked interference with absorption and nutrition, manifested by severe impairment of health objectively supported by examination findings including material weight loss (pertaining to DC 7328). Significantly, the C&P examination reports are negative for hematemesis, melena, and weight loss productive of severe impairment of health. Therefore, there is no basis for a higher schedular rating under either DCs 7307, 7328, or 7346.  In addition, the Board has not found another DC more appropriate than the one used by the RO to rate the Veteran's IBS with GERD.

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the Veteran's IBS did not manifest in abdominal distress prior to June 22, 2023; his esophageal symptoms prior to June 22, 2023 were attributed to his EE; and his GERD did not manifest in severe impairment of health from June 22, 2023. In addition, elevating the Veteran's IBS with GERD rating to the next higher evaluation based on esophageal pain would constitute impermissible pyramiding since the Veteran is compensated for these same symptoms under DC 7203 for EE.  The Veteran's GERD symptoms were manifest by at worst considerable impairment of health.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on these issues.

4. From May 19, 2024, entitlement to a compensable disability rating for irritable bowel syndrome based on amended rating criteria 

5. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for irritable bowel syndrome with gastroesophageal reflux, rated as 30 percent disabling from June 22, 2023, based on amended rating criteria

Although IBS with GERD are rated together, the RO has assigned a 30 percent disability rating from June 22, 2023, based on the predominant disability - GERD.  The RO determined that the Veteran's IBS manifested in noncompensable symptoms because the evidence did not show abdominal distress.  See August 2023 Rating Decision.  The Board will therefore consider whether a compensable rating can be assigned for IBS under the amended rating criteria.  The Board finds that it can.  The Board will also consider whether assigning a compensable rating for IBS can result in elevating the rating for IBS with GERD to the next higher evaluation based on the severity of the overall disability.  The Board finds that it does not. 

First, the Board finds that based on the amended rating criteria, after accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's IBS has manifested in abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months, and change in stool frequency, change in stool form, and altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency).  This amounts to a 30 percent disability rating for IBS.  However, a higher rating is not warranted under the amended rating criteria for IBS as 30 percent is the schedular maximum for DC 7319.  

Second, as noted above, a single evaluation is assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  As a result of the Board granting a 30 percent evaluation for IBS based on the amended rating criteria, the Veteran is now rated for IBS with GERD under DC 7319-7346.  Both disabilities are 30 percent disabling.  The question for the Board is whether based on the severity of the overall disability, the Veteran's IBS with GERD can be elevated to the next higher evaluation.  The Board finds that it cannot.  As noted above, pursuant to the amended digestive system rating criteria, VA created DC 7206 for GERD and revised DC 7346 for hiatal hernia to direct VA adjudicators to rate this disability pursuant to stricture of the esophagus under DC 7203.  Further, in the amended criteria, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under DCs 7301 through 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, 7345 through 7350 inclusive, 7352, and 7355 through 7357 inclusive are rated together.  When more than one rating is warranted under those DCs, the adjudicator assigns a single evaluation under the DC that reflects the predominant disability picture and elevates it to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

Therefore, effective May 19, 2024, a separate rating for GERD is permitted under DC 7206.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran's esophageal symptoms are already compensated under DC 7203.  As DC 7203 and DC 7206 have the same rating criteria, assigning a separate rating for the Veteran's GERD under DC 7206 would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  In addition, rating EE and GERD together would not result in the Board raising the Veteran's EE (DC 7203) rating to 80 percent disabling as there is insufficient evidence showing that the Veteran's GERD symptoms manifested in either aspiration, undernutrition, and/or substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or PEG tube.  Rather, the Board finds that the Veteran's current DC 7319-7346 is the most appropriate DC and continuing the Veteran's 30 percent rating for IBS with GERD under the pre-amendment rating criteria allows for the maximization of benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that after accounting for the ameliorative effects of medication, the Veteran's IBS has manifested in abdominal pain related to defecation at least one day per week during the previous three months; and change in stool frequency, change in stool form, and altered stool passage (straining and/or urgency); the overall IBS with GERD disability severity does not warrant elevation to the next higher evaluation.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on this issue.

6. Entitlement to a separate rating for irritable bowel syndrome or gastroesophageal reflux disease

The issue of separating the IBS and GERD disabilities is raised by the Attorney.  See February 2024 Higher-Level Review.  The Board will consider whether separate ratings are warranted under the pre-amended criteria and then under the amended criteria.

Pre-May 19, 2024 Amendment

As stated above, the Schedule of Ratings of the Digestive System provides that ratings under DCs 7301 to 7329, inclusive, 7331, 7342, and 7345 to 7348 inclusive will not be combined with each other.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  A single evaluation will be assigned the predominant disability picture, with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such elevation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  

Accordingly, a separate rating under DC 7346 may not be assigned as a matter of law.  For the Veteran's predominant esophageal symptom of difficulty swallowing food, he is rated under DC 7203 as the most appropriate DC.  Elevation to the next higher evaluation under DC 7346 based upon the severity of the Veteran's overall disability is not warranted, since there is insufficient evidence to show a marked impairment of his general health.  

May 19, 2024 Amended Rating Criteria

As noted above, pursuant to the amended digestive system rating criteria, VA created DC 7206 for GERD and revised DC 7346 for hiatal hernia to direct VA adjudicators to rate this disability pursuant to stricture of the esophagus under DC 7203.  Further, in the amended criteria, in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, ratings under DCs 7301 through 7329 inclusive, 7331, 7342, 7345 through 7350 inclusive, 7352, and 7355 through 7357 inclusive will still not be combined with each other (i.e., will not be rated separately).  Instead, when more than one rating is warranted under those DCs, the adjudicator assigns a single evaluation under the DC that reflects the predominant disability picture and elevates it to the next higher evaluation if warranted by the severity of the overall disability.

Therefore, effective May 19, 2024, a separate rating for GERD is permitted under DC 7206.  However, the Board finds that the Veteran's esophageal symptoms (recurrent/refractory esophageal strictures causing dysphagia which requires dilation three or more times per year) are already compensated under DC 7203.    As DC 7203 and DC 7206 have the same rating criteria, assigning a separate rating for the Veteran's GERD under DC 7206 would constitute impermissible pyramiding.  In addition, rating EE and GERD together would not result in the Board raising the Veteran's disability rating to 80 percent under DC 7203 as there is insufficient evidence showing that the Veteran's GERD symptoms manifest in either aspiration, undernutrition, and/or substantial weight loss as defined by § 4.112(a) and treatment with either surgical correction or PEG tube.  Rather, continuing the Veteran's 30 percent rating for IBS with GERD under the pre-amendment rating criteria allows for the maximization of benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).     

In reaching these conclusions, the Board has considered and applied the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  "When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  In this case, the evidence persuasively favors a finding that based on pre-amended rating criteria, separate ratings for DC 7319 and DC 7346 are barred as a matter of law; and based on the amended rating criteria, the Veteran esophageal symptoms are already fully compensated under DC 7203.  Thus, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not change the outcome on these issues.

 

 

RAY BARTO SLABBEKORN, JR.

Veterans Law Judge

Board of Veterans' Appeals

Attorney for the Board	Koottappillil, Arun X.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
