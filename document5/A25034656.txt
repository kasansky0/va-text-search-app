ORDER

Entitlement to total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to a single disability is dismissed.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The December 2023 rating decision implemented the December 2023 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision, which awarded a TDIU rating from March 9, 2021, but denied SMC at the housebound rate. Such a rating decision is ministerial and thus is not a decision that can be appealed to the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issues of entitlement to a TDIU rating based on a single disability and SMC at the housebound rate have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1967 to June 1969. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), also known as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU rating based on a single disability. 

2. Entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate. 

By way of history, in the December 2023 Board decision, the Veteran was granted a TDIU rating effective March 9, 2021, the first date that he met the schedular criteria for a TDIU rating. See also December 2023 rating decision codesheet. The Board granted a TDIU rating based on a combination of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lymphedema bilateral leg caused by cellulitis, laceration of skin and subcutaneous tissue, right ring finger, hypertension, residuals of hepatocellular carcinoma, s/p partial hepatectomy, residuals of hypothyroidism, diffuse thyroid hyperplasia status post subtotal thyroidectomy, Hepatitis C, and residual scar, right leg abrasion. However, the Board also specifically stated that "[a]s the Board has found that the Veteran's total disability is a result of a combination of his service-connected disabilities, the Veteran is not entitled to special monthly compensation at the housebound rate." Subsequently, the AOJ implemented the Board's award of a TDIU rating effective March 9, 2021, in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal. 

In response to the December 2023 rating decision, the Veteran filed the December 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran's representative stated that they were appealing the December 2023 rating decision, and listed SMC at the housebound rate as the issue on appeal. More specifically, the representative explained that in the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ failed to grant SMC at the housebound rate on account of the Veteran's PTSD in and of itself rendering him unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment and having other service-connected disabilities that combine to equal at least 60 percent disabling. 

SMC is authorized in particular circumstances in addition to compensation for service-connected disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.352. SMC benefits require that the conditions described be due to service-connected disability. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1), when a veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disability independently ratable at 60 percent or more, he or she is entitled to a SMC rating. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1). In Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) stated that total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) can qualify for compensation at the 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) rate, but only if the TDIU is based on a single disability. Id. at 293. The "60 percent" requirement in 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) may be met by pooling multiple disabilities by using the combined ratings table in 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Gazelle v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 461, 467 (2016).

Returning to the present case and the December 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran is appealing for a TDIU rating due solely to his service-connected PTSD because from March 26, 2021, the Veteran also had a 60 percent rating for lymphedema bilateral leg caused by cellulitis. See December 2024 rating decision codesheet. Accordingly, if the Veteran were awarded a TDIU rating based solely on PTSD, then he would meet the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1). 

Unfortunately, the Board finds that for reasons described below, the December 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued solely to implement the December 2023 Board decision. In the Encarnacion case, the Court discussed how the Board must address appeals of rating decisions that are issued to implement decisions of the Board. Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023) (overruled in part on other grounds). The Court first stated that 38 U.S.C. § 7104 provides that the Board's jurisdiction is wholly derivative of the Secretary's and that it establishes that "[a]ll questions in a matter under [38 U.S.C. § 511(a)] shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary," and "[f]inal decisions on such appeals shall be made by the Board." Id. at 200. (internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations and emphasis in original). The Court then noted that, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 511(a), a Board decision is deemed the "final and conclusive determination of the Secretary as to any discrete issue decided" in that decision. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

With these statutory provisions in mind, the Court then found that a "pure" implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision "affect[ing] the provision of benefits" under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) and, thus, such decisions are not appealable to the Board, which had already rendered the Secretary's final determination on the issue in question. Id. (alterations in original). The Court referred to such implementations as purely ministerial in nature, as opposed to decisions capable of being appealed through the filing of a notice of disagreement. Id. at 201.

In applying the Encarnacion to this case, the Board finds that the December 2023 rating decision was a purely ministerial implementation of the December 2023 Board decision concerning the issue of entitlement to a TDIU rating based on a single disability, and SMC at the housebound rate. In the December 2023 Board decision, the Veteran was granted a TDIU rating effective March 9, 2021. The Board also specifically stated that the Veteran's TDIU rating was the result of a combination of disabilities and therefore he was not entitled to SMC at the housebound rate. As a result, the December 2023 rating decision that granted a TDIU rating effective March 9, 2021, and did not grant a TDIU rating based on a single disability or SMC at the housebound rate, was a purely ministerial implementation of the December 2023 Board decision. The AOJ also did not render any findings in the December 2023 rating decision on issues already determined by the Board. See Donovan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 404, 409 (1997).

Accordingly, the Board must dismiss the Veteran's appeal because he has sought appellate review of a purely ministerial decision of the AOJ which implemented the December 2023 Board decision. As such, entitlement to a TDIU rating based on a single disability and SMC at the housebound rate are dismissed. 

Notwithstanding this dismissal, the extent to which the December 17, 2024, VA Form 10182 may be construed as a motion for reconsideration of the December 12, 2023 Board decision is a separate consideration by the Chairman, and not addressed herein. It will be addressed in separate correspondence.
