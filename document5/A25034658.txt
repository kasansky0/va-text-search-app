ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include schizoaffective disorder, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A December 2024 rating decision granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type; this represents a full grant of the issue on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met for dismissal of the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include schizoaffective disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from February 2007 to June 2008.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request form to appeal his claim to the Board and selected the Direct Review lane.  As explained in the VA Form 10182, "direct review" means that the Board's decision must be based upon the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision, with no evidence submission or hearing request.  As such, the Board has considered only the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 decision.

In the November 2023 rating decision that treated the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder reopened, the AOJ implicitly determined that new and relevant evidence was received to warrant readjudicating the claim for service connection for PTSD.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  As such, the Board need not adjudicate the reopening of the claim again and may proceed to the merits of the service connection claim.

In addition to the claim for service connection for a mood disorder, the record also reflects a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder.  As such, the Board has expanded the Veteran's claim to include the matter of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than a mood disorder and has recharacterized the issue accordingly.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include schizoaffective disorder

A December 2024 rating decision granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.  The October 2024 Decision Review Request Form 10182 requested service connection for depression, although the only rating decision that had been issued in the previous year was the November 2023 denial of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

When service connection was granted for PTSD with schizoaffective disorder in December 2024, that decision was a full grant of the benefit sought (i.e., service connection).  Therefore, there is no case or controversy presently before the Board, and this issue is dismissed.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).
