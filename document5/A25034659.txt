REMANDED

Entitlement to an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1987 to July 1992, during Peacetime and the Gulf War Era.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which decreased the evaluation of bilateral hearing loss from 10 percent disabling to 0 percent disabling, effective September 29, 2020. 

In the November 2020 Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal (October 8, 2020). The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period the decision on appeal (on or after October 9, 2020). 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.301. However, because this case is being remanded, any evidence that is not considered by the Board at this time will be considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) upon readjudication of this claim.

By way of background, in a May 2018 rating decision, based upon an April 2018 VA examination, the AOJ increased the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability rating from noncompensable to 10 percent disabling. Then, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim in March 2020. Following a September 2020 VA examination, the AOJ reduced the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability rating from 10 percent disabling to noncompensable in an October 2020 rating decision, which is the subject of this appeal. The Veteran appealed that decision in a November 2020 Board Appeal: Notice of Disagreement, VA Form 10182. In an April 2024 Board decision, the Board restored the 10 percent evaluation and denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss. Then, the AOJ implemented the restoration of the 10 percent evaluation in an April 2024 rating decision.

Subsequently, the Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court). In a November 2024 Order, the Court vacated the portion of the Board's April 2024 decision that denied a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss and remanded the matter pursuant to the November 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR). The claim now returns to the Board for further consideration as a result of the November 2024 Order from the Court and JMPR.

Turning to the merits of the claim, in the November 2024 JMPR, the parties to the JMPR agreed that "claimants are entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of this chapter before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." The parties stated 38 C.F.R. ยง 3.103(b)(1) requires notice of decisions made by Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) affecting the payment of benefits or granting of relief that includes notice of the right to a hearing. The parties stated that despite having the right to a hearing prior to the AOJ issuing a decision on an appeal, the Appellant was not provided notice of this right before the AOJ issued a decision, namely the October 8, 2020 rating decision. Lastly, the parties stated that on remand, the Board must direct the AOJ to provide Appellant with notice of her right to a hearing and then readjudicate her claim based on the record before it (the AOJ), including determining if the duty to assist required any additional evidentiary development.

As such, the Board finds that remand is required; the AOJ must provide the Veteran with notice of her right to a hearing; and the AOJ must readjudicate the Veteran's claim based on the record before them, including determining if the duty to assist required any additional evidentiary development. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ must provide the Veteran with notice of her right to a hearing and then readjudicate her claim based on the record before them, including determining if the duty to assist required any additional evidentiary development.
