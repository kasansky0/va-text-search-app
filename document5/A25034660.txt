ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 28, 2023 for grant of a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

There was no pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability or TDIU prior to the February 28, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to February 28, 2023, for the grant of a TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served from June 1977 to July 1980.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 28, 2023 for grant of a total disability based upon individual unemployability (TDIU)

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for grant of a TDIU.

As it pertains to effective dates, TDIU earlier effective date claims are not regulated by their own specific subsection of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Rather, such TDIU claims are equivalent to increased rating earlier effective date claims, and thus are governed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o). See, e.g. Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The effective date for an award of an increased rating (including TDIU) will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim for an increased rating, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase; however, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of the claim. In addition, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1), (2).

Current regulations, which became effective March 24, 2015, require that a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). 

In this case, the Veteran filed several claims for service connection in August 2009. No specific claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was included in the August 2009 VA 21-526 Claim. A December 2009 rating decision denied service connection for tinea pedis, bilateral tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss, and migraine headaches. The Veteran did not appeal the December 2009 rating decision, and no new and relevant evidence was received within one year of notice of the rating decision. Therefore, the December 2009 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

Where a prior unappealed decision becomes final, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of the subsequently filed application to reopen and not the date of receipt of the original claim. Leonard v. Nicholson, 405 F.3d 1333, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005). On February 28, 2023, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File. In June 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. There is no document dated between the AOJ's final denial in December 2009 and the February 2023 claim that could be construed as a claim for entitlement to service connection for any disorder.

The Veteran contends that the effective date should be earlier under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Specifically, he contends that his earlier claim for headaches, which he argues are an early symptom of PTSD, should be construed as a claim for an acquired psychiatric disability. He contends that this has now been granted based upon new service records that are associated with the file. 

The Board disagrees. Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim of entitlement to VA benefits could be either "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement[,] or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p) (eff. to Mar. 23, 2015). VA regulations also required that an informal claim "identify the benefit sought." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a) (eff. to Mar. 23, 2015).

Here, there is no other document of record earlier than the established date of claim that may reasonably be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder. The Board acknowledges that the Veteran contends that his claim for headaches should be construed to include a psychiatric disability. While headaches may be associated with PTSD and other psychiatric disabilities, nothing in the Veteran's 2009 claim instead suggests psychiatric symptoms or claim as part of the claim for headaches. The Veteran reported that he had always had headaches since serving in the Navy, when he walked under loud noises with planes, instead suggesting his headaches were related to hazardous noise exposure during service. Thus, the Board finds that the August 2009 claim does not identify the benefit sought (service connection for a psychiatric disorder), and therefore cannot be construed as a formal or informal claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder.

Although the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for the award of TDIU, the legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by such authority. There is no legal basis for assigning an earlier effective date, to include back to the Veteran's August 2009 claims for service connection as he requests. The earliest effective date allowed under VA law and regulations is the currently assigned effective date of February 28, 2023. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400. 

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence weighs persuasively against entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.
