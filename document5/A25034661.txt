ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, including as secondary to OSA, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including as secondary to erectile dysfunction, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus began during, or is otherwise related to, his first period of active-duty service.

2. The Veteran's bilateral pes planus was noted upon entrance to his second period of service and, therefore, the presumptive of soundness does not attach to this period; further, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that any progression of his preexisting bilateral pes planus was due to natural progression of the condition.

3. The persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran had a diagnosis of CFS or a fatigue disorder at any time during the pendency of the appeal.

4. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's GERD began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1111, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for service connection for CFS have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1990 through May 1995. He had additional service in the United States Army Reserve, including a period of active duty from September 2005 to December 2009.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024 and March 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, which was the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 and March 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for OSA, erectile dysfunction, and an acquired psychiatric disorder, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that in the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also attempted to appeal the issue of service connection for upper airway resistance, which was denied in a January 2023 rating decision. Notification of this decision was issued in a January 26, 2023, notification letter. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a claimant has one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision to file a notice of disagreement. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203(b). Because the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was received more than one year after notification of the January 2023 rating decision, the April 2024 VA Form 10182 is untimely as to the issue of service connection for upper airway resistance and the issue will not be considered herein.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Section 303, implemented in 38 U.S.C. § 1168, requires a disability examination and medical opinion for certain non-presumptive conditions involving toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). For such claims, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical opinion when the Veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, has evidence of participation in a TERA, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.

Special service connection rules exist for Gulf War veterans. 38 U.S.C. § 1117; 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. The Southwest Asia theater of operations includes Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and the airspace above these locations. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e)(2). Under that section, service connection may be warranted for a Gulf War veteran who exhibits objective indications of a qualifying chronic disability that became manifest during active military, naval or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Gulf War. For disability due to undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness, the disability must have been manifest either during active military service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 31, 2026. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(1).

For purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.317, there are two types of qualifying chronic disabilities: (1) an undiagnosed illness; and (2) a diagnosed medically unexplained chronic multi-symptom illness (MUCMI) that is defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and functional gastrointestinal disorders (excluding gastrointestinal diseases).

An undiagnosed illness is defined as a condition that by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to a known clinical diagnosis. On the other hand, the term "MUCMI" refers to a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic MUCMIs of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, will not be considered "medically unexplained." Id.

Notwithstanding the foregoing presumption provisions, a claimant is not precluded from establishing service connection for a disability due to Gulf War exposures with proof of direct causation. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Ramey v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1996), aff'd sub nom, Ramey v. Gober, 120 F.3d 1239 (Fed. Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1171 (1998).

If a preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, "the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection. . . but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of the disorder. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). A preexisting condition will be considered to have been aggravated by service "where there is an increase in disability during service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is the result of the natural progress of the disease." 38 U.S.C. § 1153.  In such cases, the question of whether a preexisting defect or injury underwent an increase in severity "must be answered in the affirmative before the presumption of aggravation attaches."  Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529, 538 (1996).

It is the veteran who bears the burden of proof to show an increase in disability occurred in service. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096. If the veteran satisfies the burden, the preexisting condition will be presumed to have been aggravated by service. Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096. Once the presumption of aggravation has been established, the burden then shifts to the government to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in disability was a result of the natural progress of the disease. Id.; see also Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231 (2011).

"Clear and unmistakable evidence" is a more formidable evidentiary burden than the preponderance of the evidence standard. See Vanerson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 254, 258 (1999) (noting that the "'clear and convincing' burden of proof, while a higher standard than a preponderance of the evidence, is a lower burden to satisfy than 'clear and unmistakable evidence.'"). It is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the pre-existence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable." Cotant v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 116, 131 (2003), citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331, 334 (1993).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral pes planus, originally claimed as plantar fasciitis. See April 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is not warranted.

Turning to the relevant evidence, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that his feet were evaluated as normal, without any notation of pes planus, upon entrance into service. See January 1990 Report of Medical Examination. Thereafter, during his first period of service from April 1990 through May 1995, his STRs are silent for any foot-related complaints. At separation, his feet were again evaluated as normal, with a normal arch. See May 1995 Report of Medical Examination.

In June 1997, the Veteran underwent an entrance examination for the Army Reserve. Again, his feet were evaluated as normal, with a normal arch. See June 1997 Report of Medical Examination.

In January 2003, the Veteran underwent an entrance examination for another period of service. At this examination, he was evaluated as having mild, asymptomatic pes planus. See January 2003 Report of Medical Examination. Thereafter, during active duty, an in-service examination noted that the Veteran had bilateral, symptomatic pes planus. See January 2008 Report of Medical Examination. In the corresponding Report of Medical History, the Veteran reported foot trouble, which he described as current "slight foot pain" in his right heel. See December 2007 Report of Medical History.

Post-separation VA treatment records do not contain any complaints of foot pain or other foot issues.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in December 2022. The examiner noted a diagnosis of bilateral pes planus from January 2008. The Veteran reported that his foot condition had an onset in 2006, with symptoms throughout his military career. The examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition of plantar fasciitis was less likely than not related to service, based on the lack of a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis. The examiner did not provide an opinion for bilateral pes planus.  

The Veteran was afforded a Gulf War General Medical Examination in December 2022. He was noted to have flatfeet.

In February 2023, a VA medical opinion was provided regarding aggravation of the Veteran's pes planus. The examiner opined that the Veteran's pes planus, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to his period of service beginning January 2003, was not aggravated beyond its natural progression by the Veteran's military service. The examiner reasoned that there is no evidence of limited mobility, abnormal gait or stance, lower extremity weakness, or secondary changes in the surrounding bones and soft tissues. The examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's pes planus was described as asymptomatic and mild in January 2003, whereas in 2008 his pes planus was described as moderate and symptomatic, and the Veteran reported "slight foot pain" in his right heel which he believed came from "not having arch supports in my shoes when playing basketball." However, the examiner explained that this pain was a natural progression and there is no evidence that the military aggravated the condition. The Veteran's STRs did not otherwise contain any complaints of feet pain.

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded another VA medical examination. The examiner noted diagnoses of bilateral pes planus and plantar fasciitis from 2004. The Veteran reported that his condition began in 2004 or 2005. Specifically, he stated that "It began during my time as a Drill Sergeant in the Army and carried over when I became an Army instructor with [a] lot of trainings/marching, walking." The examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was less likely than not related to service. The examiner reasoned that there were no in-service complaints of pes planus.

The examiner also provided another opinion in January 2024, indicated that the bilateral pes planus was less likely than not related to service. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran had pes planus prior to and during service, and that there is no evidence of in-service worsening of the preexisting pes planus.

An addendum opinion by the same examiner was provided in February 2024 to address deficiencies in the December 2023 opinion (namely, that the Veteran's STRs did in fact contain complaints of pes planus during his 2005 to 2009 period of service). The examiner clarified that there was no evidence that the Veteran had pes planus in his first period of service from April 1990 to May 1995.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding a nexus to the Veteran's first period of service from April 1990 through May 1995. During this period (and two years afterwards in June 1997), the Veteran's feet were repeatedly evaluated as normal, with a normal arch. Taken together, the December 2023 and February 2024 medical opinions are probative evidence against a nexus, as they are adequate, supported by a rationale, and are consistent with the probative medical evidence of record. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). Indeed, the Veteran himself did not report that his pes planus began during this period: instead, he stated that his condition began sometime between 2004 and 2006, during his time as a Drill Sergeant. His military personnel records reflect that he was a Specialist at the time of his separation in May 1995, and was promoted to Drill Sergeant in January 2006. See May 1995 DD Form 214; January 2006 Record of Assignments.

The Board notes that the absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim, and the absence of evidence in the STRs is an insufficient basis, by itself, for a negative opinion. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Therefore, the Board is precluded from relying on an examiner's opinion premised solely on the absence of such evidence. In this instance, however, the Board finds the December 2023 and February 2024 VA opinions, when considered together, were not solely based on the absence of documented instances in the Veteran's STRs. When read in conjunction with the medical and lay evidence of record, along with the entirety of the medical reports themselves, the examiner based the opinions, not only on a lack of documentation in STRs but the sheer absence of anything in the record indicating pes planus between April 1990 through May 1995, even after considering the Veteran's lay reports. As noted above, the Veteran himself stated to the examiner that his foot condition began after this period of service, during his time as a Drill Sergeant.

It is not reasonably in dispute that the Veteran's bilateral pes planus preexisted his second period of active duty from September 2005 to December 2009. The condition was noted on his January 2003 entrance examination and, therefore, the presumption of soundness does not attach. However, service connection may be available for a preexisting disability that is aggravated in service. Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  

There is some evidence of an in-service increase in the disability. While the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was evaluated as asymptomatic in January 2003, later in January 2008 his pes planus was evaluated as symptomatic, and he reported "slight foot pain" in his right heel.

However, the Board finds that the evidence clearly and unmistakably that this increase in the Veteran's bilateral pes planus was the result of the natural progress of the condition. In a probative February 2023 VA opinion, a VA examiner specifically considered this evidence and persuasively explained that the Veteran's reported pain was a natural progression of pes planus. The examiner also explained that there is no evidence of limited mobility, abnormal gait or stance, lower extremity weakness, or secondary changes in the surrounding bones and soft tissues. There is no evidence of record or other medical opinion which tends to contradict these findings.

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for bilateral pes planus is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

2. Entitlement to service connection for CFS is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for CFS, specifically claimed as due to Gulf War toxic exposures. See April 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Veteran's STRs are negative for any complaints, symptoms, treatment, or diagnoses pertinent to CFS or a fatigue-related condition. 

Post-service, the Veteran's VA treatment records contain multiple notations of sleep issues. During an evaluation for OSA, he endorsed feeling tired and having excessive daytime sleepiness or fatigue. See May 2021 Sleep Medicine Consult Note. He was ultimately diagnosed with OSA. See November 2021 Sleep Medicine Note.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claim in October 2022. The examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of CFS. The Veteran described symptoms of headaches, joint pain, muscle aches, and restless sleep. The examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's claimed CFS was incurred in or related to service. She reasoned that he does not have a diagnosis of CFS and that his STRs are silent for any complaints of, or treatment for, CFS.

The Veteran underwent a Gulf War General Medical Examination in December 2022. The examiner clarified that CFS is considered an undiagnosed illness. The examiner did not indicate that the Veteran has CFS. The examiner also noted that the Veteran does not have any additional signs or symptoms that may represent an undiagnosed illness or a diagnosed MUCMI.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination for his claim in December 2023. The examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of CFS. The Veteran described symptoms of erratic sleep patterns, mood swings, profound fatigue, headaches, weakness, muscle pain, joint pain, insomnia, and depression. The examiner provided a TERA opinion, indicating that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERAs after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that there is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis or condition that can be related to the claimed toxic exposure.

The Veteran is not competent to diagnose CFS nor is he competent to link a fatigue disorder to service. This issue is medically complex, and outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that he has the medical training or credentials necessary to make such a determination. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 307 ("lay persons are not competent to opine as to medical etiology or render medical opinions").

Based on the above evidence, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran had a diagnosis of CFS or other fatigue disorder at any time during the pendency of the appeal. Three different VA examiners indicated that the Veteran does not have a CFS diagnosis. Additionally, based on a Gulf War General Medical Examination, one of these VA examiners indicated that the Veteran does not have any other undiagnosed illness or a diagnosed MUCMI. The Veteran's post-service medical treatment records reflected sleepiness and fatigue attributable to his diagnosed OSA. Therefore, for purposes of the CFS claim, there is no competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability.

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for CFS is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

3. Entitlement to service connection for GERD is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for GERD, claimed as due to exposure to burn pits, diesel fumes, and smoke. See April 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is not warranted.

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made multiple favorable findings. Pertinent here, the AOJ found that (1) the Veteran has a current disability based on his diagnosis of GERD, (2) the Veteran was exposed to particulate matter during military service, and (3) the Veteran served in Southwest Asia. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Thus, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's GERD is related to service, to include his conceded TERA.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, the Veteran's throat, chest, and abdomen were clinically evaluated as normal upon entrance to his first period of service and at all in-service examinations thereafter. See January 1990 Report of Medical Examination; May 1995 Report of Medical Examination; June 1997 Report of Medical Examination; January 2003 Report of Medical Examination; January 2008 Report of Medical Examination. Within the corresponding Reports of Medical History, he denied experiencing any symptoms related to GERD. There were no complaints, diagnoses, or treatment for GERD or reflux issues in his STRs.

The Veteran's post-separation VA treatment records do not contain any complaints of GERD or reflux issues.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination pertaining to this claim in October 2022, during which he was diagnosed with GERD. The Veteran reported that his condition began in 2011, with symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, reflux, and sleep disturbance. The examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not related to service, reasoning that there were no complaints of, or treatment for, GERD in the Veteran's STRs.

The Veteran was afforded a Gulf War General Medical Examination in December 2022. The examiner indicated that the Veteran's claimed GERD is a disease with a clear and specific etiology and diagnosis.

Regarding TERA, a February 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERA after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that "There is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis or condition that can be related to the claimed toxic exposure."

The AOJ found that the February 2023 TERA opinion is insufficient because it was based on the lack of a diagnosis, whereas the Veteran was in fact diagnosed with GERD. See May 2023 VA Form 20-0999.

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination for GERD. The examiner confirmed a diagnosis of GERD. The Veteran reported that his condition began in 2007 or 2008, with symptoms of nausea, bloating, dry cough, clearing throat, and burning chest pain. The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not caused by the indicated TERAs after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran. The examiner reasoned that there is no relationship between GERD and the Veteran's Gulf War toxic exposures, including burn pits.

The Board finds that the October 2022 and December 2023 VA opinions are probative, as they are adequate, supported by a rationale, and are consistent with the medical evidence of record. See Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 123; Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. When considered together and with the entire evidence of record, the Board finds the examination reports adequate for adjudication of the Veteran's service connection claim because they are based upon an accurate medical history and provide explanations that contain clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; see also Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 312. 

Based on the above, the Board finds the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding a nexus. The probative October 2022 and December 2023 VA opinions indicated that the Veteran's diagnosed GERD is less likely that not related to active service, to include his conceded TERA exposure. Notably, there are no positive opinions of record for consideration. None of the Veteran's STRs support an onset of GERD or related symptoms during service. Rather, it was not until 2022 that the Veteran was first diagnosed with GERD. 

While the Veteran has contended that his GERD began during service, the Board finds he is not competent to offer a nexus opinion as it requires specialized knowledge and training. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 n.4; Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 307. Instead, the Board relies upon the competent and probative medical evidence of record, including the October 2022 VA medical opinion. Further, the Board finds the Veteran's report of onset during service in 2007 or 2008 is not substantiated by the January 2008 in-service examination and corresponding Report of Medical History, and it is inconsistent with his earlier statement that the condition began in 2011, which was after active duty.

Regarding TERA specifically, the Board finds the December 2023 VA examiner's opinion to be highly probative. The examiner considered the Veteran's conceded TERAs, including exposure to burn pits, and explained that there is no relationship between GERD and the Veteran's TERAs.

The Board notes that the January 2024 rating decision included a favorable finding that the claimed disability is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service as a MUCMI. Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms may be manifestations of an undiagnosed illness. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(b). However, GERD is specifically not a MUCMI and, instead is a "structural gastrointestinal disease" excluded from 3.317 consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a)(2)(i)(B). Further, it is a diagnosed condition with a clear etiology, as was specifically clarified in the December 2022 VA Gulf War General Medical Examination. The December 2022 VA examiner also indicated that the Veteran does not have any other signs or symptoms that may represent an undiagnosed illness or MUCMI.

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for GERD is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA is remanded.

This matter must be remanded to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. Specifically, the AOJ failed to obtain adequate VA medical opinions for the theories of direct service connection and secondary service connection.

The Veteran had submitted a statement from his spouse, in which she stated that she witnessed him overlook health problems during his military service and that he has sleep issues, including loud snoring and frequent awakening. See July 2022 VA Form 21-4138. A VA treatment record indicated that his wife has noticed his "loud snoring for years" especially in the last seven years. See May 2021 Sleep Medicine Consult. During a December 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his sleep condition began in service (in 2007 or 2008) and that he noticed it when his wife began complaining about his increased snoring. The VA examiner diagnosed him with OSA and provided a TERA opinion for OSA. However, no VA medical opinion was obtained regarding whether the Veteran's OSA began in service.

The pre-decisional record has reasonably raised the additional theory of entitlement that the Veteran's OSA is secondary to his service-connected back disability, with obesity as an intermediate step. In his application for service connection, the Veteran stated his belief that he gained excessive weight due to an inability to exercise properly after the "wear and tear" on his body during military service, and that in turn this weight gain caused OSA. See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. While obesity in and of itself is not a disability that can be service connected, it may qualify as an "intermediate step" between a service-connected disability and a current disability where a claimant establishes that the obesity was caused by a service-connected disability and caused the current disability. See VA OGC Prec. Op. 1-2017; see also Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300 (2020) (holding that obesity may also service an intermediate step predicated on secondary aggravation). Here, at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities included lumbosacral strain. See January 2024 Rating Decision. Thus, the AOJ should have obtained a secondary service connection opinion for OSA in relation to lumbosacral strain, to specifically include consideration of obesity as an intermediate step.

In light of the evidence in the claims file at the time of the January 2024 rating decision, including the Veteran's assertion of an in-service onset, remand is warranted to obtain a VA medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's OSA had an onset in service or is otherwise related to service, and whether the Veteran's OSA is secondarily service connected to his back disability.

While the Board is remanding this matter at this time for a VA medical opinion, the Board is mindful of the holding in Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332 (2020), and the impact of implicit credibility determinations within remand orders. The Board does not at this time make any determinations regarding the credibility of any evidence currently of record, to include those described in this remand.

2. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction, including as secondary to OSA, is remanded.

The Veteran contends he has erectile dysfunction that is related to service, or in the alternative is secondary to OSA. See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Board finds remand is necessary as this claim is inextricably intertwined with the remanded service connection claim for OSA. Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).

3. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including as secondary to erectile dysfunction, is remanded.

The Veteran contends he has an acquired psychiatric disorder that is related to service, or in the alternative is secondary to erectile dysfunction. See July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Board finds remand is necessary as this claim is inextricably intertwined with the remanded service connection claim for erectile dysfunction. Harris, 1 Vet. App. at 183.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a VA medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the etiology of the Veteran's OSA. The need for an additional in-person examination is left to the discretion of the clinician writing the opinion. Following review of the claims file, the clinician is asked to address the following:

(a.) Determine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's OSA had an onset in service or is otherwise related to his active service.

(b.) Alternatively, determine whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral disability caused him to become obese, or aggravated his obesity, and if so:

i.	Whether it is at least as likely as not that the obesity or aggravation of obesity as a result of the service-connected lumbosacral disability was a substantial factor in causing OSA; and,

ii.	Whether it is at least as likely as not that OSA would not have occurred but for the obesity caused or aggravated by the service-connected lumbosacral disability.

NOTE: It is "but for" causation or aggravation that is required, not proximate cause. Specifically, would the Veteran have developed OSA, or would his OSA have been less severe, but for the service-connected lumbosacral disability?

If the examiner opines that there is aggravation, the examiner should provide an opinion about the baseline severity before aggravation.

The clinician must specifically address and discuss (1) the Veteran's statements during the December 2023 VA examination for sleep apnea, in which he reported an in-service onset of his sleep condition, (2) his spouse's July 2022 lay statement, and (3) a May 2021 VA treatment record indicating that the Veteran's spouse has noticed his loud snoring for years.

The clinician is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports should be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion. If the Veteran's reports are discounted, the clinician should provide a rationale for doing so (e.g., whether there is any medical reason to accept or reject his contentions).

If medical literature is relied upon, the clinician should identify and specifically cite each reference material used. The clinician should specifically discuss any contradictory evidence in the claims file and reconcile that evidence with their findings.

All opinions should be accompanied by supporting rationale explaining how the clinician arrived at the conclusions expressed. 

If the clinician determines that s/he cannot provide an opinion without resorting to speculation, s/he should explain the inability to provide an opinion, identifying precisely what facts could not be determined. In particular, s/he should comment on whether an opinion could not be provided because the limits of medical knowledge have been exhausted or whether additional testing or information could be obtained that would lead to a conclusive opinion.
