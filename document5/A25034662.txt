ORDER

2. The Veteran became permanently and totally disabled for purposes of basic eligibility to DEA benefits on October 3, 2021. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder and anxious distress (previously rated as adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct with history of alcohol abuse) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.307, 3.40.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Navy from January 2011 to January 2014. 

This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 Regional Office (RO) rating decision.

In the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the appellant elected the Direct Review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Earlier Effective Dates

Effective dates for claims seeking an increased rating for an already service-connected disability that are based on an original claim, or a claim for increase will be the day of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. However, the effective date may also be the earliest date as of which it is "factually ascertainable" that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from the date of the increase, based on a review of the entire evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); see also Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Swanson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 442 (1999).

In determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim for the increased rating as well as (2) a review of all the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable." See Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of a 100 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder and anxious distress (previously rated as adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct with history of alcohol abuse)

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the grant of his 100 percent rating for PTSD and the grant of DEA benefits. Specifically, the Veteran asserts that a January 30, 2014, effective date is warranted. 

The initially assigned effective date, represents the date of the Veterans intent to file, October 3, 2021. The Veteran underwent an examination for his PTSD in September 2022. This examination was where it was determined that the evidence first reflected that the severity of the Veterans PTSD most closely approximated the criteria for a 100 percent disability rating. 

There is no evidence to show such an increase in the Veterans disability before the September 2022 examination. In addition, the claim file does not contain a private examination or opinion indicating an increased in disability before that time.

In order to assign an earlier effective date, the Board would have to find evidence that an increase in the Veteran's disability was factually ascertainable in the year preceding his intent to file. No such evidence exists here. Absent such evidence, the Board has no legal mechanism to assign an effective date earlier than October 3, 2021, the date of the Veteran's Intent to File.

The Board recognizes the Veterans representative's argument that the effective date should be January 30, 2014, as the Veterans VR & E counseling record qualifies as new and relevant evidence submitted as a timely appeal for his increased rating for PTSD. As well as a possibility of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability TDIU. 

However, the Board disagrees. A claimant may file a supplemental claim by submitting or identifying new and relevant evidence. New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Relevant evidence means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim. (38 CFR §3.2501). A claimant may continuously pursue a claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim." Timely" means the supplemental claim is submitted within one year of the VA decision." Properly" means VA form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, is completed and submitted along with new and relevant evidence. (38 CFR §3.2500, 38 CFR §3.2501)

In this case, the Veteran submitted an intent to file on October 3, 2021, followed by a formal claim for an increased rating for PTSD in February 2022. The increase for his PTSD was then granted as of the date of receipt of his intent to file. Absent factually ascertainable evidence of an increase in the Veteran's disability in the year preceding this Intent to File, no earlier effective date is warranted.

In sum, the Board is bound by the laws governing the assignment of effective dates. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c). In applying said laws to the current fact pattern, the Board finds no basis upon which to award an earlier effective date in this case; there is no doubt to be resolved; and an earlier effective date than October 3, 2021, for the 100 percent evaluation assigned for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is not warranted.

Regarding the earlier effective date for an award of basic eligibility for DEA, Chapter 35 benefits, DEA benefits are payable to the child, spouse, or surviving spouse of a Veteran if the following conditions are met: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a), 21.3021.

The Veteran was awarded basic eligibility to DEA benefits, effective October 3, 2021, the date which he totally disabled due to his PTSD.

There are other avenues through which basic eligibility may be granted. However, they involve factors not applicable here, e.g., the death of a Veteran or if a Veteran is currently on active duty.

As eligibility for DEA benefits is predicated on a finding of permanent and total disability in this case and permanent and total disability has been found from October 3, 2021, an effective date earlier than October 3, 2021, is not warranted for entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA benefits.
