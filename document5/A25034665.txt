ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for thoracolumbar spine with degenerative arthritis, intervertebral disc syndrome and spinal stenosis ("back conditions") is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's back conditions are the result of his active-duty service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for back conditions have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2001 to November 2004. 

The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying the Veteran's claim for service connection for his back conditions secondary to his service-connected pes planus in March 2021, which constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The AOJ issued another rating decision in April 2021 for the limited purpose of explaining additional favorable findings that were not included in the March 2021 rating decision.

In May 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for his back conditions most recently addressed in the March and April 2021 rating decisions.  In June 2021, AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

On February 18, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2005 decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). A VA Form 20-0996 cannot be used to seek review of a decision issued 16 years prior, so the AOJ processed this as a request for HLR of the June 2021 rating decision. In March 2022, the AOJ issued a HLR decision, found that a duty-to-assist error had been made in the June 2021 rating decision; specifically, "fail[ing] to get an examination(s) and/or medical opinion(s)" and returned the claim for further development, transferring it to the supplemental claim lane.

While the further development was pending, on April 5, 2022, the Veteran submitted another HLR request for (1) the March 2022 HLR decision for "arbitrary and capricious, abuse of discretion errors" and "non-adjudicated CUEs," and (2) an August 2005 rating decision for "multiple CUEs." 

On May 4, 2022, VA notified the Veteran by letter that the March 10, 2022 decision "was the result of the VA Form 20-0996 [HLR] received on February 18, 2022. You cannot submit a HLR on a previously decided HLR.. The issues mentioned above are although being looked at for any possible Clear and Unmistakable Errors (CUEs) that you will be notified of in a separate notification. This letter effectively rejected the HLR Request and accepted the CUE motion for the August 2005 decision.

On May 4, 2022, the AOJ issued a decision, stating that a "special review of your file was mandated on February 18, 2022." The AOJ found no CUE in the August 2005 rating decision denying service connection for the Veteran's back condition.

Following the completion of the additional development of the claim after the March 2022 HLR return, the AOJ issued a decision on May 26, 2022 continuing the denial of the Veteran's claim for service connection for his back conditions.

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for his back conditions as "directly related to service," and listed the date of VA decision notice as May 5, 2005. 

In October 2022, the AOJ issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received to reconsider the claim for service connection for back conditions, and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted another HLR request, and requested review of the October 2022 decision for "low back" and "earlier effective date of low back (11/10/2004)." 

On December 3, 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2022 decision and confirmed and continued the denial of service connection for the back conditions.  

In the December 5, 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket for the appeal of the December 3, 2022 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2022 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Except as noted below, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist in the December 2022 rating decision on appeal. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board . . . to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to duty-to-assist argument).

The Board acknowledges that the issue specified in the December 2022 VA Form 10182 is "CUE: Lower back directly related to service," with the rating decision on appeal being the December 2022 HLR decision. The Board also acknowledges the multiple CUE arguments that the Veteran has made through his representative in briefs and during HLR informal conferences. 

However, a CUE claim was not adjudicated in the December 2022 decision. His April 5, 2022 claim of CUE in an August 2005 rating decision was denied in the May 4, 2022 decision. The May 2022 rating decision was not identified on the VA Form 10182, nor was the August 2005 rating decision.

To the extent the Veteran was attempting to file a motion to revise the December 2022 rating decision based on CUE, the December 2022 VA Form 10182 is insufficient for that purpose. CUE may only be asserted in a determination that has become final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. As the December 2022 decision was only 2 days old at the time of appeal, the one year period had not passed for it to become final and subject to CUE. Moreover, the pending appeal to the Board of the December 2022 decision has kept the decision from becoming final. Therefore, the December 2022 decision was not subject to a motion for CUE.

Further, CUE is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the results would have been manifestly different but for the error. See Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir.) (holding that in order to prove the existence of clear and unmistakable error, a claimant must show that an error occurred that was outcome-determinative; that is, an error that would manifestly have changed the outcome of the prior decision). It is further noted that any claim of CUE must be pled with specificity. Andre v. West, 14 Vet. App. 7, 10 (2000) (per curiam), aff'd sub nom. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002). This specific allegation must assert more than mere disagreement with how the facts of the case were weighed or evaluated. In other words, to present a valid claim of CUE the claimant cannot simply request that the Board reweigh or reevaluate the evidence. Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412 (1996). In order to demonstrate CUE, the evidence must show that the law was incorrectly applied to the facts as they were known at the time and that, had the error not occurred, the decision would have been manifestly different. 

The Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate a CUE motion where the motion has not already been addressed by the AOJ, and the AOJ has not addressed the issue of CUE in the December 2022 rating decision. 

Therefore, the only back disability-related claim that could be appealed from the December 2022 rating decision is entitlement to service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Entitlement to service connection for back conditions

The Veteran contends that his back conditions are due to his military service. He asserts service connection both on the direct basis that his back disability began in service and also on a secondary basis as having been caused by his service-connected pes planus. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection is also warranted for disability due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Such secondary service connection is warranted for any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disability that is due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding all that is needed is a "but for" causation or aggravation to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

Additionally, for Veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including arthritis, are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. 

Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing continuity of symptomatology after service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). However, the use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) and does not apply to other disabilities which might be considered chronic from a medical standpoint. See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 263-64 (2015). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The December 2022 rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's back conditions for lack of an in-service event or incurrence, finding that "there is no documentation in [the Veteran's] service medical records of treatment for, complaints of or a diagnosis of a back condition in service or that the presumptive condition manifested to a compensable degree within one year of military service." In the December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and intervertebral disc syndrome; that the Veteran's diagnosis of degenerative arthritis is a recognized presumptive disability under 38 C.F.R. 3.309; that the Veteran has sufficient service to meet the minimum requirement for presumptive service connection; that his claimed condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more following service; and that the claimed primary disability of pes planus is service-connected. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent as to documented complaints of back problems. In the Veteran's report of medical history at separation from service in August 2004, he answered that he had no history of any medical problems, including recurrent back pain or back problems, but also including foot problems and knee trouble. The Veteran's separation exam noted everything as "normal" except for his feet which were noted as having moderate, symptomatic pes planus. The Veteran's service records reflect that he was put on a weight management program and ultimately separated from service due to being unable to meet the fitness standards.

The Veteran has been afforded multiple VA examinations regarding his back conditions since filing his first service-connection claim for lower back pain in November 2004, 21 days after his separation from service. 

In an August 2005 examination, the VA examiner noted the Veteran's reports that the onset of his back problems had been in 2004, when 

he began to notice lower back pain with running greater than 2.5 miles and/or standing for more than an hour. he sought treatment and had xrays, treated with Motrin. Apparently the xrays were normal and the medication did not eliminate the pain. He is not under medical care at this time for this condition.

The August 2005 VA examiner diagnosed him with a "chronic lumbar strain" that had been "stable" since noting that it had significant occupational effects as well as effects on daily activities, including exercise, sports, and recreation. Diagnostic x-rays were performed in connection with the August 2005 examination, which found that his "lumbar vertebrae [were] normal in alignment with no evidence of recent body injury or other defect. The disc spaces, neural foramina and vertebral appendages [were] unremarkable." The August 2005 VA examiner was not asked to render a medical opinion as to the relation between the Veteran's back disability and his military service. 

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination in March 2021, which noted diagnoses of degenerative arthritis, intervertebral disc syndrome, spinal stenosis, and bilateral lumbar radiculopathy - sciatica, giving 3/24/21 (the date of the examination) as the date of diagnosis for all four diagnoses. The Veteran reported the following regarding the history of his back conditions:

pain in lower back since 2004.- during physical training. he states weigh[]ing 250lbs and despite going to nutritionist in attempt to lose wt. since it was suggested that his wt may be contributing to back, knee issues. at the same time he was dealing with foot pain diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. for back pain in 2020 he had mri and had steroid injection without help.  has also tried PT.  currently he takes advil, ibuprofen.  also reports shooting pain from lower back to both legs.  as well as numbness is felt is lower back only.   

The March 2021 VA examiner was asked to render a medical opinion on the issue of whether the Veteran's back conditions were the result of his service-connected pes planus disability. Considering that during his military service the Veteran was "sent to nutritionist [with] who[m] he discussed having back issues and it was recommended that he improved his nutrition and lose [weight] to decrease stress on his joints, as reported per claimant," the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's back conditions were less likely than not due to his service-connected pes planus, with the following rationale:

Based on evidence reviewed, lack of evidence documenting back issues throughout his act[ive] duty service, the time when his lower back would be at highest stress /strain due to physical activities and the fact that he was 250lbs requiring nutrition counseling, I believe that all this evidence or the lack of points to being overweight as the most likely source causing strain on his lower back that[,] over[ ]time[,] despite not having suffered a traumatic event during act[ive] duty, caused minor stress of his lower back that eventually manifested as noted on mri findings dated 3/2/20.

In March 2022, the AOJ also obtained medical opinions addressing whether the Veteran's service-connected pes planus caused or aggravated his back conditions, including via obesity as an intermediate factor. The March 2022 VA examiner rendered negative nexus opinions regarding secondary causation or aggravation, noting "no objective evidence" showing that his back conditions were caused or aggravated by the pes planus, with the following rationale: 

Medical documents in the e-file show the vet has normal gait and ambulation. The medical literature is controversial regarding secondary causes of musculoskeletal biomechanical degenerative changes and is based on empirical evidence and not on randomly controlled double blind studies. Observation of veteran's gait in numerous documents reveals that it is not antalgic and it is not biomechanically altered. There is no evidence of chronic changes in gait, ambulation, weight bearing or stance attributable to the feet that would somehow lead to chronic back problems as claimed.

The examiner further explained that "[t]he obesity cannot, in any objective or reproducible medical manner[,] be linked to the foot conditions and this question [of obesity as an intermediate cause] therefore cannot in any way be objectively answered."

Another VA examination in September 2022 noted diagnoses of degenerative arthritis with a diagnosis date of May 2021; lumbosacral strain with a diagnosis date of 2004; and intervertebral disc syndrome and lumbosacral radiculopathy bilateral lower extremities with a diagnosis date of September 2022. The VA examiner noted the Veteran's reports of lower back stiffness and pain beginning in 2004 during physical training. Regarding the course of his back conditions since onset, the Veteran reported that "[t]he condition has worsened. I have a shooting pain that radiates down from my back towards both legs. It comes at random points throughout the day, along with numbness and tingling." The Veteran also reported muscle spasms, "daily soreness," and "a grinding noise" in his back.

The September 2022 VA examiner rendered a positive nexus opinion, finding that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current back conditions were the result of his military service based on the Veteran's reports that "he injured his back in 2004 during physical training. This has persisted to present, consistent with imaging and records." 

The Veteran also submitted private medical opinions in support of his claim, including a nexus letter from Dr. D.B., dated May 2021. After review of the Veteran's C-file, service records, as well as his current medical records, Dr. D.B. rendered a positive nexus with the following rationale: 

Because of [the Veteran's] service acquired Pes Planus and Plantar Fasciitis, [the Veteran] has accommodated to the pain in his feet by shifting his weight from his left and right side. In doing so, [the Veteran] has disrupted the top of the lower extremity kinetic chain (the lumbar spine). It is well known throughout the medical community that the foot can affect the lumbar spine and I have provided 2 well-sourced studies that explain and support my rationale and this claim. It is with this Nexus letter, I hope the VA will grant [the Veteran] a C&P examination based off potential service-related causation.

The Veteran also submitted a medical opinion by Dr. E.C. in July 2022, who gave the following opinion:

Based on the medical analysis herein and on corroborating evidence, it is my expert opinion that it is more likely than not, and in fact it is highly probable, that [the Veteran]'s lumbar IVDS is linked to service and/or aggravated by his other medical conditions related to his service. The corroborating evidence is [the Veteran]'s circumstances of service, service treatment records, and symptoms testified to by the Veteran, and others, in addition to peer-reviewed medical studies and treatises...

The Board notes, however, that Dr. E.C. incorrectly characterizes some of the evidence of record, insofar as he indicates that "the Veteran was diagnosed with lumbar IVDS and associated radiculopathy and peripheral neuritis . . . 21 days after service." 

On review, the Board finds that the Veteran's reports to the VA medical examiners are consistent with his service records, which show that he was put on a weight management program in an attempt to lose weight to meet the fitness standards. The Veteran has consistently reported back pain that began during physical training in service. Although the Veteran indicated in his report of medical history at separation that he had no history of back problems, he also reported no history of foot or knee problems. The Veteran is now service-connected for pes planus, and his service treatment records include complaints of knee and foot pain, so the Board does not find the lack of reported back problems in his separation report of medical history to be probative. The Veteran is competent to report when his back conditions began, and medical examiners have opined that his description of the condition is consistent with medical evidence of record.

Therefore, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's back conditions began during service. The claim is granted.
