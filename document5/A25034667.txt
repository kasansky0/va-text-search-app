?

FINDING OF FACT

Following the initial denial of original claim number 302104500034008000, based on untimely filing, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively reprocessed under new claim number 302121720052595000, and approved partial payment of $1,537.64, for the dental services provided by the appellant to the Veteran on February 22, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA dental services provided on February 22, 2020, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1983 to July 1984.

The appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished dental services to the Veteran on February 22, 2020.???

In April 2021, VA received a notice of disagreement (NOD) from the appellant, electing the Direct Review docket, and requesting review of a February 2021 AOJ Explanation of Payment (EOP) that rejected a claim for the cost of dental services provided to the Veteran.  

The appellant's original claim number 302104500034008000 for $1,934.00 was initially denied in February 2021 due to untimely filing.  However, the appellant was sent a new EOP statement in August 2021, reflecting that the claim was reprocessed under new claim number 302121720052595000, with partial payment of $1,537.64, made on August 12, 2021, EFT number 1818503.

The Board acknowledges that the payment is less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the dental services provided were disagreeable to the appellant, they were required to file a separate appeal of the latter August 2021 decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the episode of care on February 22, 2020, constitutes a reversal of the February 2021 denial, and a full grant of the benefits sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.
