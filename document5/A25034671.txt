CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include tension and migraine, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 511, 7104; 5104C; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103, 20.104, 20.105, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 2017 to March 2022.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which denied the claim on appeal.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ/RO) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ/RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

By way of procedural background, the Veteran initially submitted a claim for service connection in September 2022, which included a claim for headaches. A rating decision was issued in January 2023, which denied the claim as it neither incurred in nor was caused by the Veteran's military service. In a January 2023 notification letter, the Veteran was informed that he had one year from the date of the notification letter to file one of the following forms if he disagreed with the decision: (1) VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim; (2) VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review; or (3) VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.

As listed above, in January 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for migraine. In a January 2024 letter, VA informed the Veteran that the claim for migraines, also claimed as tension headaches was previously denied and a proper form was required. 

In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for migraine (headaches). In an April 2024 letter, VA informed the Veteran that the claim for migraines (headaches) was previously denied and a proper form was required. 

In August 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, seeking service connection for migraine (headaches). In a September 2024 letter, VA informed the Veteran that the claim for migraines (tension headaches) was previously denied and a proper form was required. 

The Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (10182/NOD) in September 2024, seeking review of the claim. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's January 2023 rating decision became final as the Veteran did not appeal the decision and no additional evidence was received within a year of the denial. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. While the Veteran continued to file claims, a continuously pursued claim is one in which a timely and properly administrative review option is filed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). As the January 2023 rating decision was issued following an initial claim, "the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals." 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c)(1). Because the Veteran did not seek a supplemental review, a request for a higher-level review, or a timely appeal to the Board, the January 2023 rating decision became final. 

As such, the claim for headache, to include tension and migraine, is not properly before the Board for adjudication.

The claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches, to include tension and migraine.

As noted above, the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement (10182/NOD) in September 2024, seeking review of the claim for service connection for headaches. 

In Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that in the modernized review system, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a), a claimant may file more than one administrative review request within one year of an initial AOJ/RO decision on a claim, provided that such an administrative review request is not pending concurrently with another administrative review request. Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). 

In other words, the Veteran in this case, could have requested Board review (NOD, VA Form 10182) of the January 2023 decision on the merits and the NOD could have potentially been submitted within one year of the decision. In this case, however, the Veteran failed to file a VA Form 10182 as it pertains to the January 2023 rating decision. Accordingly, the holding in Terry is not applicable in this case. Instead, the Veteran is now seeking to appeal the January 2023 rating decision. The Veteran has not sought a request for extension or shown good cause as to why this appeal to the Board was not timely.  

VA regulations unequivocally provide that, except in limited circumstances (which do not apply here), a notice of disagreement (NOD, VA Form 10182) must be submitted to the AOJ/RO within one year of the rating decision being appealed. A NOD must identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein with which the claimant disagrees. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue(s) therein. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

Additionally, VA regulations provide clear recourse in circumstances when a filing extension is required at 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c), which allows for an extension to be granted "for good cause" if the request is offered in writing and submitted to the Board.

The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the VA Form 10182 in this case. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b), when an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. This has not occurred here as the Veteran has not sought or inferred a request for a waiver or an extension of time to file his appeal with the Board.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the VA Form 10182 was untimely and good cause is not found. Accordingly, the Board finds a timely Notice of Disagreement was not filed as to the January 2023 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(C); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.303 (b).

Therefore, the appeal of the January 2023 rating decision as to the issue of headache, to include tension and migraine, is not properly before the Board and must be dismissed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.
