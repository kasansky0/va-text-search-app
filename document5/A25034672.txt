ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his lumbar spine disability is etiologically related to active duty service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 2013 to March 2015. His decorations include the National Defense Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 higher-level review rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) which continued the denial of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability. In September 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and chose the Direct Review docket.

As the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In determining whether service connection is warranted, the Board shall consider the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. That is, the claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in "approximate" balance, i.e., "nearly equal," but does not require that the evidence be in exact equipoise. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is granted.

In the July 2024 higher-level review rating decision on appeal, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current disability; he has been diagnosed with lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome to include degenerative disc disease and arthritis. As the evidence of record supports this finding, the Board finds that it is not clearly and unmistakably erroneous and may not disturb it. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).   

The Board finds that the Veteran, as lay person, is competent to speak to manifestations or symptoms of back pain. He is competent to express those observable symptoms of his disability, here back pain, as he has throughout the claims period. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). Under certain circumstances, lay statements may support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability, or symptoms of disability, susceptible of lay observation. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). Here, the Board finds that back pain is the type of medical condition which a normal lay person can competently attest to. Further, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements concerning the onset of this pain while in basic and physical training on ruck runs is consistent with the situations, circumstances, and hardships of active duty service as an infantryman. Thus, the Board finds that the second element of service connection, an in-service event, injury, or disease, has also been met. 

The Board now turns to whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's current lumbar spine disability and the exercises and activity during basic and physical training. To that end, the Board acknowledges the presence of a negative nexus opinion provided in January 2024. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's current lumbar spine disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service, as his service treatment records are silent for complaint, treatment, or diagnosis of low back pain, and he was first diagnosed with a lumbar disability in June 2021. However, the Board finds that this opinion is inadequate, as the VA examiner does not address the Veteran's competent, credible lay statement that his back pain began in service during basic and physical training and has progressively worsened since that time. See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 257 (2020) (a VA examiner must address the Veteran's lay statements to provide the Board with an adequate medical opinion). 

The Board also acknowledges the presence of two positive opinions dated June 2021 and January 2022 from private medical providers who found that the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is etiologically related to his in-service military occupational specialty. However, these opinions are conclusory as they do not contain any rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning). 

The Board could remand the claim for another VA opinion but a request for another opinion could be construed as obtaining additional evidence for the sole purpose of denying a claim, which is impermissible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(c) ("The development of evidence in connection with claims for service connection will be accomplished when deemed necessary but it should not be undertaken when evidence present is sufficient for this determination"). The Board finds that the current evidence is sufficient to decide the Veteran's claim. Given the current diagnosis of lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome to include degenerative disc disease and arthritis, the Veteran's competent, credible statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since service, and the lack of documentation or evidence of an intercurrent cause, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for a lumbar spine disability is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claim is granted.
