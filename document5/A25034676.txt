REMANDED

The issue of whether the character of the Appellant's discharge from service is a bar to entitlement to VA benefits, exclusive of health care and related benefits authorized under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Appellant served on active duty from February 2, 2012 to July 23, 2014; the character of his service is the subject of this appeal. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In May 2022, the Appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issue of whether his character of discharge from service is a bar to entitlement to VA benefits, exclusive of health care and related benefits authorized under Chapter 17, Title 38, United States Code (Chapter 17). This issue was most recently addressed in an April 2016 administrative decision. In May 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental decision on appeal.

In the November 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Appellant elected the direct review docket. As such, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the decision on appeal (May 23, 2022). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. Because these matters are being remanded, any evidence that is not considered by the Board at this time will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) upon readjudication of this claim.

As an initial matter, the Board notes the Appellant did not appeal the April 2016 administrative decision which determined that his period of service from February 2, 2012 to July 23, 2014 was dishonorable for VA purposes. However, in May 2016, service personnel records that existed at the time but were not considered in the 2016 administrative decision have been associated with the claims file. The Board finds these service department records are relevant to the issue of the characterization of the Appellant's military service. Therefore, new and relevant evidence is not necessary to reconsider the issue of whether the character of discharge is a bar to VA benefits, and the administrative decision will be reconsidered. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). 

The Board finds that remand is appropriate to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty that has a reasonable possibility of substantiating the Appellant's claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 3.12, which governs eligibility to VA benefits based on the character of a claimant's discharge, was amended effective June 25, 2024. 89 Fed. Reg. 32361 (2024). The Supplementary Information to this regulatory change states that "When this rule becomes effective, any claimant with a prior unfavorable COD determination, to include the no longer used undesirable discharge, may request a new COD determination under new §?3.12." 

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that a new character of discharge determination must be issued under the revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.12.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Issue a new character of discharge determination under the revised provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.12.
