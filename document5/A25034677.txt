DOCKET NO. 240531-444305
DATE:  April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

On June 18, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received written notification from the Veteran indicating that they wanted to withdraw this appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38?U.S.C. ยง?7105 (2018); 38?C.F.R. ยง?20.205 (2024). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by their authorized representative. In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn their appeal and so, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
