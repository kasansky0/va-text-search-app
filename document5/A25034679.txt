ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not timely file a VA Form 10182, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182 with respect to the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) system is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400; 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 2004 to April 2006 and from March 2009 to September 2009.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2023 and October 2023 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran appealed the rating decisions by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  Under direct review, the Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2019).  Therefore, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of October 10, 2023, the date of the notification letter for the October 2023 rating decision.  Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

The Veteran attempted to appeal the August 2023 rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 on August 26, 2024.  The Veteran, in pertinent part, listed that he was appealing the August 23, 2023, rating decision that denied the claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.  The Veteran was notified of that decision on August 24, 2023.  The August 26, 2024 VA Form 10182 Board appeal was submitted more than one year after notification of the August 2023 denial, which renders the appeal untimely under either the legacy or AMA framework.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.203.  

Neither the Veteran nor his attorney has provided an explanation as to why the August 26, 2024 VA Form 10182 was filed more than one year after notification of the rating decision. Indeed, the Veteran filed two other VA Form 10182s in June 2024 for different issues that the Veteran believed should have been addressed in the August 2023 rating decision; yet he did not include an appeal as to bilateral hearing loss on those forms.  

As proper claims processing rules have not been followed, the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss under the AMA system is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 20.104.

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is remanded.

Regarding the Veteran's claims for service connection, it does not appear that the Veteran's military personnel record is complete.  Specifically, the Veteran served two periods of active duty in the Army, from March 2003 to September 2003 and from October 2004 to April 2006.  See March 2023 Service Record (SR).  However, only the Veteran's first period of active duty VA Form DD 214 has been associated with his claims file.  See March 2023 Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty; August 2023 DPRIS Response.  Given that the AOJ failed to obtain complete military personnel records, and this was prior to the decision on the claim, the Board finds that this is a pre-decisional duty to assist error warranting remand under the AMA and implementing regulations.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Accordingly, remand is necessary to afford the AOJ another opportunity to obtain and associate these records with the claims file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

With the Veteran's assistance as appropriate, obtain and associate with the Veteran's electronic claims file the entirety of the Veteran's military personnel record, particularly records from his period of active duty service in the U.S. Army from October 2004 to April 2006, including his DD-214.  All attempts to obtain these records pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(c) must be documented.
