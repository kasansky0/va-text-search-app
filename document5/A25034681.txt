ORDER

The appeal regarding the restoration of a 100 percent evaluation for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a September 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request, the Veteran disagreed with the reduction of the rating for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, from 100 percent to 0 percent, effective November 1, 2024.

2. In a subsequent October 2024 decision, the Veteran's rating for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was restored to 100 percent from November 1, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There remains no case or controversy as to the issue of whether the reduction of the evaluation for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 100 percent to 0 percent, effective November 1, 2024, was proper, and the claim is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1977 to June 1994.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 

In September 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), in which he expressed disagreement with the decision on appeal. The Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

1. The appeal regarding the restoration of a 100 percent evaluation for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.101. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).

In an April 2024 notification letter, the AOJ proposed to decrease the Veteran's evaluation for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 100 percent to 0 percent. In an August 2024 rating decision, the rating was reduced to 0 percent, effective November 1, 2024. The Veteran then submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request in April 2023, disagreeing with the reduction of the rating.

However, during the pendency of the appeal, in an October 2024 decision, the AOJ restored the Veteran's 100 percent rating from November 1, 2024, on the basis of a finding of clear and unmistakable error in the prior decision.

Thus, the Board finds that the issue of whether the reduction of the evaluation for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, from 100 percent to 0 percent, effective November 1, 2024, was proper, is moot and should be dismissed, as it has already been completely restored, and there is no justiciable case or controversy before the Board at this time with respect to this disability. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101.
