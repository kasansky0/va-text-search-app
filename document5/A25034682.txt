REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1985 to August 1988.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for veterans disagreeing with VA's decision on their claim. This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from two AMA rating decisions issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), previously referred to as the Regional Office (RO). 

In September 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested Direct Review by the Board, appealing the claims for service connection for degenerative arthritis in the lumbar spine and scoliosis, adjudicated in the November 2023 rating decision, as well as the claims for service connection for dizziness, headaches, and nausea, all secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, adjudicated in the February 2024 rating decision. 

In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence was submitted to the record to readjudicate the claims of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and scoliosis, but denied the claims on the merits. 

In the February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claims of service connection for dizziness, headaches, and nausea, all secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis. 

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review. The Veteran requested for Higher-Level Review of the claims for service connection for dizziness and headaches, both secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, as well as the claim for service connection for scoliosis, secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis. 

In an April 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision, the AOJ found that duty to assist errors were committed during the development of the claims for service connection for dizziness, headaches, and scoliosis. The AOJ overturned the following favorable findings related to the scoliosis claim: that the Veteran had a pre-existing injury, because the service entrance examination indicated that the spine was in normal condition, and that the disability had its onset in service in February 1988, because an x-ray taken in February 1988 resulted in normal findings. The AOJ also found that VA failed to conduct VA examinations and opinions addressing the dizziness and headache claims. VA examinations were conducted in June 2024.

In a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ noted that a special review was mandated on May 2, 2024. The AOJ found that new and relevant evidence was submitted to readjudicate the claim for service connection for a lumbar spine disability, as well as claims for service connection for dizziness and headaches, both secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis.

The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) in September 2024 and requested Direct Review by the Board, appealing the claims of service connection for degenerative arthritis in the lumbar spine and scoliosis adjudicated in the November 2023 rating decision as well as the claims of service connection for dizziness, headaches, and nausea, all secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis adjudicated in the February 2024 rating decision. The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal when adjudicating the claims of service connection for degenerative arthritis in the lumbar spine and scoliosis and the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal when adjudicating the claims of service connection for dizziness, headaches, and nausea, all secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that it is bound by the favorable findings made by AOJ in the April 2024 and September 2024 rating decision. Pursuant to 38 CFR § 3.104(c), "[a]ny finding favorable to the claimant made by either a VA adjudicator, as described in § 3.103(f)(4), or by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, as described in § 20.801(a) of this chapter, is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding."

Generally, the Board may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303. 

Here, in the September 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran appealed issues in the rating decisions issued in November 2023 and February 2024, which he received notifications letter for in December 2023 and February 2024, respectively. As one year has lapsed since the Veteran received notification of the rating decisions and more than 60 days has lapsed since the Notice of Disagreement, the Board is able to render the instant decision.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Legal Authority for Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

1. Entitlement to service connection for scoliosis, secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis, is denied. 

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of a current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service. Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309 (1993); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992); Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 141, 143 (1992). Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 "refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability," and held that "pain alone can serve as a functional impairment and therefore qualify as a disability").

In McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007), the Court held that the requirement of the existence of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time he files his claim for service connection or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to adjudication of the claim. However, in Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013), the Court held that when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a claimant filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency.

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has a current disability of scoliosis. There is no medical evidence in private or VA treatment records containing a diagnosis of scoliosis. The Veteran submitted to VA Thoracolumbar Spine examinations in February 2018 and April 2022, and these examinations do not contain a diagnosis of scoliosis. While the Veteran may be competent to report spine symptoms, he is not competent to diagnosis himself. Rendering a scoliosis diagnosis is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that he has the skills or medical training to make such a determination. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that criteria for entitlement to service connection for scoliosis, secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis, have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied. 

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability, secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis, is denied. 

The Veteran contends that the lumbar spine disability is related to the service-connected plantar fasciitis.

In a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that: (1) the Veteran experienced an in-service injury when he was injured during a February 1988 motor vehicle accident, (2) the Veteran has a current disability of degenerative disc disease as per the April 2022 VA examination, and (3) the primary disability (plantar fasciitis) is service-connected. See February 1988 Service Treatment Records (documenting a motor vehicle accident);  February 2018 VA Thoracolumbar Spine Examination (diagnosing degenerative arthritis of the spine); April 2022 VA Thoracolumbar Spine Examination (diagnosing degenerative disc disease); November 2024 Codesheet. In an April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ overturned the following findings: that the lumbar spine disability pre-existed service and that the current lumbar spine disability had its onset in service. 

A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111. Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b).

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active service where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306; see Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious or manifest) is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the pre-service disability underwent an increase in severity during service.

Aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. In explaining the meaning of an increase in disability, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that "temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered 'aggravation in service' unless the underlying condition, as contrasted to symptoms, is worsened." Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1992); see also Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (explaining that, for non-combat veterans, a temporary worsening of symptoms due to flare ups is not evidence of an increase in disability). However, the increase need not be so severe as to warrant compensation. Browder v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 204, 207 (1991).

If a preexisting condition was not noted at service entrance, the government must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability existed prior to service and (2) that the pre-existing disability was not aggravated during service. If the government meets this burden, the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111 is rebutted, and the claimant is not entitled to service-connected benefits. If the government fails to rebut the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C. § 1111, the claim becomes one for direct service connection. See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1097.

In this case, the lumbar spine disability is not noted on the May 1985 service entrance examination. As such, the burden is on VA to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the veteran's disability existed prior to service and (2) that the pre-existing disability was not aggravated during service. In the May 1985 Report of Medical History, the Veteran noted that he experienced recurrent back pain prior to entering service, specifically explaining that he had a history of back pain for one week. There is no notation of a lumbar spine diagnosis or persistent lumbar spine symptoms prior to entering service. Additionally, while the burden is on VA, the Veteran does not assert that the lumbar spine disability pre-existed service. Aside from this one notation of back pain prior to service entrance, which the Board considers an isolated report of acute, short-term lumbar spine pain; there is no other evidence to establish that the Veteran had a pre-existing lumbar spine disability by clear and unmistakable evidence. 

As the Veteran has been diagnosed with degenerative arthritis of the spine, which is a qualifying chronic disease pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), he is eligible for presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

Service connection may be established on a presumptive basis for chronic diseases listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a) if chronic symptoms of the disease were shown in service; the disease was manifested to a compensable degree with a presumptive period, usually one year after service separation; or continuous symptoms of the disease were manifested since service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.33 (b), 3.307, 3.309(a); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1131 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The Board finds that the symptoms of the degenerative arthritis of the spine were not chronic in service. Upon review of the service treatment records, at enlistment, the Veteran reported that he had a history of recurrent back pain prior to entering service but the military medical examiner indicated that the spine was in normal condition on the corresponding Report of Medical Examination. See May 1985 Report of Medical History; May 1985 Report of Medical Examination. The Veteran's first report of back pain in service was in June 1987. The Veteran reported general back pain, the military medical examiner did not render a formal diagnosis, there is no record of treatment instructions, and the Veteran did not seek follow up care. This general, acute report of back pain was an isolated incident. 

The next report of back pain in service was when the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident in February 1988; he reported pain caused by the injury and not chronic pain as a symptoms of arthritis. As there is only one documented instance of back pain in June 1987 that could be construed as a symptom of degenerative arthritis of the spine, and the Veteran's contention is that the lumbar spine disability is secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis and was not incurred in service, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the symptoms of the degenerative arthritis of the spine were chronic in service. 

Symptoms of the degenerative arthritis did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year after service separation. The first post-service report of arthritis symptoms was in a February 2008 Application for Compensation or Pension, filed approximately 20 years after service separation for the purpose of compensation. There is no medical or lay evidence of record indicating that degenerative arthritis symptoms manifested to a compensable degree within one year after service separation. 

The persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the symptoms of the degenerative arthritis were continuous after service separation; further, while the Veteran is certainly competent to describe arthritis symptoms during and after service, the Board finds that the Veteran is not credible in reporting as such. Post-service lumbar spine symptoms are first documented in the record, almost seven years after service separation, in January 1995 private treatment records when the Veteran sought treatment after he hurt his back moving furniture the day prior. He does not attribute any lumbar pain to service. 

The Veteran sought follow up treatment in February 1995. Then, there is a gap in evidence of continuity until the Veteran filed an Application for Compensation or Pension in February 2008 in order to request service connection for a lumbar spine disorder, 13 years later and almost 20 years after service separation. The Veteran does not specifically assert that the lumbar spine symptoms date back to service until March 2008, one month after filing his first claim for service connection. See February 2008 Application for Compensation or Pension; March 2008 Private Treatment Records. VA treatment records also contain treatment post-service injuries. In October 2016, the sought follow up treatment after he was Veteran was injured while working at Fred's warehouse. In August 2017, the Veteran sought treatment for a "recent" back injury. 

In light of the inconsistency of the Veteran's statements, on the one hand indicating that symptomatology dates back to service and the other hand reporting that symptoms are attributable to post-service injuries, the Board finds that the Veteran's recollection of arthritis symptoms inconsistent and therefore not credible.  See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 511; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1374, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that when evaluating credibility of lay statements in particular, the Board may consider whether the statements conflict with and are consistent with other statements or evidence, the potential bias of the witness, and the level of detail of the information reported); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2006) (holding the Board may reject lay statements if it finds them to be mistaken, incorrect, untrustworthy, or otherwise unreliable). 

The current lumbar spine disability was not incurred in or etiologically related to service, including the February 1988 in-service motor vehicle accident. In a February 2018 VA examination opinion, the VA examiner opined that the lumbar spine disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The VA examiner reasoned that the February 1988 in-service motor vehicle accident resulted in acute lumbar spine injuries that were treated; the Veteran had only one follow up appointment and an x-ray was taken that produced results within normal limits. The VA examiner also reasoned that there is no evidence of chronicity of care. The Veteran suffered other injuries after discharge from the service that contribute to the current lumbar spine disability. The VA examiner noted that an October 2016 post-service work injury and the Veteran's obesity contributed to his risk factors for arthritis. As this is the only direct service connection opinion within the appeal period, and there are no private opinions of record, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the current lumbar spine disability was incurred in or etiologically related to service, including the February 1988 motor vehicle accident.

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires medical evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

The Board finds that the lumbar spine disability was not caused and/or aggravated by the service-connected plantar fasciitis. In the April 2022 VA examination opinion, the VA examiner found that the lumbar spine disability is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the service-connected plantar fasciitis. The VA examiner reasoned that the lumbar spine disability is related to the October 2016 post-service work injury as imaging taken in 2019, shortly after, revealed evidence of degenerative disc disease. As this is the only secondary service connection opinion within the appeal period, and there are no private opinions of record, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against finding that the current lumbar spine disability was caused and/or aggravated by the service-connected plantar fasciitis.

The Board finds that the Veteran is not competent to provide a medical opinion as to whether the current lumbar spine disability is etiologically related to service, specifically the February 1988 in-service motor vehicle accident, or whether the current lumbar spine disability was caused and/or aggravated by the service-connected plantar fasciitis. An opinion of that nature requires medical expertise that is outside the realm of common knowledge of a layperson. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Moreover, nothing in the record demonstrates that the Veteran received any special training or acquired any medical expertise in evaluating the lumbar spine. See King v. Shinseki, 700 F. 3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Veteran is not competent to provide an etiology opinion in this case and the Board assigns minimal probative weight to the Veteran's assertions that his lumbar spine is related to service or the service-connected plantar fasciitis. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability, secondary to the service-connected plantar fasciitis, have not been met; thus, the claim must be denied.

3. Entitlement to service connection for headaches, secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, is denied.

The Veteran contends that the current headaches are related to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis. See November 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. 

In a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current disability of headaches. 

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In the instant decision, however, the Board has determined that the Veteran is not service connected for scoliosis or a lumbar spine disability, so the Veteran's secondary service connection claim for headaches, as due to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, is moot. Thus, the claim is denied. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for nausea, secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, is denied.

5. Entitlement to service connection for dizziness, secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, is denied.

The Veteran contends that the nausea and dizziness were caused by the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis. See November 2023 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim. 

The claimed nausea and dizziness are not diagnoses; they are symptoms of a diagnosis. A symptom is "subjective evidence of disease or physical disturbance" whereas a diagnosis is the "art or act of identifying a disease from its signs and symptoms." Claims for service connection require a finding of a current disability. See Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225; Symptoms (2025) Merriam Webster Dictionary. Available at: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symptoms (Accessed: April 9, 2025); Diagnosis (2025) Encyclopedia Britannica. Available at: https://www.britannica.com/science/diagnosis (Accessed: 09 April 2025). As the Veteran is seeking service connection for symptoms, not diagnosed disabilities, the Board finds that the criteria for entitlement to service connection for nausea and for dizziness, both secondary to the lidocaine patch used to treat the non-service-connected scoliosis, have not been met; thus, the two claims must be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
