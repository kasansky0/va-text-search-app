REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1972 to December 1972.

The case is on appeal from a February 2023 decision of the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC).

In the March 2023 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision of the COWC on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Regional Office (RO)/COWC in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The Board notes that a challenge to the validity of the debt has not been raised.  Thus, the scope of the appeal is limited to the waiver request.

In addition, the Board notes that the February 2023 decision of the COWC on appeal reflects a combined overpayment in the amount of $29,687.27.  

In a January 2025 letter, the COWC notified the Veteran that an October 2023 letter stating the overpayment debt had been eliminated was incorrect and had been rescinded.

Additionally, in a January 2025 decision, the COWC mitigated timeliness of the Veteran's waiver request due to his incarceration based on nonreceipt of the notification of indebtedness and denied a waiver of recovery of that portion of the debt in the amount of $15,541.98 due to incarceration; a partial waiver in the amount of $14,145.29 was granted as a result of additional dependent benefits added back to the Veteran's award.  See January 2025 Form 4-1837 (Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness).  Based on the foregoing, the issue has been recharacterized as reflected on the title page.  The Board notes that although the January 2025 decision and letter are outside the evidentiary window, they are not new evidence.  Rather, they are new legal findings.  

Waiver of recovery of an overpayment of VA compensation benefits in the adjusted amount of $15,541.98.

The overpayment in this case was created as a result of a reduction in the rate of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits following his incarceration for a felony.  The Veteran seeks a waiver of recovery of the debt.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.665, the law states, in pertinent part, that any person entitled to compensation who is incarcerated in a Federal penal institution for a period in excess of 60 days for the conviction of a felony committed after October 7, 1980, shall not be paid such compensation for the period beginning on the 61st day of such incarceration and ending on the day such incarceration ends.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5313; 38 C.F.R. § 3.665(a), (c).  In the case of a veteran with service-connected disability rated at 20 percent or more, such as this one, he shall not be paid an amount in excess of the rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(a), which is at the rate of 10 percent.  38 U.S.C. § 5313; 38 C.F.R. § 3.665.

In an August 2018 letter, the Regional Office (RO) notified the Veteran that final action had been taken to reduce payment of his compensation benefits to the 10 percent rate, effective July 7, 2012, the 61st day of his incarceration, and to remove additional benefits for a dependent spouse, effective October 1, 1999, which resulted in an overpayment.

In a September 2018 notification, the Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of the combined overpayment in the amount of $29,687.27.

As noted above, in the February 2023 decision on appeal, the COWC denied the Veteran's waiver request as untimely.  See February 2023 Form 4-1837 (Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness).  The Veteran's January 2023 waiver request referenced therein is not of record.

Thereafter, as noted above, in a January 2025 decision, the COWC granted a partial waiver in the amount of $14,145.29 as a result of additional dependent benefits added back to the Veteran's award; waiver of the portion of the overpayment in the amount of $15,541.98 due to incarceration was denied.  Although the decision states that the Veteran's January 2025 Financial Status Report showed his monthly income exceeded expenses, as noted above, under the modernized review system, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, the Board finds remand is warranted to obtain the Veteran's January 2023 waiver request noted above, as correction of that pre-decisional duty-to-assist error and/or to satisfy a regulatory or statutory duty, as correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

As noted above, although the January 2025 decision is outside the evidentiary window, it is not new evidence.  Rather, it is a new legal finding.  The Board notes that although the decision states that a DMC audit was needed, the audit, if accomplished, is not of record.  Further, and although the decision found that the Veteran was at fault in not timely notifying VA of his incarceration in May 2012, the decision does not address a July 2012 letter from the Veteran's representative stating the Veteran would be unable to attend a scheduled Board hearing because he was incarcerated.  See July 2012 Third Party Correspondence.  In addition, a June 2017 Board decision remanded the Veteran's appeal for a higher rating, including for compliance with the directives in a prior February 2014 Board remand, to include attempting to coordinate with the prison authorities at the federal penitentiary in Rochester, Minnesota, in order to obtain a VA examination.  Additionally, and although an October 2017 VA 27-0820e (Report of Incarceration) reflects the RO corroborated the Veteran's incarceration, there is no indication in either decision of the COWC that the VA Beneficiary Debt Collection Improvement Act of 2022, 136 Stat. 5462, Pub. Law 117-328 (codified at § 5302B), which is applicable to debt collection activities, including waiver requests, was considered.  In that respect, and although VA has not yet implemented regulations for this statute, it states that a debt arising from an overpayment due to delay in processing shall not arise when it is attributable to the failure of an employee or official of the Department to process information provided by or on behalf of that individual within applicable timeliness standards established by the Secretary.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain and associate with the record the Veteran's January 2023 waiver request referenced in the February 2023 decision of the COWC.

2. Then, readjudicate the request for waiver of recovery of the debt of $15,541.98, to include consideration of the VA Beneficiary Debt Collection Improvement Act of 2022, 136 Stat. 5462, Pub. Law 117-328, even if the amount has already been recouped.
