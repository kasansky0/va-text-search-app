ORDER

An effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

An effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) is denied. 

An effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code (Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA)) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The current effective date of February 11, 2019, for the 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD is the date service connection was effectuated.

2. There is no suggestion that the Veteran became unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities during the one-year period prior to February 11, 2019.

3. The basic eligibility criteria for Chapter 35 (DEA) benefits were not met prior to February 11, 2019. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a TDIU have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.16.

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits under Chapter 35 have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2009 to May 2015.  His decorations include the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  Following Higher-Level review in November 2022, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in June 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 AOJ rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claims.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  The effective date "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

An exception to that rule applies only under circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of the claim for increased compensation.  If an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of receipt of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option in response to an AMA decision on the claim, generally within one year from when the decision was issued.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, rather than as of the date the most recent request for review was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  For AOJ decisions rendered on Higher-Level Review, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a Supplemental Claim or a VA Form 10182.  In the case of continuously pursued claims, the effective date will generally be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a 70 percent evaluation for PTSD.  He has presented no argument as to why the current effective date is incorrect or why an earlier effective date is warranted.  

By way of background, on May 20, 2017, prior to the effective date of the AMA, the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim.  See May 2017 Notification Letter.  On November 18, 2017, within a year of receipt of his intent to file, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).  The application and related correspondence indicated, in pertinent part, that he was seeking service connection for depression.  The Veteran's claim was denied in a February 2018 legacy rating decision.  He was notified of that decision, and of his appellate rights, but did not initiate an appeal.

Instead, the Veteran filed a new claim for service connection for PTSD on February 11, 2019.  See February 2019 VA 21-526EZ.  Later that month, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim.  

On December 6, 2019, VA received another VA Form 21-526EZ from the Veteran requesting service connection for PTSD.  In April 2020, following additional development, the AOJ granted service connection and an initial 30 percent rating for PTSD, effective February 11, 2019.

On April 22, 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review), seeking review of the rating assigned for PTSD in the April 2020 rating decision.  In September 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision granting a 50 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD, effective February 11, 2019.

The Veteran submitted an additional VA Form 21-526EZ and a VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Individual Unemployability) in June 2021, seeking a TDIU.  In a September 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD, effective June 30, 2021.  The AOJ also awarded a TDIU based on the Veteran's PTSD, as well as basic eligibility for DEA, and assigned the same June 30, 2021, effective date for those awards.

The Veteran submitted another VA Form 20-0996 in September 2022, requesting an effective date of February 11, 2019, for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD.  In a Higher-Level Review decision dated in November 2022, the AOJ granted an effective date of February 11, 2019, for the award on the basis that the Veteran had continuously pursued his claim since that date.  The AOJ also awarded the same effective dates for the TDIU and DEA awards.  Thereafter, as noted above, the Veteran appealed those effective dates to the Board.

On review, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for a still-earlier effective date for the award of a 70 percent rating for PTSD lacks legal merit.  As noted, the 70 percent rating has been assigned from February 11, 2019, which is the effective date of the underlying award of service connection; in other words, it is an initial rating.  Because the Veteran is not service connected for PTSD prior to February 11, 2019, no rating for that disability can be assigned prior to that date as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).  The appeal of this issue must be denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of a TDIU.

The Veteran also contends that he is entitled to a TDIU prior to February 11, 2019.  He has presented no argument as to why the current effective date is incorrect or why an earlier effective date is warranted.  

A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation.  As such, the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to TDIU claims.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

Determining whether an effective date assigned for an increased rating is correct or proper under the law requires (1) a determination of the date of the receipt of the claim as well as (2) a review of all of the evidence of record to determine when an increase in disability was "ascertainable."  Hazan, 10 Vet. App. at 521.  When determining the appropriate effective date for an award of a TDIU, whether on a schedular or extraschedular basis, the effective date of such an award cannot be earlier than the effective date of the award(s) of service connection for the disability (or disabilities) upon which the TDIU award is predicated.  Delrio v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 23 (2019).

A TDIU is warranted where the evidence of record shows that a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, consistent with his education and occupational experience, as a result of service-connected disability, without regard to advancing age.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).  Provided, however, that if there is only one such disability, the disability must be rated at 60 percent or more, and that if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

The foregoing notwithstanding, it is VA's established policy that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disability shall be rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  If a Veteran fails to meet the percentage standards set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), and evidence indicates that he or she is unemployable by reason of service-connected disability, the case should be referred to the Director of the Compensation Service for extra-schedular consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).  The legal test for determining if referral is warranted is whether the evidence substantiates a reasonable possibility that the claimant is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31?Vet. App.?58, 66 (2019).

In this case, the Veteran is service connected for PTSD, evaluated as 70 percent disabling from February 11, 2019; left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of flexion, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from May 20, 2017; tinnitus, evaluated as 10 percent disabling from May 20, 2017; and left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome with limitation of extension, evaluated as 0 (zero) percent disabling from May 20, 2017.  His combined service-connected disability evaluation is 20 percent from May 20, 2017, and 80 percent from February 11, 2019.  Thus, from February 11, 2019, he had a single disability rated at least 60 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The Veteran first filed an application for a TDIU in June 2021, asserting that he had been unable to work since May 2015 due solely to his service-connected PTSD.  See June 2021 VA Form 21-8940.  In September 2021, the AOJ awarded TDIU effective from June 30, 2021, on the basis that complications of his PTSD impacted his ability to work.  

As noted above, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 in September 2022, requesting an effective date of February 11, 2019, for the award of a TDIU.  In a Higher-Level Review decision dated in November 2022, the AOJ awarded an effective date of February 11, 2019, for the TDIU award. 

On review of the record, the Board finds that a still-earlier effective date for the TDIU award cannot be assigned.  First, the effective date of the award of service connection for PTSD, upon which the TDIU award is predicated, is February 11, 2019.  As noted, a TDIU may not be awarded prior to effective date of the award of service connection for the disability upon which the award of a TDIU was based.  See Delrio, supra.  Moreover, there is no suggestion that the Veteran became unable to obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities during the one-year period prior to February 11, 2019, before service connection was established for PTSD and his other disabilities combined to only 20 percent.  To the contrary, the Veteran has specifically reported that he became too disabled to work many years earlier, in 2015.  He underwent VA knee and hearing loss examinations in February 2018.  Following examination, both examiners opined that neither the Veteran's tinnitus nor his knee disabilities would impact his ability to work.  Absent evidence substantiating a reasonable possibility that the Veteran first became unemployable due to service-connected disabilities during the one-year period prior to February 11, 2019, there is no basis for referring the matter to the Director of Compensation for extraschedular consideration during that one-year period.

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding that an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, is warranted for the award of a TDIU.  The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the appeal of this issue must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 11, 2019, for the award of basic eligibility for educational assistance benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38, United States Code (DEA).

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits for the child or surviving spouse of a veteran may be established if: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

In this case, the Veteran is still living.  Therefore, the only legal basis for establishing basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits is his having a permanent and total service-connected disability.  As set forth above, the Board has concluded that effective dates prior to February 11, 2019, are not warranted for the award of a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD or entitlement to a TDIU.  No other service-connected disability was rated as 100 percent disabling prior that date, and his overall combined rating was less than 100 percent at that time.  Accordingly, there can be no award of basic eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits prior to February 11, 2019.  The appeal of this issue must be denied.
