ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his sleep apnea began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2006 to October 2007.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran asserted that his sleep apnea was secondary to his service-connected psychiatric condition. The evidentiary record on appeal, however, contains no medical evidence linking the two disorders, and the Veteran has not been shown to possess the training or credentials to competently link the two disorders See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Moreover, as this theory was not presented at the time of the appealed rating decision, there was no duty-to-assist error in the AOJ's not obtaining a VA medical opinion as to secondary service connection. Accordingly, the appeal record does not support a grant of secondary service connection, a fact that should not prejudice the Veteran in view of the direct service connection grant below. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

The Veteran asserts that entitlement to service connection is warranted for his sleep apnea. For the reasons discussed below, entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is warranted. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

In August 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act (PACT Act) was signed into law. Therein, under?38 U.S.C. § 1168, if a Veteran submits a claim for compensation for service connection with evidence of a disability and evidence of participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during active military, naval, air, or space service, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish a service connection for the disability, VA shall provide the Veteran with a medical examination and obtain a medical opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that there is a nexus between the disability and the TERA. The PACT Act established additional presumptive diseases for in-service TERA. As applicable to Persian Gulf Veterans, the PACT Act also created a broader presumption for exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT), to include fine particulate matter. However, the PACT Act did not establish obstructive sleep apnea as a new or modified presumptive condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309;?38 U.S.C. §§ 1116(a)(2). That said, even if a disease is not listed as presumed, direct service connection must be considered. See Combee?v. Brown,?34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44?(Fed. Cir. 1994).

In the April 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current disability as he was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in a November 2023 VA examination. The AOJ also conceded participation in TERA as the Veteran was shown to serve in Southwest Asia. Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Accordingly, the question for the Board is whether obstructive?sleep apnea?was incurred in service or is otherwise attributable to an in-service injury, event, or disease, to include the recognized participation in a TERA. After a review of the claims file, the Board concludes that the evidence is persuasively in favor of finding that the condition began during active service.

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) contain findings of sleep related issues while in service. In an April 2007 treatment note, the Veteran was noted to have secondary insomnia due to stress and was treated for sleeping difficulties. The Veteran was advised sick call where he could get more appropriate evaluation and follow-up and was prescribed Ambien to help with his sleep. 

The record following service also documents the Veteran's sleep issues. In a January 2008 treatment record, the Veteran reported having sleep difficulties. In a June 2011 medical record, the Veteran reported having trouble sleeping and was noted to wake up short of breath and sweating. The Veteran reported he slept about 4-5 hours at night and endorsed insomnia. In a March 2013 medical record, the Veteran was noted to have level one sleep apnea. In an October 2016 treatment note, the Veteran reported that he did not get enough sleep. Finally, in a post-deployment health reassessment record from June 2017, the Veteran answered yes to problems sleeping or still feeling tired after sleeping. 

In a November 2023 VA opinion, the examiner opined that sleep apnea is less likely that not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner found that a review of medical records did not demonstrate existence of sleep apnea syndrome during service. The examiner noted that the Veteran had no complaints of difficulty sleeping or any reported symptoms of witnessed apneas, snoring, daytime sleepiness or gasping for air during sleep that are common symptoms of sleep apnea during service. The examiner noted that the Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in 2023, which is several years after separation from service.

In April 2024, VA obtained a medical opinion for TERA. The examiner opined that the claimed condition is less likely than caused by the indicated TERA, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA of the Veteran. The examiner found that the Veteran's sleep apnea is most likely caused by obesity and there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication of a relationship between the development of the condition at issue and the TERA. The examiner opined that there are risk factors outside of military service that far outweigh the factors identified in the TERA.

The Board affords low probative weight to the November 2023 and April 2024 VA medical opinions as they did not consider the Veteran's complaints of sleep difficulties during and since separation from service. While the Veteran underwent a sleep study in September 2023, the evidence of record, including the STRs and post-service medical records, show numerous complaints of the Veteran's sleep difficulties and insomnia during and since separation from service and well before his 2023 diagnosis of severe obstructive sleep apnea. As such, an opinion is inadequate if it does not consider all relevant evidence, including lay statements, or if it relies solely on the absence of evidence in medical literature. Dalton v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?23, 39 (2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336, n. 1 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30?Vet. App.?54, 60 (2018). 

The above discussed evidence indicating?sleep-related symptoms during and since separation from service, combined with the diagnosis of?sleep?apnea, are sufficient to establish that the Veteran's sleep apnea had its onset in service.?Furthermore, as was reasoned in Maples v. Wilkie, No. 18-2016 (Vet. App. Feb. 11, 2019), sleep apnea?is the type of disability for which lay evidence can be sufficient to support a claim for service connection for sleep apnea.?Bethea?v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?252, 254 (1992) (single judge decisions may be relied upon for any persuasiveness or reasoning they contain).? 

Here, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's?sleep?apnea?had its onset in service. Consequently, the Board resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that entitlement to service connection for?sleep?apnea is warranted.?38 U.S.C. § 5107(b);?38 C.F.R. § 3.102.???
