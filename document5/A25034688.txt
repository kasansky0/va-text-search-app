2. The criteria for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

3. The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1966 to June 1968.  The Veteran is in receipt of the Purple Heart and Combat Infantryman Badge due to his honorable service in combat in Vietnam. 

The Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy in September 2022.  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the Veteran's claims in a February 2023 rating decision.  The RO determined that since the neuropathy did not first become manifest to a compensable degree within one year after last exposure to herbicides, service connection could not be granted.  The Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review in July 2023.  In November 2023, the RO discovered a duty to assist error in not affording the Veteran an additional medical opinion.  In April 2024 (May 1, 2024 decision notice), the RO denied service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.  The RO determined that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) did not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for this condition.  The RO also determined that his condition neither occurred in nor was caused by service.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  As an appeal in which the appellant requested, on the Notice of Disagreement, a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issues on appeal, evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative at the hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing, and evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

The Veteran testified at a hearing before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in November 2024.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the electronic claims file.

The Board acknowledges the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2). Since the appellant has already had a hearing, a docket switch is precluded under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  The Board will thus proceed to adjudicate the appeal at this time.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800(c)(1).  38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2).

The Board notes that the Veteran inquired in the past about whether the VA provides a stamped copy of his DD214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.  The Board notes that copies of documents from the claims folder can be provided with a signed request.  Documents are not normally stamped, but the Veteran may submit this request for further review if he still requires a copy of his DD214.

Factual history

In October 1967, the Veteran was hit with a rocket in Vietnam and subsequently had wounds of all four extremities.  November 1967 STRs indicated right meralgia paresthetica (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment).  The Veteran's separation exam indicated that he could not stand for prolonged periods.  The Veteran testified that he was hospitalized for eight months post-service for treatment for injuries sustained in combat in service.  See November 2024 Hearing Transcript.  He stated he was not able to walk during this period.  Id.  VA treatment records indicated ongoing peripheral neuropathy problems.  The Veteran stated he first noticed the symptoms in 2017.  See November 2014 Hearing transcript.  The Veteran described the symptoms as numbness, tingling, sort of like pins and needles.  Id.  Then it started to feel like a burning sensation on the top of his left and right foot.  Id.  Then that pain increased.  Id.  The numbness increased.  Id.  Then he started to have balance problems.  Id.  The Veteran testified that because of his lower extremity peripheral neuropathy he had fallen several times.  Id.

December 2022 VA treatment records indicated that the Veteran's Activities of Daily Living (ADL) needs included lower body bathing (legs, feet and back) and dressing lower body (including shoes and socks). A caregiver prepared the Veteran's food.  The Veteran did not attempt to walk more than 12 feet with a cane and caregiver supervision due to fear of falling and pain in foot and ankle from neuropathy.  A social worker stated in December 2022 that the Veteran's prognosis was not going to improve.  

In February 2023, the RO afforded the Veteran a Peripheral Nerves Conditions (not Including Diabetic Sensory Motor Peripheral Neuropathy) Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination.  A February 2023 examiner diagnosed bilateral peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities.  The Veteran stated that he experienced multiple episodes of bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling.  The Veteran reported periodic pain which had migrated up both legs.  He was placed on Duloxetine for his peripheral neuropathy.  The Veteran reported chronicity and stability of symptoms with periodic episodes of flare ups all managed conservatively, i.e. rest, ice, and periodic use of oral ibuprofen, Duloxetine.  The functional impact was that the Veteran had limited functionally with continuous/frequent activities requiring running, hiking, jumping, squatting, bending, stooping, or heavy lifting/carrying or objects.  The February 2023 examiner stated that the Veteran had early onset peripheral neuropathy affecting both lower extremities i.e. burning tingling sensation along the plantar surface of both feet tracking proximally up both lower extremities.  The February 2023 examiner stated that there was no known etiology for this condition.

The Veteran submitted journal articles on the Chemistry and lung toxicity of particulate matter emitted from firearms, as well as a journal article on the Association of MOS-Based Blast Exposure with Medical Outcomes

In December 2023, the RO requested a medical opinion.  A clinician opined that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was less likely than not (likelihood was less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the toxic exposure in Vietnam or military occupational specialty (MOS) of field artillery and mortar gunner, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.  The December 2023 clinician explained that peripheral neuropathy referred to damage or dysfunction of the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.  The December 2023 clinician explained that this condition could result in symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain in the affected areas.  The December 2023 clinician explained that while some Veterans may experience peripheral neuropathy, it was important to note that this condition could have various causes, and that it may not necessarily be related to toxic exposure in Vietnam or military occupational specialty duties of field artillery and mortar gunner.  The December 2023 clinician reasoned that in the Veteran's case, his peripheral neuropathy was believed to be more likely associated with his chronic lower back condition rather than exposure to toxins in Vietnam.  The December 2023 clinician explained that chronic lower back conditions, such as degenerative disc disease, herniated discs, or spinal stenosis, can lead to compression or irritation of nerves in the lower back. This nerve compression can contribute to symptoms like those seen in peripheral neuropathy.

The Veteran testified that his treatment for his peripheral neuropathy included external medication of creams and acupuncture, as well as testing the nerves with electronic devices.  See November 2024 Hearing transcript.

Law

VA grants service connection for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997) (holding that interpretation of sections 1110 and 1131 of the statute as requiring the existence of a present disability for VA compensation purposes cannot be considered arbitrary). Evidence must at least show the appellant has the disability for which benefits are being claimed, else, there necessarily can be no valid claim because, for all intents and purposes, there is no present disability to in turn relate or attribute to his military service.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  A current disability means a disability shown by competent and credible (i.e., probative) evidence to exist.  Chelte v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 268 (1997).  Pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability if it reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In addition, certain chronic diseases, such as organic disease of the nervous system including peripheral neuropathy, may be presumed to have been incurred in, or aggravated by, service if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from qualifying military service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Additionally, service connection on the basis of continuity of symptomatology can be established for the chronic diseases specified at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed resulting from service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Also, under certain circumstances, service connection for specific diseases, including peripheral neuropathy, may be presumed if a Veteran was exposed during service to certain herbicide agents.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(e).  If a Veteran was exposed to herbicides agents during service, service connection for peripheral neuropathy will be presumed if the disease became manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more disabling within a year after the last date on which the Veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6)(ii), 3.309(e).

Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, are presumed to have been exposed to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence of non-exposure.  38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to exhaust all schedular alternatives for rating a disability that are expressly raised or are reasonably raised by the record. Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162 (2019).  The Board is required to develop and adjudicate related claims for secondary service connection for disabilities that are reasonably raised during the adjudication of a formally initiated claim for the proper evaluation level for the primary service-connected disability.  Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 203-04 (2021).

Special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (l) is payable if the Veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or is permanently bedridden, or so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance of another person.

In determining the need for regular aid and attendance of another person, the following will be accorded consideration: being so helpless (due to service-connected disabilities) as to be permanently bedridden or in need of regular aid and attendance.  Aid and attendance is defined as: inability to dress or undress, or to keep ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability  cannot be done without aid; inability to feed oneself through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or physical or mental incapacity which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to the daily environment.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (a).  "Bedridden" means that condition which requires that the claimant remain in bed.  Voluntarily taking to bed or the fact that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice.  Id. 

It is only necessary that the evidence shows that the claimant is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need.  Turco v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 222, 224 (1996).  Determination as to the need for regular aid and attendance will not be based solely upon an opinion that their condition is such as would require them to be in bed.  They must be based on the actual requirement of personal assistance from others.  The performance of the necessary aid and attendance service by a relative of the beneficiary or other member of his or her household will not prevent the granting of the additional allowance.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.352 (c).

"When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant." 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  "Evidence is not in 'approximate balance' or 'nearly equal,' and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other."  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

1. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy

The Veteran asserts that he has right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy that is due to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam. See September 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Board finds that the Veteran has experienced leg numbness related to right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy since service.  As such, the criteria for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are met.

First, the Board notes that the RO found the Veteran has a current disability.  See April 2024 Rating Decision.  He was diagnosed with right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy during the February 2023 VA examination.  In addition, the RO found that the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during military service.  See April 2024 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

As stated above, certain chronic diseases will be presumed resulting from service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Therefore, the next question for the Board is when the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was noted.  The Board finds that the symptom of numbness was first noted contemporaneous with release from active duty and continued to be experienced since service.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran testified that he first noticed the symptoms in 2017.  The Board affords the VA treatment records more weight in this regard because they show an earlier onset.

There is a negative December 2023 opinion.  The Board affords it some probative weight. However, the December 2023 opinion did not address the continuity of symptoms in the Veteran's right lower extremity since service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against continuity of symptomatology of the Veteran's right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is at least in approximate balance.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds that the Veteran experience continuous symptoms of right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy since service.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The criteria for service connection for right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are met.

The Board notes that its grant of service connection is based on the evidence of peripheral neuropathy symptoms in service that has continued through the present.  As service connection has been granted on this basis, the Board will not address other theories of entitlement such as presumptive service connection due to Agent Orange exposure.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy

The Veteran also asserts that he has left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy that is due to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam. See September 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Board finds that the Veteran has experienced leg weakness related to left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy since service.  As such, the criteria for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are met.

First, the Board notes that the RO found the Veteran has a current disability.  See April 2024 Rating Decision.  He was diagnosed with left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy during the February 2023 VA examination.  In addition, the RO found that the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during military service.  See April 2024 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

As stated above, certain chronic diseases will be presumed resulting from service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Therefore, the next question for the Board is when the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy was noted.  As noted above, the Veteran was hit by a rocket, he experienced wounds to his left lower extremity, and had difficulty standing and walking.  Even after healing, he could not stand for prolonged periods.  See Separation exam.  The Board finds that these were symptoms of left lower extremity weakness, which was first noted during active duty and continued to be experienced since service.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran testified that he first noticed the symptoms in 2017.  The Board affords the VA treatment records more weight in this regard because they show an earlier onset.

There is a negative December 2023 opinion.  The Board affords it some probative weight. However, the December 2023 opinion did not address the continuity of symptoms in the Veteran's left lower extremity since service.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence for and against continuity of symptomatology of the Veteran's left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy is at least in approximate balance.  The Board affords the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and finds that the Veteran experience continuous symptoms of left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy since service.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F. 3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  The criteria for service connection for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy are met.

The Board notes that its grant of service connection is based on the Veteran's statements that he noticed symptoms in his feet shortly after his separation from service that has continued through the present.  As service connection has been granted on this basis, the Board will not address other theories of entitlement such as presumptive service connection due to Agent Orange exposure.

The Board finds that the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral upper extremity peripheral neuropathy are not reasonably raised by the record.  VA treatment records discussed possible monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and peripheral neuropathy due to unknown etiology or possibly the spine.  However, these records are not sufficient to raise the issue of entitlement to service connection for upper extremity peripheral neuropathy as within the scope of his lower extremity peripheral neuropathy claims.  The Veteran may submit a claim for service connection for these issues if he would like to seek service connection for them. 

3. Entitlement to special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance 

The issue of special monthly compensation based on the need for aid and attendance is reasonably raised by the record.  In considering the evidence of record under the laws and regulations as set forth above, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance.

The Veteran is currently service connected with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with recurrent moderate major depressive disorder (rated at 100 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); right hip/thigh status post shrapnel wound with retained shrapnel and chronic capsulitis involving muscle groups XIII, XIV, XVII, XVIII (rated at 30 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); status post shrapnel wound, of right upper extremity, muscle group VI, VIII (rated at 30 percent disabling from November 1, 2014); status post shrapnel wound of left thigh, muscle group XV (rated at 20 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); status post shrapnel wounds right hand with failed tendon repair, retained shrapnel, and fifth finger ankylosis (rated at 10 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); tinnitus (rated at 10 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); residual scars, status post shrapnel wound to face (rated at 10 percent disabling from June 21, 2013); hemorrhoids (rated at 0 percent disabling from June 11, 1968); recurrent diarrhea (rated at 0 percent disabling from June 11, 1968); scars, residuals of shrapnel wounds both thighs, abdomen and chest, both arms with retained foreign bodies (rated at 0 percent disabling from June 11, 1968); and bilateral hearing loss (rated at 0 percent disabling from June 21, 2013).  The total overall rating is 100 percent disabling from June 21, 2013.  The Board has now granted service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy.  He also is in receipt of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114, subsection (s) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i) on account of chronic PTSD with recurrent moderate major depressive disorder rated 100 percent disabling and additional service-connected disabilities which combine to be independently ratable at 60 percent or more.

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance purposes for his issues associated with his service-connected disabilities.  The Board finds highly probative the December 2022 VA treatment records, which indicated that the Veteran's ADL needs included lower body bathing (legs, feet and back) and dressing lower body (including shoes and socks). A caregiver prepared the Veteran's food.  The Veteran did not attempt to walk more than 12 feet with a cane and caregiver supervision due to fear of falling and pain in foot and ankle from neuropathy.  A social worker stated in December 2022 that the Veteran's prognosis was not going to improve.  In November 2024, the Veteran testified that because of his lower extremity peripheral neuropathy he had fallen several times.

Based on the foregoing, the evidence persuasively shows that the Veteran was so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, as he had service-connected disabilities that required care or assistance on a regular basis.  Accordingly, the Board concludes that entitlement to SMC based on the need for aid and attendance is warranted.
