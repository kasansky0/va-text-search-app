FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  Prior to March 21, 2024, the Veteran's left knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis was not productive of flexion limited to 30 degrees or less or the functional equivalent thereof.

2.  Prior to March 21, 2024, the Veteran's right knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis was not productive of flexion limited to 30 degrees or less or the functional equivalent thereof.

3.  Prior to March 21, 2024, the Veteran's left knee disability was not productive of patellar instability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 21, 2024 for an increased evaluation from 10 to 20 percent for left knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260 (2024).

3.  The criteria for an effective date earlier than March 21, 2024 for an award of a separate 10 percent evaluation for left knee patellar instability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1978 to January 1985.

This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of his ratings for his knee disabilities most recently addressed in a March 2024 Board decision.  In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted increased ratings for left and right knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis, effective March 21, 2024, and granted a separation 10 percent rating for left knee patellar instability, based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  In June 2024, the Veteran requested HLR of the assigned effective dates and ratings.  In July 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which denied earlier effective dates and higher ratings, considering the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2024 decision.  

In his August 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket and identified the issues on appeal as "earlier effective date for knees."  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the May 2024 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the period of eligibility to amend the Veteran's August 2024 notice of disagreement to elect a different docket has not yet lapsed.  See 38?C.F.R. §?20.202(c)(2).  The Veteran, however, submitted a September 2024 letter indicating financial hardship.  This letter was construed as a motion to advance on the docket.  While the Board denied this motion in October 2024, the Board nevertheless finds that the September 2024 submission establishes an intent to have his appeal decided as expeditiously as possible, constituting waiver of his right to elect another docket.  The Board may therefore adjudicate his appeal without further delay.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 21, 2024 for an increased evaluation from 10 to 20 percent for left knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 21, 2024 for an increased evaluation from 10 to 20 percent for right knee chondromalacia with osteoarthritis

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 21, 2024 for an award of a separate 10 percent evaluation for left knee patellar instability

The Veteran claims earlier effective dates for his increased ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities.  

Generally, the effective date of an award of an increased rating is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the earliest date that the claimed increase in disability had occurred was factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record within one year prior to the receipt of claim, the effective date is the date such increase occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

A claim date may be maintained by?continuously pursuing?a claim or issue via supplemental claim, request for HLR, appeal to the Board, or appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), provided such options are timely exercised within one year of the issuance of the decision.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  For supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, the effective date will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim.? 38 C.F.R. §?3.2500(h)(2). 

The Veteran submitted a legacy claim for increased ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities in January 2017.  The claim was denied by a May 2017 rating decision.  Before this decision became final, the Veteran submitted a June 2017 claim and underwent a July 2017 VA examination, constituting new and material evidence that abrogated the finality of the May 2017 rating decision.  Increased ratings were again denied by an August 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran submitted a timely appeal in December 2017.  The Board remanded the issues in July 2019 and May 2023 before ultimately denying increased ratings in a March 2024 decision.  The Veteran submitted then submitted the March 2024 supplemental claim giving rise to this appeal, continuously pursuing the claim.  The Board therefore finds that the relevant claim date is in January 2017, and the question before the Board is whether the evidence establishes that entitlement to increased ratings arose prior to March 21, 2024.

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  Consideration must also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria.").  Moreover, joint testing is to be conducted on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 170 (2016).  VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the claimants themselves when a flare-up or repeated use over time is not observable at the time of examination.  Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 permit consideration of ankylosis ratings if a claimant's functional loss is the functional equivalent of ankylosis.  See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020).  If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the claimant will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(g).  If the revised version of the regulation is more favorable, the implementation of that regulation under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) can be no earlier than the effective date of that change.  If the former version is more favorable, VA can apply the earlier version of the regulation for the period prior to, and from, the effective date of the change.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  Therefore, the Board will consider the Veteran's claim under the old criteria prior to February 7, 2021 and both the old and new rating criteria from February 7, 2021.  The criteria that is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings apply under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  The Veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability evaluations.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1995).

The Veteran was in receipt of two 10 percent ratings, increased to 20 percent effective March 21, 2024, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.  Under this code, flexion of the leg is rated noncompensable when limited to 60 degrees, 10 percent when limited to 45 degrees, 20 percent when limited to 30 degrees, and 30 percent when limited to 15 degrees.  

The Veteran was also granted a separate 10 percent rating for left knee patellar instability effective March 21, 2024 under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.  Under this code, prior to the February 2021 amendments, recurrent subluxation or lateral instability was rated at 10 percent for slight instability, 20 percent for moderate instability, and 30 percent for severe instability.  When addressing knee instability under DC 5257 for the rating criteria prior to February 7, 2021, objective medical evidence is not required to establish lateral knee instability. English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347, 352 (2018).

As of February 7, 2021, under the amended criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition with recurrent instability that does not require a prescription for a brace, cane, or walker; or for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear causing persistent instability without a prescription for an assistive device or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription for a brace, cane, or walker; or for a sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear causing persistent instability with a prescription for an assistive device or bracing for ambulation.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription for a brace and either a cane or a walker; or for an unrepaired or failed repair of a complete ligament tear causing persistent instability with a prescription for both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation.  

The Board acknowledges that the terms "slight," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  As the Board's decision to deny an earlier effective date is based on a finding of no instability prior to March 21, 2024, definitions of these terms are not required.

VA treatment records reflect that in November 2016 the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain.  He reported that he walked two miles per day and that his left knee swelled up at times and was painful.  X-rays showed degenerative arthritis.

Private treatment records reflect that in January 2017 the Veteran presented to the emergency room after falling on the ice, injuring his left knee.  X-rays showed no fracture but chronic degenerative changes.  He was diagnosed with a left knee contusion.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2017.  He described severe flare-ups rated at 10/10 from a baseline of 7/10.  Flare-ups were triggered by walking distances greater than 500 feet.  He reported regular use of a cane.  He stated he was unable to squat.  Bilateral flexion was limited to 130 degrees, and bilateral extension was full to 0 degrees.  Pain was noted in flexion.  There was no evidence of pain with weight bearing, pain on palpation, or crepitus.  Repetitive testing did not lead to additional loss of range of motion or function.  The examination was neither medically consistent nor inconsistent with his statements describing functional loss with flare-ups or repeated use over time.  Muscle strength was full without atrophy.  There was no ankylosis.  there was no history of recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, or recurrent effusion.  Stability tests were normal.  There was no evidence or history of tibial or fibular impairments or of meniscal conditions.  He was diagnosed with chondromalacia of the bilateral knees.

Private treatment records reflect that in April 2017 the Veteran presented to the emergency room reporting right knee pain.  He exhibited normal range of motion, no swelling, no effusion, no laxity, normal alignment, normal meniscus, and normal patellar mobility.  X-rays showed moderate degenerative findings and a moderate joint effusion with a possible ligamentous tear.

VA treatment records reflect that in April 2017 the Veteran stated that he had presented to a private emergency room the prior weekend for unrelenting right knee pain.  X-rays were consistent with prior imaging.  He described intermittent flares where pain acutely worsens after stepping wrong, lasting for a few days at a time.  He stated he fell three times over the prior year due to buckling knees.  He denied locking or catching.  He reported intermittent stiffness.  Flexion was full to 140 degrees bilaterally with pain at 100 degrees in the right knee and 110 degrees in the left knee.  Extension was full to 0 degrees bilaterally.  Muscle strength was full.  Instability tests were negative.  He was diagnosed with bilateral knee osteoarthritis.  In June 2017 his knees exhibited intact ranges of motion.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in July 2017.  He reported pain and difficulty walking, treated with ibuprofen.  Flare-ups were described as aggravated pain from using stairs, kneeling, squatting, or prolonged sitting.  Flexion was limited to 100 degrees in the right knee and 90 degrees in the left knee.  Extension was full to 0 degrees bilaterally.  Pain was noted in all ranges.  There was no evidence of pain with weight bearing, pain on palpation, or crepitus.  He was unable to perform repetitive testing due to pain.  The examiner was unable to describe functional loss with flare-ups or repeated use over time without observing the Veteran under such conditions.  Muscle strength was 4/5 without atrophy.  There was no ankylosis.  there was no history of recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, ore recurrent effusion.  Stability tests were not performed due to pain.  There was no evidence or history of tibial or fibular impairments or of meniscal conditions.  He was diagnosed with chondromalacia of the bilateral knees. 

In his November 2017 legacy notice of disagreement, the Veteran reported that his equilibrium and balance were off in both knees.  He described constant pain and felt that his swelling was not considered by the rating decision.  He also stated that there were no recent x-rays.

VA treatment records reflect that in November 2017 the Veteran reported worsening right knee pain.  In April 2018 he reported bilateral knee pain, worse with walking.  Muscle strength was full.  He exhibited crepitus with active and passive motion.  He was diagnosed with bilateral knee arthritis.  In November 2019 he reported ongoing bilateral knee pain.

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in July 2020.  He reported worsening pain and difficulty walking, treated by ibuprofen and Tylenol.  He described flare-ups consisting of worsening pain.  He reported difficulty walking more than a quarter mile.  He reported constant use of a cane.  Flexion was limited to 110 degrees bilaterally, and extension was full to 0 degrees bilaterally.  Pain was noted in all ranges and with weight bearing.  There was objective evidence of pain on palpation rated at 5/10.  There was evidence of crepitus.  Repetitive testing led to additional losses of function through pain but not loss of range of motion.  The examiner determined that repeated use over time limited function due to pain but not to the point equivalent to a reduction of range.  The examiner determined that pain due to flare-ups resulted in the functional equivalent of flexion limited to 50 degrees bilaterally.  Muscle strength was 4/5 without atrophy.  There was no history of recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, or recurrent effusion.  Stability tests were normal.  There was no evidence or history of ankylosis, tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscal conditions.  He was diagnosed with bilateral knee chondromalacia.

VA treatment records reflect that in September 2020 the Veteran presented to the emergency room reporting left hip, left knee, and low back pain for two weeks.  He was diagnosed with joint pain.  In December 2021 he presented to the emergency room reporting chronic bilateral knee pain, which, for the prior few days, was more painful and caused difficulty getting up or down.  He was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knees and given medication.

Private treatment records include December 2022 x-rays showing moderate tricompartmental degenerative change.

VA treatment records reflect that in January 2023 the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain and was requesting a walk-in shower.  His physician noted adequate ranges of motion for all extremities.  At a June 2023 physical therapy consultation, he reported that his balance was bad and that he could not stand still for over 30 seconds.  He stated that he could not walk more than 20 feet, though prior to the last few months he was walking as much as he wanted.  He initially stopped walking because of a heel spur, but it went away.  

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in June 2023.  He stated that he could not walk and did not know why.  Flare-ups were described as morning pain and pain with weight bearing.  He reported regular use of a wheelchair.  He reported that his left knee felt tight at times.  Flexion was limited to 80 degrees bilaterally.  Extension was full to 0 degrees bilaterally.  Pain was noted in all ranges.  There was evidence of pain with active motion, weight bearing, and on palpation.  There was no crepitus.  Repetitive testing did not lead to additional loss of function or range.  The examiner determined that repeated use over time limited function due to pain but not to the point equivalent to a reduction of range.  The examiner determined that pain due to flare-ups resulted in the functional equivalent of flexion limited to 40 degrees bilaterally.  There was no muscle atrophy.  There was no evidence or history of ankylosis, recurrent subluxation, lateral instability, tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscal conditions.  He was diagnosed with chondromalacia of the bilateral knees.  

VA treatment records reflect that in August 2023 the Veteran reported bilateral knee pain for the prior three years.  Ranges of motion were normal on gross examination.  At an orthopedic consultation he reported pain increased by weightbearing activities, kneeling, squatting, and using stairs.  He was diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the bilateral knees.  His orthopedic surgeon noted that he was not a candidate for surgery due to his weight.  In October 2023 he reported continued knee pain.  In November 2023 he reported that his knee pain increased with all weightbearing activity.  His orthopedist noted that he was not a candidate for injections or surgery due to his uncontrolled diabetes with morbid obesity.  He was referred for physical therapy.

In his supplemental claim, received by VA on March 21, 2024, the Veteran's representative argued that the orthopedic surgeon's finding that he was not a candidate for surgery constituted a finding of a medical need for total knee replacements. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2024.  He reported a constant dull ache rated at 4/10 with flareups precipitated by prolonged walking, prolonged standing, attempts to kneel, attempts to squat, using stairs, or walking on uneven terrain.  During flare-ups the Veteran reported experiencing an 80 percent decrease in ranges of motion.  He reported a tendency for his left knee to buckle front to back.  He reported occasional use of a brace, a cane, and a motorized scooter.  Flexion was limited to 100 degrees in the right knee and 110 degrees in the left knee.  Extension was full to 0 degrees bilaterally.  Pain was noted in weight bearing, non-weight bearing, at rest, and in active and passive motion.  There was evidence of crepitus and tenderness to palpation.  Repetitive testing did not lead to additional loss of function or range.  The examiner determined that pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance with flare-ups and repeated use over time further limited flexion to 20 degrees in the right knee and 25 degrees in the left knee.  There was no muscle atrophy.  There was instability in the left knee.  There was no evidence or history of ankylosis, tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscal conditions.  He was diagnosed with chondromalacia of the bilateral knees with osteoarthritis.

In a statement accompanying his June 2024 request for HLR, the Veteran's representative argued that the supplemental claim raised the unanswered contention that because he was ineligible for surgery, he was entitled to the postsurgical rating of 30 percent.  The representative further argued that such a rating should go back to February 9, 2024.  The representative stated that this was the date when VA obtained documented evidence that total knee replacements could not be completed.  The source of this date is unclear.

In argument accompanying his August 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran's representative quoted the argument accompanying the HLR request in its entirety, reiterating the request for an effective date of February 9, 2024.  

The Board notes that in the Veteran's August 2024 notice of disagreement, both the VA Form 10182 and the accompanying argument identify earlier effective dates as the issues being appealed, not increased ratings.  As such, the Board will limit its review to whether entitlement to the 20 ratings based on limitation of flexion and a 10 percent rating based on instability arose prior to March 21, 2024.  The Board will not address whether higher ratings are warranted.

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's entitlement to increased ratings arose prior to March 21, 2024.  

The Veteran's increased ratings under Diagnostic Code 5260 are based on findings of the functional equivalent of flexion limited to 30 degrees or less, specifically the 20 and 25 degrees or less noted at the April 2024 VA examination.  There is no evidence of such findings prior to March 21, 2024.  The June 2023 VA examination report fully complied with Sharp with a finding that flexion would be limited to 40 degrees in flare-ups and with repeated use over time.  There is no evidence to contradict this finding prior to March 21, 2024.  Moreover, because these findings are based on procured evidence, including the Veteran's description of his knee pain at its worst, such descriptions can be expected to describe the pain that prompts the Veteran to use his reported medication, not a level of impairment that reflects the beneficial effects of such medication.  See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798 (Mar. 12, 2025).  

The Veteran's separate rating under Diagnostic Code 5257 is based on a finding of left knee instability.  There is no evidence of such findings prior to March 21, 2024.  While the Veteran reported a history of falls that he attributed to buckling in April 2017, VA examiners in March 2017, April 2017, July 2020, and June 2023 all found no instability.  There is no competent evidence to contradict these findings, which are consistent with his treatment records, which document a single fall during the appeal period in January 2017, which was due to slipping on ice.  It is not until his April 2024 VA examination that the Veteran was diagnosed with knee instability.

The Board recognizes that the Veteran's representative argues for an effective date based on his orthopedic surgeon's finding that he was not a candidate for surgery or for treatment via injections.  His rating, however, was not increased based on this dubious argument.  There is nothing in the rating criteria for knee replacements analogous to the rating criteria for plantar fasciitis, which instruct to rate claimants on the residuals of surgical treatment they are not candidates for.  Compare 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Diagnostic Code 5055 with 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5269.  The question before the Board is not whether the Veteran is entitled to ratings based on surgery he did not have, but whether his instability, and flexion limited to 30 degrees or less - the basis of his ratings - manifested prior to March 21, 2024.

For these reasons, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's entitlement to increased ratings arose prior to March 21, 2024.  Earlier effective dates are therefore denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
