ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left hand rash is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran has a current left hand rash condition.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left hand rash have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army on active duty from September 1999 to September 2002 and June 2003 to May 2004, with additional National Guard and Reserve service. 

The issue comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the July 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran also included his claims for service connection for back strain and bone fracture(s) on the July 2024 VA Form 10182. However, the appeals for those claims were untimely as the rating decision issued on those claims was dated in April 2019, and the Veteran did not file a VA Form 10182 within one year of notification of that rating decision. Therefore, those issues are not before the Board at this time.

Entitlement to service connection for left hand rash

The Veteran contends that he has a current disability of a left hand rash. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). 

Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board notes that the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability benefits. See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Therefore, in the absence of current disability, there can be no valid claim. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). 

However, the Board notes that a lack of a formal diagnosis is not dispositive. The term "disability" as used in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to the functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying cause of said disability." See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The Board finds that the record is absent any evidence of a current disability, or even symptoms of a current left hand rash condition. It does not appear that there are any private or VA treatment records to reflect any left hand rash condition. Additionally, there are no lay statements to support any indicia of the existence of a current left hand rash condition. 

The Board also finds the available medical evidence of record does not show any left hand rash condition that has impaired the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks, and the Veteran has not proffered any lay statements as to functional impairment caused. Thus, the Veteran's claimed left hand rash condition has not demonstrated functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1368.

Accordingly, the evidence of record does not show the Veteran has a current left hand rash condition for the purposes of VA compensation benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 1110. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). Thus, the Veteran's claim for service connection is denied. 

The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against a grant of service connection for the Veteran's left hand rash, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
