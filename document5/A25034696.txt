ORDER

Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for migraines is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) based on a single service-connected disability (migraines) is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the statutory housebound rate prior to October 28, 2020 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's manifestations of migraine headaches are contemplated by the maximum schedular evaluation assigned for the disability throughout the entire period on appeal; her migraines are manifested by very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability during the entire appeal period.

2. During the entire appeal period, the record reflects the Veteran was unable to obtain or retain substantially gainful employment due solely on her service-connected migraines.

3. Based on the Board's finding for TDIU based solely on migraines, the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent plus additional service-connected disabilities rated at least 60 percent that are separate and distinct prior to October 28, 2020.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for migraines are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124, Diagnostic Code 8100.

2. The criteria for entitlement to TDIU based on a single disability (migraines) are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16.

3. The criteria for SMC at the statutory housebound rate prior to October 28, 2020 are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2011 to September 2014.  She appeals an August 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denying entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 50 percent for migraines and denying entitlement to SMC at the statutory housebound rate prior to October 28, 2020.  See August 2024 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran requested the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  Id.

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 2023 rating decision.  In August 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 2023 rating decision.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7113 (a).  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Increased Rating for Migraines

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes (DCs) identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R., Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

When considering the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, the Board will consider the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999).

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to more than a 50 percent initial disability rating for her service-connected migraines.  See August 2024 representative argument.

Headaches are evaluated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100, which provides for a 10 percent disability rating for characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months.  Finally, a maximum 50 percent disability rating is assigned for very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

The Veteran reported her migraines occur "at least three to four times per week," lasting anywhere from less than one day to two days per attack and include a "sharp pressure like pain" that begins behind the eyes and radiates throughout her head.  See October 2019, April 2021, and March 2023 VA examination reports.  The Veteran noted changes her in vision with light and sound sensitivity during attacks that require she lie down and close her eyes.  Id.  The Veteran noted she receives Botox injections every three months, which reduce the severity of her migraines, but not the frequency.  Id.; see also February 2023 VA Form 21-4138.  Without the Botox treatment, the Veteran states her migraines are "extremely severe events."  Id.  At a March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran noted she still had more than one prostrating migraine each month and the examiner noted her migraines still produced severe economic inadaptability despite current treatment.  The Board notes the Veteran's headaches have also been variously treated during the appeal period with Butalbital, Naproxen, and an antidepressant that caused anxiety attacks.  Id.  The Veteran noted one prior medication made her confused.  Id.

Examiners found the Veteran would have a difficult time concentrating and focusing on tasks during attacks.  Id.  It was also noted she had at least one characteristic prostrating attack every month.  Id.  The Veteran stated she will still have "a bad episode" "every so often" where she must lay down in a dark room for "several hours."  See February 2023 VA Form 21-4138.

The Veteran's service-connected headaches have been assigned the maximum schedular rating available for the entire rating period.  The Veteran's representative argues her migraines alone render her unable to obtain and maintain substantial employment, and this argument is further discussed in the Remand section, below.  Overall, however, the evidence does not reflect, and the Veteran does not contend of additional symptoms not contemplated in the rating criteria for a 50 percent disability rating.  See August 2024 Representative letter.  Thus, the Board finds there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular evaluation for her service-connected headaches, which result in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8100; see also Morgan v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 162, 167 (2019).

TDIU Based on Migraines

As noted above, the Veteran contends her migraines alone render her unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment during the appeal period.  See August 2024 Representative letter.

The Veteran is already in receipt of TDIU, or a total 100 percent rating, during the entire appeal period.  Prior to October 28, 2020, the AOJ found the Veteran's combined service connected disabilities, in concert, rendered her unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment, but thereafter, the AOJ found her depressive disorder alone prevented employment.  See June 2021 and August 2023 rating decisions.

Although the Veteran is in receipt of TDIU during the entire appeal period, a 100 percent disability rating does not always render the issue of TDIU moot as VA has a duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011).  Here, the argument for TDIU based on an individual disability raises the possibility of entitlement to additional benefits, such as entitlement to SMC.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  For example, the Veteran received entitlement to SMC at the statutory housebound rate from October 28, 2020 because she was awarded TDIU based solely on her service-connected depressive disorder (considered a 100 percent rating) and she had other service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected depressive disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  Here, the Veteran requests SMC at the statutory housebound rate prior to October 28, 2020.

Total disability will be considered to exist where there presently is any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.340.  Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, or 100 percent, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements.  Here, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for TDIU as she has already been found entitled to TDIU for the entire appeal period.

As such, the narrow issue before the Board is whether the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to her service-connected migraines.

In determining whether a veteran can secure, follow, and maintain a substantially gainful occupation, the Board must consider: (1) the Veteran's occupational history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.  See Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  To determine whether TDIU is warranted, the Board must conduct a holistic and individualized assessment of the veteran.  See Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139, 142 (2018).

The record reflects the Veteran graduated high school and completed one year of college prior to enlisting in the Air Force.  See December 2019 VA examination report.  While in the Air Force, her military occupational specialty was air traffic control.  Id.  After her separation in September 2014, the Veteran stated she began studying nursing.  Id.  At a June 2021 psychiatric VA examination, the Veteran stated she was still in school studying nursing.  Id.  The record reflects the Veteran obtained a bachelor's degree in nursing in the Spring of 2022.  See July 2022 VA treatment records.  The AOJ previously established that the Veteran had not been substantially employed during the appeal period.  See September 2021 rating decision.  In fact, the record reflects the Veteran has "not been able to gain employment" since her discharge from the Air Force in September 2014.  See May 2021 VA Form 21-8940.  Overall, the Board finds the Veteran has little employment background and could work in an unskilled labor or customer service position.  She also has the education to obtain employment in the nursing field.

The Veteran's migraine symptoms are discussed in detail above.  The Veteran is competent and credible to report what she feels, such as the frequency and severity of headache-related pain; accordingly, the Board finds her statements credible.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Overall, the record reflects she has very long, frequent, and completely prostrating migraines.  The AOJ found the Veteran's migraines resulted in very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  See May 2023 rating decision.

The record also reflects her migraines are very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability even with consistent medication.  Without considering the ameliorative effects of medication, the Board finds the Veteran's migraines would cause severe economic inadaptability and entitle the Veteran to TDIU.  See Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (2025).

The Veteran receives Botox injections every three months for "intractable migraines" and a VA neurologist prescribed magnesium and Motrin, as needed, to lessen the frequency and severity of her headaches.  See December 2021 and June 2022 VA treatment records.  After receiving injections, the Veteran "noticed a decrease in her headaches and the intensity of the pain" but she continued to report anywhere from one to four migraines a week that require she lie down.  See October 2019 and April 2021 VA examination report; June 2022 VA treatment records.  In March 2022, the Veteran stated she had "two to three sometimes bad weeks" which "varies with severe headaches per week."  See March 2022 VA treatment records.  Despite the Veteran's continued treatment, the record reflects her migraines persisted.

The Board finds multiple migraines a week would greatly inhibit the Veteran's ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment in the fields for which she is qualified.  Realistically, the Veteran may be able to successfully maintain a job if she could select her own hours and work at her own pace, as this would allow her to work around her migraines which have no reported trigger.  However, an individual in any typical unskilled labor or customer service position cannot work their own hours.  This is also true in a hospital setting.  Assuming the Veteran suffered a migraine lasting hours or days during a typical work shift, she would not remain employed for long if she had to lie down during every migraine and wait for medication to reduce her symptoms.  A morning migraine would prevent her from timely arriving to work and she would have an increase in absences due to the prolonged nature of her migraine attacks.  Finally, if the Veteran could work through her migraines, she would likely be distracted and unable to fully concentrate for the duration of an attack.

Providing the Veteran with the benefit of the doubt, her migraines cause severe economic inadaptability to the severity that frequent attacks, especially without medication, prevent substantial employment.  The Board grants entitlement to TDIU based solely on her service-connected migraines.

SMC

SMC at the housebound rate is payable where a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and: (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The Veteran is already in receipt of SMC at the statutory housebound rate from October 28, 2020.  See July 2022 rating decision codesheet.  Thus, the Board will only consider prior to October 28, 2020.

Pursuant to the Order above, the Board has awarded TDIU based solely on the Veteran's service-connected migraines and the Veteran's other service-connected conditions create a combined rating of at least 60 percent during the appeal period.  Id. (persistent depressive disorder rated at 50 percent disabling prior to October 28, 2020 and 70 percent thereafter, sinusitis rated at 30 percent, right ankle fracture rated at 10 percent, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) rated at 10 percent disabling).  Accordingly, as both elements of entitlement to SMC at the (s) rate have been shown, the Board grants entitlement to SMC at the statutory housebound (s) rate prior to October 28, 2020.
