ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but not earlier, for the grant of service connection for urinary incontinence is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his urinary incontinence was manifest on January 20, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of January 20, 2022, for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1980 to October 1984.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for urinary incontinence that was most recently addressed in an April 2023 Rating Decision.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted service connection for urinary incontinence, effective February 2, 2024, based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim for an earlier effective date for service connection for urinary incontinence, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence is granted.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for his service-connected urinary incontinence.  In particular, the Veteran believes that the effective date for service connection should be the date that he filed his claim for service connection.  See June 2024 Written Statement.  In the Veteran's written statement, he references that he submitted his claim for service connection in December 2022.  

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A submission of an application form prescribed by the Secretary, whether paper or electronic, must meet the requirements of a complete claim as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160.  A complete claim is required for all types of claims, and will generally be considered filed as of the date it was received by VA for an evaluation or award of benefits under the laws administered by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d).

A claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  Id.  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Id.  An intent to file a claim must identify the general benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) but need not identify the specific benefit claimed or any medical condition(s) on which the claim is based.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(2).

If within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a) appropriate to the benefit sought, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  While the Veteran filed an August 2020 intent to file a claim, his initial claim for service connection for urinary incontinence was not submitted until January 19, 2023.  As such, an earlier effective date based on the above regulations are not applicable.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

A claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing one of the following administrative review options after any decision by the AOJ, Board, or by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), provided that any appeal to the Court is timely filed as determined by the Court: (1) following the notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, the claimant may file a supplemental claim, request a higher-level review, or appeal to the Board; (2) following notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board; (3) following notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court; and (4) following a decision on an appeal to the Court, the claimant may file a supplemental claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  The implementing regulation provides, in pertinent part, and with certain exceptions not applicable here, that the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the above available review options within one year of the issuance of the decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  If the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance, which includes but is not limited to equipoise, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  If the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, there is not an approximate balance, and therefore the benefit-of-the-doubt-rule does not apply.  Id. at 781-82.

Here, on December 29, 2022 the Veteran submitted a claim for an increased rating for his service-connected lumbar spine degenerative arthritis with degenerative disc disease, intervertebral disc syndrome, spinal stenosis, and retrolisthesis (lumbar spine disorder).  In the rating decision on appeal, he was awarded service connection for urinary incontinence as secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine disorder.  

?

The Board notes that ratings assigned for disabilities of the spine should evaluate any associated neurological abnormalities, including bladder impairment, separately under an appropriate diagnostic code (see General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Note (1)).  

An April 2023 Rating Decision proposed to reduce the disability rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disorder and denied service connection for urinary incontinence to include as secondary to the service-connected lumbar spine disorder.  The Veteran then filed a November 2023 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.  The March 2024 Rating Decision granted service connection for urinary incontinence and assigned a February 2, 2024, effective date.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the issue of bladder impairment associated with his lumbar spine disability since the filing of his claim for an increased rating for his lumbar spine disability on December 29, 2022.  

The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating the level of disability of increased rating claims, as is the case here, is from one year before the claim was filed; in this case, December 29, 2021, one year prior to the Veteran's December 29, 2022, claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

When granting service connection, the AOJ set an effective date of February 2, 2024.  See March 2024 Rating Decision.  This was the date that the February 2024 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with urinary incontinence.  See February 2024 Urinary Tract (Including Bladder and Urethra) Conditions (Excluding Male Reproductive System) Disability Benefits Questionnaire.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the February 2023 Urinary Tract (Including Bladder and Urethra) Conditions (Excluding Male Reproductive System) Disability Benefits Questionnaire demonstrates that the Veteran reported the onset of his urinary tract symptoms as February 2022.  He advised of a sudden urge to urinate, followed by an involuntary loss of urine.  He also provided that he urinates frequently and sometimes feels as though his bladder does not empty completely.  He indicated that his symptoms occur at least once per month.

In a February 2023 written statement, the Veteran stated that his urinary incontinence has worsened since he received treatment for his lower back in February 2022.  He advised that his lower back pain has led to increased difficulty with urinary incontinence.  He stated that he can barely get to the bathroom to urinate.  He described "mishaps" and leakage due to his inability to hold his urination.  He provided that he often must seek a bathroom with urgency to urinate and on occasion he is unable to reach the restroom prior to urination.

In a February 2023 written statement, the Veteran's spouse indicated that she has witnessed the Veteran rushing to the bathroom to urinate and that sometimes he urinates prior to reaching the bathroom.

In an April 2023 VA treatment record, the Veteran reported that he had an urgency to urinate and experienced episodes of incontinence.  In VA treatment records beginning in October 2023, the Veteran reported that he would like to treat his urinary incontinence, which has been present since 2014.  The Veteran described his symptoms as an urgency to urinate, where he has to hurry to the restroom to avoid leaking.  He indicated that he experiences a slow stream of urine, stops and starts, terminal dribbling, and a feeling that he cannot empty well.  He also advised that he urinates two times per night between midnight and 6 a.m.  

The Veteran's VA treatment records demonstrate that on January 20, 2022, he was referred for a physical therapy consultation for bilateral hip, low back, bilateral knee, and ankle pain.  The request was approved, to include pelvic rehabilitation for fecal or urinary incontinence, pelvic prolapse, urogenital abnormality, or other complaint requiring pelvic floor physical therapy.  The Veteran's VA treatment records prior to this time demonstrate that he denied bladder incontinence, to include in August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, and November 2021.  Further, he thereafter denied symptoms of bladder incontinence in April 2022, May 2022, June 2022, July 2022, August 2022, September 2022, October 2022, and November 2022. 

The February 2024 VA Urinary Tract (Including Bladder and Urethra) Conditions (Excluding Male Reproductive System) Disability Benefits Questionnaire states that the Veteran reported the onset of his urinary incontinence symptoms as 2014.  He advised of historical symptoms of urgency to urinate, episodes of dribbling, and a sensation that he does not empty well when urinating.  He provided that currently he has urinary incontinence, urgency, episodes of dribbling, feeling not completely empty after urinating, and urinating every hour during the day and five times per night between 8 p.m. and 3 a.m.

The Board finds that there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding whether an effective date of January 20, 2022, is warranted for the grant of service connection for urinary incontinence, as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  A VA treatment note shows that he was referred for pelvic rehabilitation on this date, although he thereafter denied experiencing any urinary incontinence from April 2022 through April 2023.  However, the lay evidence of record consistently points to a finding that the Veteran's urinary incontinence was present prior to the filing of his claim for an increased rating on December 29, 2022.  In support, the written statements from the Veteran and his spouse were submitted shortly after the claim was filed and reference ongoing symptoms.  Thus, an effective date of January 20, 2022, for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence is warranted.  

While the Veteran has reported symptoms of urinary incontinence since 2014, there is no evidence of complaints or findings of urinary incontinence between December 29, 2021 and January 20, 2022.  Further, during the year prior to the beginning of the appellate period beginning on December 29, 2021, the Veteran specifically denied symptoms of bladder incontinence in August 2021, September 2021, October 2021, and November 2021.  The Board finds these statement made during the course of seeking treatment to be credible.  As such, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against the presence of symptoms of urinary incontinence between December 29, 2021 and January 20, 2022; therefore, entitlement to an effective date prior to January 20, 2022 is denied.

In sum, resolving the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran, the competent and credible lay evidence concerning the Veteran's urinary incontinence symptoms demonstrates that his urinary incontinence was present on January 20, 2022, during the one-year period prior to receipt of his claim for an increased rating for his lumbar spine disorder on December 29, 2022.  Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.  Thus, entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.
