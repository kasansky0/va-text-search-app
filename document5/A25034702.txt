ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hyperthyroidism is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The issues of entitlement to service connection for hyperthyroidism is not addressed in any appealable rating decision within one year prior to the Veteran's July 2024 VA Form 10182.  

2. Hypercholesterolemia is a laboratory finding and not a disease or injury for Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation purposes. 

3. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was at least as likely as not incurred during service.

4. The Veteran's OSA was caused by or is the result of his service-connected psychiatric disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for hyperthyroidism have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 19.2, 20.301. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1101, 1110, 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310. 

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.385.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for OSA have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Navy from September 1988 to January 1999.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) decision on their claim to seek review.? The AMA applies to all?initial?decisions issued after February 19, 2019.?? 

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from numerous rating decisions issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).? The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement to the Board in July 2024 in which he named a January 2020 decision as the decision on appeal.  

The Board notes that the Veteran has one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. 20.203.  Notice of the January 2020 rating decision was issued more than one year prior to the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  However, all but one of the issues identified by the Veteran were decided by the AOJ within one year of the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  His service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss was decided in a June 2024 rating decision.  His service connection claim for hypercholesterolemia was decided in a January 2024 rating decision.  His service connection claim for OSA was decided in an October 2023 rating decision.  The Board finds that the Veteran's mistake is harmless error and will proceed on the merits for these issues, and the timeliness of the Veteran's appeal for hyperthyroidism will be addressed in depth below.  

The Veteran requested the direct review docket, which limits the Board's review to evidence of record at the time of the rating decisions on appeal.

The Board notes that the Veteran's service connection claims were previously denied in February 2023, July 2022, and January 2020.  In the June 2024, January 2024, and October 2023 rating decisions, the AOJ adjudicated the Veteran's claims on the merits.  Implicit in this action is a finding that new and relevant evidence sufficient to warrant readjudication had been received. The Board will not disturb this favorable finding. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

I. Claim Processing Rules

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  Except as otherwise provided, a claimant or his or her authorized representative, if any, who disagrees with a prior VA decision may file a supplemental claim (see § 3.1(p)(2)) by submitting in writing or electronically a complete application (see § 3.160(a)) on a form prescribed by the Secretary any time after the AOJ issues notice of a decision, regardless of whether the claim is pending (see § 3.160(c)) or has become finally adjudicated (see § 3.160(d)). 

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the AMA. This law created a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review.  Under the AMA system, except as provided in 38 C.F.R. § 20.402 for simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed NOD with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. 20.203. 

In Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that VA regulations requiring veterans to follow certain procedures in filing appeals do not limit the Board's jurisdiction. Rather, the Court described those regulations as "akin to claims-processing rules" that govern the orderly processing of cases but do not implicate jurisdiction. Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333. According to the Court, therefore, VA regulations requiring specific procedure for filing appeals should be treated as "less stringent" claims-processing rules that may be forfeited or waived.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hyperthyroidism

In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and identified hyperthyroidism as an issue on appeal from a January 2020 rating decision.  The Veteran did not file a timely appeal and no new or material evidence was received by VA or constructively in its possession within one year of written notice to the Veteran of the adverse decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).  Therefore, the decision became final.  As the Veteran's July 2024 10182 Notice of Disagreement was filed more than 4 years later, the Board finds that appeal of this rating decision is untimely.  

The Board notes that the Veteran filed a supplemental claim in October 2023 for entitlement to service connection for hyperthyroidism.  In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ deferred the issue for clarification of a medical opinion, and it has not yet decided the Veteran's claim.  The Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the decision of an AOJ to defer a ruling until a later date does not constitute a final decision by the agency, because all factual and legal questions relevant to the claim have been reserved for adjudication at a later date. Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458 (2011).  In other words, a decision that merely refers to future action is not a determination by the AOJ.  Therefore, the filing of a Notice of Disagreement on such a decision does not place the issue in appellate status.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the procedural requirements for review were not met as there is no appealable decision for this claim on record. Thus, the Board finds that the matters must be dismissed due to the procedural defect involving the claims-processing rules.  Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).

II. Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.?38?U.S.C. §?1110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement.?Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting?Shedden?v.?Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in a denial of service connection.

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of a veteran's service as shown by his or her service records, the official history of each organization in which he or she served, his or her medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (a); see also Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007) and Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.?38?C.F.R. §?3.385.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia 

The Veteran filed a service connection claim for hypercholesterolemia in August 2023.  However, the Board finds that service connection cannot be established for hypercholesterolemia.  

Hypercholesterolemia is a diagnosis for laboratory findings of elevated cholesterol in the blood. The VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities does not identify hypercholesterolemia as a separate disability for rating purposes, and it is not a disability for which VA compensation benefits are payable. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20440, 20445 (May 7, 1996) (Diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol are laboratory results and are not disabilities), see also 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  

The Board notes that symptoms, such as pain, causing functional impairment of earning capacity could be considered a disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  In other words, a disability can be established for a symptom not identified in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Larson v. McDonough, 10 F.4th 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2021).   However, an abnormal clinical finding on its own without any underlying pathology, symptoms, or functional limitations does not constitute a disability for VA compensation benefits.  See Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1363.  Here, the Veteran has not identified any symptoms or limitations related to his hypercholesterolemia.  

Furthermore, the Veteran is service connected for a heart disability and rated at 30 percent under the General Formula for Diseases of the Heart.  Thus, even if the Veteran's hypercholesterolemia progressed into heart disease, his symptoms from heart disease are already being rated under the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's hypercholesterolemia, considered alone, is not a disability for which service connection can be established, and the Veteran's claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran?maintains?that his bilateral hearing loss?is related to service. The Board agrees and finds that service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.?? 

With respect to current disability,?the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the June 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of bilateral hearing loss, and the Board is bound by this favorable finding.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Accordingly, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied.

With respect to in-service incurrence, the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the June 2024 rating decision that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during his service.  Specifically, the Veteran had a military occupational specialty (MOS) of aircraft servicing and inspections.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Accordingly, the Board finds that the in-service incurrence element of the Veteran's claim has been established.

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's in-service incurrence and his current bilateral hearing loss.  

Addressing this question, VA examiners provided negative nexus opinions in May 2019 and January 2024.  These examiners noted that the Veteran had threshold shifts during service, but they concluded that the Veteran's separation examination did not demonstrate that the shifts were permanent.  

Contrary to these opinions, the record demonstrates that the Veteran experienced hearing loss during service.  In February 1989, the Veteran complained of hearing difficulty in both ears with vertigo.  Then, in June 1990, the Veteran was diagnosed with low frequency hearing loss.  The Veteran was placed on numerous profiles that required him to shield himself from noise for 15 to 40 hours at a time and test his hearing repeatedly.  It is true that the Veteran's hearing thresholds improved by the time he separated from service.  However, he continued to demonstrate signs of hearing loss.  Notably, he was diagnosed with mild hearing loss at the 6000 hertz frequency in 2002, which was just three years after his discharge from service.  

The VA examiners did not consider this evidence in rendering their opinion.  Thus, the Board finds that their opinions are inadequate.  See?Reonal?v. Brown,?5?Vet. App.?548 (1993).

Given that there is no adequate negative opinion, the evidence of hearing loss during service and shortly after discharge is highly probative in establishing a nexus.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a) (service connection must be considered on the basis of the places, types, and circumstances of his service as shown by his service records, the official history of each organization in which he served, his medical records, and all pertinent medical and lay evidence).

In sum, the weight of the evidence supports finding that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was incurred during his active service, and service connection is granted. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102; 3.303(a), (d).

3. Entitlement to service connection for OSA

The Veteran maintains that his OSA is directly related to service.  In the alternative, he maintains that his OSA is secondary to his service-connected depression.  The Board finds that the elements of service connection on a direct basis have been established.  Given that service connection is being granted on a direct basis, there is no need to address secondary service connection. 

With respect to current disability,?the AOJ rendered a favorable finding in the October 2023 rating decision that the Veteran has a current disability of OSA, and the Board is bound by this favorable finding.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104(b)(4), 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Accordingly, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied.? 

With respect to in-service incurrence, the Veteran maintains that symptoms of OSA began during service, including loud snoring, cessation of breathing during sleep, and disrupted sleep patterns.  The Veteran is competent to report symptoms and observable events within the realm of his personal knowledge.  Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 470-471 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377.  Furthermore, the Board finds no reason to doubt the credibility of these statements, as they are consistent with buddy statements submitted by his wife and two fellow officers.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the in-service incurrence element of this claim has been established.  

The remaining question is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's in-service incurrence and his current OSA.  The record contains a negative and positive opinion addressing this question.  Against a finding of a nexus, a VA examiner reasoned in June 2020 that the Veteran was not diagnosed with OSA until 2007, which was eight years following his discharge from service.  

In favor of a nexus, a private otolaryngologist documented in a March 2022 opinion the statements provided by the Veteran, his wife, and fellow service members, who indicated that the Veteran experienced interrupted sleep, loud snoring, cessation of breathing during sleep, and daytime sleepiness during service.  The doctor elaborated that the Veteran was diagnosed with OSA by sleep study in 2007, at which time the Veteran reported that his symptoms had begun several years prior.  Given this evidence, the doctor concluded that it is more likely than not that the Veteran's OSA is a direct result of his service.  

Given that the VA examiner did not consider the lay statements provided by the Veteran, his wife, and fellow service members, or the documentation of symptoms in treating records, the Board finds that the opinion is not adequate or probative.  Conversely, the private otolaryngologist considered this evidence and provided a complete rationale for his findings.  Thus, the Board finds that this opinion is highly probative.  

Thus, the weight of the evidence supports finding that the Veteran's OSA was incurred during his active service, and service connection is granted. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102; 3.303(a), (d).
