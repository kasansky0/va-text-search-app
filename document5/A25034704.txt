ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

In the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) did not reach a resolution on the issues of entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis and hypertension, respectively, but rather found that duty to assist errors occurred.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. There is no question of law or fact on the issue of service connection for tuberculosis from the March 2024 rating decision and this appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104; 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.205.

2. There is no question of law or fact on the issue of service connection for hypertension from the March 2024 rating decision and this appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104; 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from July 2002 to February 2008.         

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of November 2023 and December 2023 rating decisions.  In May 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a decision which found that duty to assist errors had been identified during the higher-level review process.  

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 and December 2023 AOJ decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis is dismissed. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is dismissed. 

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (the Appeals Modernization Act or AMA), Pub. Law 115-55, which created a new claims and appeals process for pursuing VA benefits.

The Board has jurisdiction in all matters where there is a question of law or fact necessary for a decision by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the Secretary to veterans or their dependents or survivors. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(c).

By way of background, the Veteran filed claims for service connection for tuberculosis on a direct basis as well as for hypertension as due to exposure to toxins and contaminants in Iraq in a July 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ). A November 2023 rating decision denied the claim for service connection for tuberculosis while a December 2023 rating decision denied the claim for hypertension. The Veteran then filed a January 2024 VA Form 20-0996 seeking service connection for tuberculosis and hypertension and review of the December 2023 rating decision. A May 2024 Higher-Level Review decision found that a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher level reviews of hypertension and tuberculosis. A September 2024 VA Form 10182 identified the issues on appeal as entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis and hypertension and the rating decisions on appeal as December 2023 and May 2024.

The Board finds that the May 2024 rating decision does not constitute an adjudication of a claim or an otherwise appealable decision. Specifically, it does not appear from the record that the AOJ adjudicated any service connection issue, including the ones listed in the September 2024 VA Form 10182, in the May 2024 rating decision. To the contrary, the May 2024 specifically states that the AOJ found that a duty to assist error had occurred and that additional development would be ordered for each disability. Without an initial decision, there is nothing to appeal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Therefore, the Board finds that the present appeal deriving from the September 2024 VA Form 10182 must be dismissed as it is an attempt to appeal something that is not a decision and not appealable.

Moreover, an October 2024 rating decision awarded service connection for tuberculosis and assigned an initial noncompensable rating, effective July 31, 2023; and awarded service connection for hypertension associated with toxic exposure risk activity participation and assigned an initial noncompensable rating, effective July 31, 2023. Such is a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal and were awarded on the same basis of the Veteran's claims; therefore, the issues of entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis and hypertension are moot. See Baughman v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 563, 566 (1991

Thus, the Board will dismiss the present appeal as being moot, as there is no decision to appeal and no case or controversy for the Board to decide and is a procedural defect in complying with a mandatory claims-processing rule. Accordingly, the appeals seeking entitlement to service connection for tuberculosis and hypertension are dismissed. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.21.
