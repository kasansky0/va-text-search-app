REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2017 to December 2021. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his service.

This appeal to the Board arose from February 2023 and March 2023 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

An NOD must be filed within one year of the issuance of notice of the decision of the AOJ. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(A). This law is a mandatory claims-processing rule. See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc) (considering the same section of the pre-amended "legacy" version of the statute). When an application for review is not in conformity with the timeliness requirement, it shall not be entertained. 38 U.S.C. § 7108. An exception exists if a claimant establishes "an adequate excuse" for the NOD's untimeliness, such as an extension request with good cause, waiver, forfeiture, or any other relevant factor. See Ferko, 37 Vet. App. 262; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333-34 (2021). An extension of the time limit may be granted after expiration of a time limit where the claimant presents good cause for why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

An extension of the period for filing a NOD or a request to modify a NOD may be granted for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203

In this matter, the June 2024 VA Form 10182 would be considered to be untimely concerning the February 2023 and March 2023 rating decisions. The Veteran has requested a time extension, providing multiple reasons for his untimely filing. See June 2024 VA Form 10182.

One of the reasons proffered is that he had been requesting medical records to prepare for his appeal. Again, the Board notes that the Veteran selected Direct Review Lane, which means that the Board cannot consider evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal. As such, those medical records would not have been considered in the appeal. Additionally, the Veteran has not explained how requesting medical records precluded him from filing a timely VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran also expressed that he moved early in the year for a job and was laid off. While the Board is sympathetic to this circumstance, the Veteran has not contended that the move or job loss prevented him from access to filing his appeal.

Next, the Veteran asserts that he was misinformed by someone at VA pertaining to the time period for filing an appeal, stating that he was told that he had two years to appeal instead of one. The Veteran indicates that he only became aware of the deadline when filing the appeal. The Board notes that a beneficiary is charged with knowing the rules governing compensation. Dent v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 362, 382 (2015); see also Jordan v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. at 174-75. Consequently, to the extent that the Veteran implies that he was unaware of the law is without merit, as ignorance of the law is no excuse. Bryan v. West, 13 Vet. App. 482, 486-87 (2000). The Supreme Court of the United States has held that everyone dealing with the government is charged with knowledge of federal statutes and lawfully promulgated agency regulations. Fed. Crop Ins. Corp v. Merrill, 332 U.S. 380, 384 (1947). Therefore, regulations are binding on all who seek to come within their sphere, "regardless of actual knowledge of what is in the [r]egulations or of the hardship resulting from innocent ignorance." Id. at 385.

Additionally, the Veteran was notified of his rating decisions in letters. The record does not indicate, nor does the Veteran assert, that he did not receive those notification letters. These letters provide information pertaining to his decisions, such as his appellate rights. In the February 2023 and April 2023 notification letters, the AOJ informed the Veteran that he had one year from the date of the notification letters to file an appeal. As such, the record shows that the Veteran was properly informed by VA regarding the time period to file his appeal, and the presumption of regularity, under which it is presumed that government officials "have properly discharged their official duties", remains intact. United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15 (1926), Ashley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 307, 308 (1992).

The Veteran also states that looking at computer or phone screens worsens his headaches, resulting in him not spending a lot of time on the internet or his phone. While he asserts that he was not able to spend a lot of time on the internet or his phone, he does not contend that he was completely prevented in using the computer or another device to access the appropriate database to file his appeal. The evidence does not show any incapacitation during the applicable time period to file the appeal. Also, the Board acknowledges that in June 2023, the Veteran submitted a dependency claim, using the online database, eBenefits. See June 2023 VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents). This claim was filed during the time period in which he could timely file the VA Form 10182 pertaining to the February 2023 and March 2023 rating decisions.

Lastly, the Board has considered whether waiver or forfeiture to the procedural requirements are present in this matter. In the July 2024 BVA Docketing Letter, the Board informs that although the appeal has been docketed, it is possible that upon more detailed review that the Board will determine that the appeal request does not meet the necessary procedural requirement, such as timely submitting of appeal request. The Board advised the Veteran that if the Board identifies such a defect, it may issue a decision dismissing appeal due to the defect. Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been no waiver or forfeiture of the procedural requirements in this matter. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reasons for his untimely filing. The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran. Unfortunately, the Board finds that those reasons do not show good cause, in accordance with governing laws and regulations. The Board must apply "the law as it exists, and cannot 'extend . . . benefits out of sympathy for a particular [claimant].'" See Owings v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 17, 23 (1995), quoting Kelly v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 171, 172 (1992).

Accordingly, as the Board finds that the Veteran did not comply with the applicable claims processing rules and has not provided good cause in failing to do so, the appeal is dismissed.
