ORDER

Service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

?

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2012 to May 2022.

The case is on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision.

In a May 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran selected the Direct Review option.  Therefore, the Board has considered the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

A diagnosis shortly before the date of a claim for compensation may be sufficient evidence of a present disability.  See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

Analysis

The Veteran contends that service connection for erectile dysfunction is warranted.  See November 2022 claim. 

The Veteran was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction during a July 2022 VA examination, four months prior to his November 2022 claim for VA compensation.  As there is no evidence suggesting the condition resolved prior to the Veteran's claim, the Board finds the July 2022 VA examination sufficient evidence of a present disability as it was close in time to the date of claim.  See Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. at 294.

During the July 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his erectile dysfunction began in 2020, when the Veteran was serving on active duty.  The Veteran is competent to report the onset of lay-observable symptoms, and the in-service incurrence element has therefore been established.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994)   

Regarding nexus, there are VA opinions of record addressing whether the Veteran's disability is related to his service-connected adjustment disorder or an in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), but no opinion has addressed whether the Veteran's present disability is related to the symptoms of erectile disfunction he experienced during service.  Nevertheless, particularly considering the proximity of the Veteran's diagnosis to his separation from active duty, the Board finds the lay evidence in this case is sufficient to establish a connection between the Veteran's present disability and his symptoms observed during service.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

The Veteran separated from active duty in May 2022.  As previously noted, he was diagnosed with erectile dysfunction just two months later during a July 2022 VA examination.  The Veteran informed the examiner that the condition began in 2020 while on active duty.  The Veteran is competent to report the onset and recurrence of lay-observable symptoms such as erectile dysfunction.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470.  

Therefore, based on the competent evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction began during active service.  This is particularly so when reasonable doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, service connection for erectile dysfunction warranted.
