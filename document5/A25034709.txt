ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for scars, residuals, skin cancer, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran died in October 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for scars, residuals, skin cancer, must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C.              § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to March 1973 and has prior unverified service.

In its February 2018 rating decision, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied entitlement to service connection for skin cancer, and scars, as residuals of skin cancer.  The Veteran disagreed with such 

in his February 2018 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), and the AOJ, in January 2020, issued a Statement of the Case (SOC).  The Veteran submitted a March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (NOD) as to entitlement to service connection for scars, residuals, skin cancer, to opt-in to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system from the January 2020 SOC; an appeal deemed timely by the Board herein under provisions extending filing deadlines during the COVID-19 pandemic. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).

Entitlement to service connection for scars, residuals, skin cancer.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for scars, residuals, skin cancer.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302 (a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim.  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000 (a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the Veteran.  While more than one year has passed since the Veteran's death, any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.  

If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the Veteran's death 

?

and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302 (a).
