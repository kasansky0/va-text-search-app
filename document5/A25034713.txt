ORDER

Entitlement to a 10 percent evaluation for rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux,  is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux manifests as a 50 percent or greater obstruction of either side, without polyps or complete obstruction of one side of the nasal passage.

2. The Veteran had active duty service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations after August 2, 1990.

3. The Veteran does not have a diagnosis of sinusitis.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial, 10 percent disability evaluation, but no higher, for rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1119, 1120, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.320.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 2004 to November 2008.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  The rating decision in this case was issued after February 19, 2019; thus, the AMA framework applies.

In a December 7, 2021 rating decision, in pertinent part, the AOJ awarded the Veteran service connection for rhinitis, and assigned a noncompensable disability evaluation, effective October 21, 2021.  The AOJ also denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on December 8, 2021.

The Veteran, on December 21, 2022, filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the December 2021 rating decision as to the disability evaluation assigned for the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis and denial of service connection for sinusitis.  A Higher-Level Review Informal Conference was held on January 13, 2022.

In a January 13, 2022 rating decision, the AOJ reviewed the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decision and denied the Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis and the Veteran's claim for service connection of sinusitis.  The Veteran was notified of this rating decision on January 14, 2022.

On October 20, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the January 2022 rating decision as to the denial of service connection for sinusitis.  A February 1, 2023 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on February 2, 2023.

On March 1, 2022, the Veteran submitted two VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the denial of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for the Veteran's rhinitis and review of the denial of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.  A June 14, 2023 rating decision recharacterized the Veteran's rhinitis as rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux and denied the Veteran's claims.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on June 16, 2023.

The Veteran, on November 27, 2023, filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review, requesting review of the June 2023 rating decision as to the disability evaluation assigned for the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis and the denial of service connection for sinusitis.  

In a March 27, 2024 rating decision, the AOJ reviewed the evidence of record at the time of the prior rating decision and denied the Veteran's claim for an increased disability evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis and the Veteran's claim for service connection of sinusitis.  The Veteran was notified of this decision on April 1, 2024.

The Veteran appealed the March 2024 rating decision to the Board by filing an April 26, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal.  The Veteran requested Direct Review.  On May 9, 2024, the Board acknowledged receipt of the Veteran's Board Appeal request (VA Form 10182).  Accordingly, under its review, the Board will now only consider all evidence of record at the time of the April 1, 2024 notice of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Duties to Notify and Assist

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by application of the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  An evaluation of the level of disability present must also include consideration of the functional impairment of the Veteran's ability to engage in ordinary activities, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  

Separate evaluations may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. In other words, the evaluations may be staged.  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  

3. Entitlement to an increased disability evaluation for rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux, currently rated as noncompensable.

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable (i.e., 0 percent) disability rating for rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.  

According to Diagnostic Code 6522, the minimum compensable rating of 10 percent is warranted for allergic rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A 30 percent disability evaluation requires polyps.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

Upon reviewing these rating criteria in relation to the evidence for consideration, the Board finds that the disability picture for the Veteran's service-connected rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux is most consistent with a 10 percent disability rating, for the entire rating period on appeal (since October 21, 2021).  The Board acknowledges that the objective clinical evidence of record does not show that the Veteran experiences nasal polyps, thus a 30 percent rating is not warranted. As for a 10 percent evaluation, the objective medical evidence of record is mixed as to whether the Veteran experiences at least 50 percent obstruction of either nasal passage; nasal obstruction was not shown at the November 2021 and June 2023 VA examinations.  However, the November 2022 and April 2023 VA examination reports reflect that the Veteran experiences at least 50 percent obstruction of either nasal passage.  Likewise, the November 2022 and April 2023 VA examination reports indicate that the Veteran has permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates.  Moreover, the Board observes that the record reflects that the Veteran has consistently reported experiencing chronic nasal congestion, post-nasal drips, frequent throat clearing, clear rhinorrhea, watery eye, sneezing, and cough.  The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and has presented credible statements in this regard. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  

The Board notes that the November 2021, November 2022, April 2023, and June 2023 VA examinations were negative for granulomatous conditions and rhinoscleroma, and thus, an increased disability evaluation under other diagnostic codes governing respiratory disabilities is not warranted in this case.  

Therefore, the Board finds that the symptoms of the Veteran's rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux most closely approximate the criteria for a 10 percent disability evaluation, but no higher, for the entire rating period on appeal.  	

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.  For chronic diseases, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge is required to support the claim.  38 C.F.R. § § 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).	

4. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is denied.

The Board acknowledges that, since the Veteran initially submitted his claim, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted on August 10, 2022.  The PACT Act defined "covered veteran" to include veterans who served in Iraq and Kuwait on or after August 2, 1990 and who served in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. 38 U.S.C. § 1119(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).  The Board notes that an April 2023 VA memorandum indicates that the Veteran is a "Persian Gulf Veteran" per 38 U.S.C. § 1117.  Additionally, in December 2022, VA also issued a memorandum stating that the DoD had provided VA with authoritative data that verified that the Veteran had military service that constituted presumptive toxic exposure per 38 U.S.C. § 1119.  He is thus a covered veteran under the PACT Act.  

The Board notes that the March 2024 rating decision noted the following favorable findings:  the Veteran served in Southwest Asia (service records show service in Afghanistan and Kuwait); the claimed disability, sinusitis, is a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to military service exposure; the Veteran was exposed to burn pits and/or particulate matter during military service; and that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) is conceded.  The Board will not disturb these favorable findings.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that whether service connection is claimed on direct or secondary basis, a necessary element for establishing such a claim is the existence of current disability.  In this case, the Veteran must show that he currently has sinusitis due to an event, disease, or injury in service.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran reports experiencing sinusitis, and that the Veteran's post-service treatment records and VA examination reports reflect that the Veteran reported experiencing chronic congestion since service.  However, there is no evidence reflecting that he has been clinically diagnosed with sinusitis during or since service.  In this regard, the Board points out that the Veteran's service treatment records and post-service VA treatment records do not reflect any diagnoses of sinusitis.  Moreover, the Board observes that the November 2021, November 2022, April 2023, and June 2023 VA examiners found that there was no evidence of sinusitis; the examiners acknowledged that the Veteran had complaints of chronic congestion and sinus pressure but concluded, following physical examination of the Veteran and imaging, that there was no evidence that the Veteran had sinusitis; November 2021 x-rays were negative.  Moreover, the Board observes that the Veteran's complaints of congestion were attributed to his service-connected rhinitis with laryngopharyngeal reflux.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  See also Brady v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 203, 206 (1993) (a claimant may not be compensated twice for the same symptomatology as "such a result would overcompensate the claimant for the actual impairment of his earning capacity.")  Thus, there is no evidence of sinusitis at any time during the appeal period.  

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has noted that in order for a veteran to qualify for entitlement to compensation under those statutes, he or she must prove existence of a disability, and one that has resulted from a disease or injury that occurred in the line of duty.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a disability).   Here, we are faced with related complaints, without any competent evidence of in-service or post-service pathology (diagnosis).  

In short, the evidence fails to show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of sinusitis which is causally or etiologically related to his service.  See Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (a Veteran seeking disability benefits must establish the existence of a disability and a connection between such Veteran's service and the disability).

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements.  However, the Veteran's statements are insufficient to establish that the Veteran has sinusitis related to his service.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms such as congestion, but he is not competent to determine the cause of his symptoms.  Such determinations require more than mere observation of symptoms, but medical training and knowledge which the Veteran does not have.  Further, the Veteran is not competent to diagnose sinusitis.  This disability requires medical testing and training to diagnose. Thus, his lay assertions of diagnoses and nexus are not competent evidence as to the claim. Therefore, the evidence does not support a finding of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis.  Accordingly, the claim is denied.  See Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (1997).
