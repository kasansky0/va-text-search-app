FINDINGS OF FACT

1. No formal claim for service connection for right knee disability was received prior to December 14, 2021. 

2. An August 2021 rating decision granted service connection for right hip disability effective December 21, 2019; no appeal or review request was filed as to this decision. 

3. No formal claim for service connection for right lower extremity scars was received prior to December 14, 2021. 

4. The evidence shows that when considering the Veteran's pain and functional loss, his cervical spine limitation of motion was manifested by flexion to, at worse, 35 degrees and a combined range of motion of 255 degrees; the evidence does reveal muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour or incapacitating episodes of intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS). 

5. The evidence shows that when considering the Veteran's pain and functional loss, including after repeated use over time, his right knee limitation of motion was manifested by flexion to, at worse, 115 degrees. 

6. The Veteran's right lower extremity scars do not cover an area of 144 square inches or greater; none of his scars were painful or unstable. 

7. The evidence shows that when considering the Veteran's pain and functional loss, his right hip limitation of motion was manifested by flexion to, at worse, 90 degrees, and extension to, at worse, 20 degrees. 

8. The evidence shows that when considering the Veteran's pain and functional loss, his right thigh impairment was not manifested by limitation of rotation, adduction, or abduction.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2016 to December 2019. 

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated that he was appealing the December 2022 rating decision, and the "area of disagreement" was "service connection" as to the claims discussed herein. As the Veteran is already service-connected for his right hip disabilities, right knee disability, neck disability, and right lower extremity scars, the Board has liberally construed the VA Form 10182 as challenging the assigned evaluations for these conditions. 

Earlier Effective Date

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall be no earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The statutory provision is implemented by regulation, which provides that the effective date for an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

If a Veteran submits to VA an Intent to File, VA will furnish the Veteran with the appropriate form to file their claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If an application is filed within one year of the Intent to File, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the Intent to File for effective date purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

VA amended its regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by VA, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). Those amendments are effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.

A claim adjudicated in a decision subject to the modernized review system (AMA) may be continuously pursued by timely filing an appropriate review request, which preserves the effective date of the claim. Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, generally within one year of an AMA decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right knee disability. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than December 14, 2021, for the award of service connection for right knee disability. 

By way of procedural background, VA received an Intent to File on December 14, 2021. Thereafter, VA received the Veteran's formal claim for service connection for right knee disability on October 5, 2022. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. In the December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right knee disability and assigned an effective date of December 14, 2021. The Veteran filed the instant notice of disagreement contesting the assigned effective date. 

Based on the evidence, and the laws and regulations, the Board does not find that an earlier effective date is warranted as the earliest possible effective date has already been assigned for right knee disability. The record does not reflect that VA received an application for service connection for right knee disability, or a notice of intent to file, prior to December 14, 2021. Additionally, Veteran has not alleged that an application or a notice of intent to file was submitted prior to December 14, 2021. The Board also notes that the Veteran has not presented any specific argument as to what effective date is being sought or why an earlier effective date is warranted.  

In sum, December 14, 2021, is the earliest date for the award of service connection for right knee disability. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. As such, the claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for right lower extremity scars. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than December 14, 2021, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity scars. 

By way of procedural background, in an August 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right hip disability and assigned an effective date of December 21, 2019. The Veteran did not file an appeal or a review request (supplemental claim or higher-level review request) as to this rating decision. On December 14, 2021, VA received an Intent to File. Thereafter, VA received the Veteran's formal claim for an increased rating for right hip disability on October 5, 2022. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. In the December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right lower extremity scars as related to his right hip disability and assigned an effective date of December 14, 2021. The Veteran filed the instant notice of disagreement contesting the assigned effective date. 

Based on the evidence, and the laws and regulations, the Board does not find that an earlier effective date is warranted as the earliest possible effective date has already been assigned for right lower extremity scars. There was no continuous pursuit of his claim for an increased rating for right hip disability (and its related conditions) as a VA Form 10182 or review request was not submitted within one-year of the August 2021 rating decision. Rather, the Veteran filed an intent to file on December 14, 2021, and filed a complete VA Form 21-526EZ in October 2022. The Board notes that a VA Form 21-526EZ is not an appropriate form for continuous pursuit based on the regulations. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.2500; Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

The record does not reflect that VA received an application for service connection for right lower extremity scars, or a notice of intent to file, prior to December 14, 2021. Additionally, Veteran has not alleged that an application or a notice of intent to file was submitted prior to December 14, 2021. The Board also notes that the Veteran has not presented any specific argument as to what effective date is being sought or why an earlier effective date is warranted.  

In sum, December 14, 2021, is the earliest date for the award of service connection for right lower extremity scars. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. As such, the claim for an earlier effective date is denied. 

Increased Rating

A disability rating is determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. VA has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record, and to explain the reasons and bases for its conclusions. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  However, separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. This practice is known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

3. Entitlement to an increased rating for neck disability. 

The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent rating for neck disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5237. 

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. Id. at Note 1.  

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012). Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis. Id. at Note 5.  

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022, in which he reported having aching pain, straining, and less movement. The examiner noted that the Veteran was not undergoing current treatment for his neck disability and did not experience flare-ups. The Veteran reported having limited motion while driving and his neck popping during motion. Initial range of motion testing revealed active and passive range of motion of forward flexion to 35 degrees, extension to 40 degrees, right lateral flexion to 30 degrees, left lateral flexion to 30 degrees, right lateral rotation to 60 degrees, and left lateral rotation to 60 degrees. No additional functional loss was identified on repetitive use testing. Regarding repeated use over time, the examiner opined that the procured evidence (statements from the Veteran) did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack or endurance, or incoordination significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time. The examiner noted localized tenderness and muscle spasm not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour. There was no evidence of guarding, reduction in muscle strength, muscle atrophy, radicular pain or other neurologic abnormalities, ankylosis, or IVDS of the cervical spine. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for neck disability. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees or combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees. Additionally, the Veteran did not have muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. Throughout the review period, the Veteran exhibited, at worse, forward flexion to 35 degrees, and a combined range of motion of the cervical spine of 255 degrees. Importantly, after observing the Veteran's range of motion during the examination and considering the Veteran's statements as to his symptomology and functional ability, the October 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not have additional functional loss after repetitive use over time. The Board finds that the October 2022 VA examination represents an accurate picture of the Veteran's neck disability as the examiner adequately considered and opined as to the Veteran's functional ability. Additionally, the evidence does not reveal guarding and while the Veteran was noted to have muscle spasm, the VA examiner indicated that it did not result in abnormal gait or spinal contour. Lastly, the evidence of record does not indicate the presence of ankylosis, and the Veteran has not alleged that he has had ankylosis at any time during the appeal period. There is no medical evidence that the Veteran has a diagnosis of ankylosis or that his symptoms more nearly approximate the cervical spine fixed in flexion or extension and one of the additional symptoms set forth in Note 5. Accordingly, the evidence does not reveal a range of motion akin to ankylosis or functional equivalent thereof. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021).

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes. However, the Veteran does not have IVDS, and the evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes. 

Regarding neurological impairment, the lay and medical evidence of record is against finding that the Veteran has any neurological abnormality associated with his cervical spine disability.

In sum, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for neck disability. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

4. Entitlement to an increased rating for right knee disability. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial 10 percent rating for right knee disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5260. 

Limitation of flexion of the leg is rated under C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260. Under Diagnostic Code 5260, a noncompensable rating is warranted for flexion limited to 60 degrees. A 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 15 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260.  

Normal range of motion of the knee is from 0 degrees of extension to 140 degrees of flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Turning to the evidence of record, a June 2022 VA primary care telephone encounter note indicated the Veteran reported experiencing knee pain, shaking, and tenderness. He stated that his left knee was weaker.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022. He reported having aching pain, straining to bend over, and restricted movement. The examiner noted that the Veteran was not undergoing current treatment for his right knee disability, did not experience flare-ups, or report or have a history of instability or recurrent subluxation of the knee. Initial range of motion testing revealed active and passive range of motion of forward flexion to 120 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. No additional functional loss was identified on repetitive use testing. Regarding repeated use over time, the examiner opined that pain significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time and estimated the Veteran's range of motion to be flexion to 115 degrees and extension to 0 degrees. There was no evidence of ankylosis, muscle atrophy, recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, ligament tear, recurrent patellar instability, a tibial or fibular impairment, or meniscus condition. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee disability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5260. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to pain, weakened movement, repetitive use, and pain during repetitive use over time. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating flexion limited to 30 degrees, which is required for the next higher rating under Diagnostic Code 5260. Throughout the review period, the Veteran exhibited, at worse, flexion to 115 degrees. Specifically, the October 2022 VA examiner estimated that the Veteran's right knee flexion would be limited to 115 degrees after repeated use over time after observing the Veteran's range of motion during the examination and considering the Veteran's statements regarding his symptomology and functional ability. The Board finds that the October 2022 VA examination represents an accurate picture of the Veteran's right knee disability as the examiner adequately considered and opined as to the Veteran's functional ability. Additionally, the Veteran has not reported experiencing flare-ups of the right knee during the applicable review period. 

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the knee and leg. Other disability ratings may be assigned only if the symptomatology for a disability is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of any other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.14 prohibits paying compensation twice for the same symptoms or functional impairment). 

Here, the Veteran's lay statements, medical treatment records, and VA examination do not suggest the presence of ankylosis in the right knee. The VA examination report specifically documents that the Veteran did not have ankylosis in the right knee, and the medical evidence does not suggest that his right knee is in a fixed position or ankylosed. The evidence also does not reveal a range of motion akin to ankylosis. Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). Accordingly, Diagnostic Code 5256 is not applicable.  

Additionally, there is no evidence of dislocated semilunar cartilage with episodes of "locking," pain and effusion; symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage; limitation of extension; impairment of the tibia and fibula; or genu recurvatum at any time during the review period on appeal. Accordingly, separate ratings under Diagnostic Codes 5258, 5259, 5261, 5262, and 5263 are not warranted. 

Moreover, neither the lay nor medical evidence suggests that the Veteran's right knee warrants a separate rating for instability pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5257. In this regard, the Veteran has reported knee shaking. Additionally, during the October 2022 VA examination he indicated knee popping due to his service-connected hip disability. The October 2022 VA examination report does not contain any objective evidence of instability or subluxation, despite medical testing done to reveal any such symptoms. In this case, the Board affords greater probative weight to the medical evidence surrounding the presence of instability of the right knee due to the greater training and expertise of the examiner than that of the Veteran. Thus, even considering lay evidence, the Board finds there is insufficient evidence upon which to base a separate award for instability of the knees. English v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 347 (2018).

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee disability. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

5. Entitlement to an increased rating for right lower extremity scars. 

The Veteran is in receipt of an initial noncompensable rating for right lower extremity scars pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7802. 

Diagnostic Code 7802 is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. A 10 percent rating is warranted when the area of the scar covers 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the Veteran's right lower extremity scars do not manifest an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Notably, the October 2022 VA examination noted that the Veteran's five scars of the right lower extremity cover an approximate total area of 5 sq. cm. 

The Board has considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. However, the Veteran's right lower extremity scars are not of the head, face, or neck, are not deep and non-linear, and are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Moreover, the Veteran's scars are not unstable or painful.  Therefore, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, and 7804 are inapplicable. Finally, the evidence of record shows there are no other disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 as contemplated Diagnostic Code 7805. Notably, the October 2022 VA examination report noted that the Veteran's scars were not tender to palpation, unstable, or painful, and had no impact on the Veteran's limitation of motion. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned rating reflects. While the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, he has not asserted, and the medical evidence does not show, that his scars are manifest by an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater or that his scars are painful or unstable. 

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for right lower extremity scars. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

6. Entitlement to an increased rating for right hip disabilities. 

As an initial matter, while the appeal was pending before the Board, a September 2024 rating decision granted a 10 percent rating for right hip limitation of flexion effective June 26, 2024, and reduced the Veteran's right hip limitation of extension from a 10 percent rating to a noncompensable rating effective June 26, 2024. As the review period for the instant appeal is limited to the period considered by the AOJ, the September 2024 rating decision does not impact the applicable review period, and the ratings assigned therein are not for consideration by the Board at this time. 

By way of procedural background, in an August 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right hip disability and assigned an effective date of December 21, 2019. The AOJ assigned an initial noncompensable rating for right thigh impairment pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5253, an initial noncompensable rating for right hip limitation of extension pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5251, and an initial 10 percent rating for right hip limitation of flexion based on painful motion pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5252. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. The Veteran did not file an appeal as to this rating decision. On December 14, 2021, VA received an Intent to File. Thereafter, in October 2022, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his right hip disabilities. See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the noncompensable rating for right thigh impairment, granted a 10 percent rating for right hip limitation of extension effective October 14, 2022 (the date of the VA examination), and reduced the Veteran's right hip limitation of flexion from a 10 percent rating to a noncompensable rating effective October 14, 2022. The Veteran filed the instant appeal as to this decision. 

The Board finds that the December 2022 rating decision did not represent a reduction in rating, but rather a change in Diagnostic Code for rating purposes. Thus, the Board concludes that the issue on appeal related to Diagnostic Code 5252, limitation of flexion, is not a reduction. Therefore, the procedural and substantive requirements for a reduction do not apply and need not be addressed. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5251, limitation of extension of thigh, a maximum 10 percent rating is warranted for extension of the thigh limited to 5 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5251.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5252, limitation of flexion of thigh, a 10 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 45 degrees. A 20 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 30 degrees. A 30 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 20 degrees. A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for flexion limited to 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5252.  

Under Diagnostic Code 5253, impairment of the thigh, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of affected leg, cannot toe out more than 15 degrees. A 10 percent rating is also warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs. A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction, motion lost beyond 10 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5253.  

Normal extension of the hip is to 0 degrees and normal flexion is to 125 degrees. Normal abduction is to 45 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2022, in which he reported experiencing pain and numbness. The examiner noted that the Veteran was not undergoing current treatment for his right hip disabilities and did not experience flare-ups. Regarding functional impairment, the Veteran reported having limited bending motions and ability to stand as well as consistent pressure. Initial range of motion testing revealed active and passive range of motion of flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, abduction to 45 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 60 degrees, and internal rotation to 40 degrees. The Veteran exhibited pain in flexion and extension. The examiner noted that limitation in adduction did not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs. No additional functional loss was identified on repetitive use testing. Regarding repeated use over time, the examiner opined that the procured evidence (statements from the Veteran) did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack or endurance, or incoordination significantly limits functional ability with repeated use over time. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, ankylosis, or femur or flail hip joint impairment. The examiner noted that the Veteran experienced difficulty with walking, sitting, standing, running, squatting, jumping, and walking stairs. 

Limitation of Motion

As previously discussed, the Veteran was in receipt of a 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion due to painful motion prior to October 14, 2022. In the December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ continued the 10 percent rating for painful motion of the right hip, but under Diagnostic Code 5251 for limitation of extension effective October 14, 2022, and assigned a noncompensable rating for limitation of flexion. Thus, while the AOJ has changed the Diagnostic Codes under which the Veteran's right hip painful motion has been compensated in an attempt to find the Diagnostic Code that best captures the Veteran's disability, the Board notes that the Veteran's disability has not changed nor has the actual manifestations of his right hip disability, which is painful motion of the right hip. 

Importantly, the Board notes that throughout the review period, the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran has met the criteria for a compensable rating under either Diagnostic Code 5252 or Diagnostic Code 5251. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms that there was functional loss due to pain and repetitive use. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximately flexion limited to 45 degrees or less, which is required for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5252, or extension limited to 5 degrees, which is required for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5251. Throughout the review period, the Veteran exhibited, at worse, flexion to 90 degrees, and extension to, at worse, 20 degrees. Importantly, after observing the Veteran's range of motion during the examination and considering the Veteran's statements as to his symptomology and functional ability, the October 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not have additional functional loss after repetitive use over time. The Board finds that the October 2022 VA examination represents an accurate picture of the Veteran's right hip limitation of motion as the examiner adequately considered and opined as to the Veteran's functional ability. Additionally, the Veteran has not reported experiencing flare-ups during the applicable review period.

The Board further notes that the circumstances in the instant case are distinguishable from the facts of Murray v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 420 (2011), as the Veteran's 10 percent right hip rating has been based on painful motion and painful limitation of motion in his right hip that did not rise to a compensable level under the relevant Diagnostic Codes. The Veteran's 10 percent rating for painful motion of the right hip has remained undisturbed since service connection was granted in December 2019. While the Diagnostic Codes under which that painful motion is compensated have changed, from Diagnostic Code 5252 to Diagnostic Code 5251, the underlying diagnosis and actual manifestations have remained the same (i.e., painful motion). In addition, the location, disability (limitation of motion due to pain) and compensation have remained consistent. Since the Veteran has continued to be in receipt of a 10 percent rating for his right hip disability for limitation of motion, and is currently in receipt of a minimum compensable rating for this disability based on limitation of motion, the Board finds that there has been no severance of compensation at the 10 percent level for the Veteran's right hip, that has been extant since December 2019, and 38 C.F.R. § 3.951(b) has not been violated. See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (finding that there was no severance where the Diagnostic Code was changed from Muscle Group XIII to XV to more accurately reflect situs of gunshot wound disability and the rating remained the same). 

The Board acknowledges and is sympathic that the changes in Diagnostic Code during the appeal period could have caused confusion; however, the Board reiterates that the Veteran has continuously been in receipt of a 10 percent for limited motion of the right hip. The criteria for a higher rating for limitation of motion have not been met at any point during the review period before the Board. 

Thigh Impairment

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a compensable rating for right thigh impairment pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5253. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms that there was functional loss due to pain and repetitive use. However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by these statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating a compensable rating. Here, the criteria for a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5253 have not been met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. Throughout the review period on appeal, the Veteran exhibited normal abduction, adduction, and rotation. Additionally, the examiner noted the Veteran was able to cross his legs. 

Other Considerations and Conclusion

Moreover, the Board has also considered whether higher ratings or additional separate ratings are warranted under other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the hip and thigh. Here, the Veteran's treatment records, and VA examination report do not indicate the presence of ankylosis in the right hip at any point during the review period. There is no medical evidence that the Veteran has a diagnosis of ankylosis or that his right hip is in a fixed position or ankylosed. The evidence also does not reveal a range of motion akin to ankylosis. See Chavis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 1 (2021). Accordingly, Diagnostic Code 5250 is not applicable. Additionally, the Board finds that evaluations under Diagnostic Codes 5254 or 5255 are not warranted as there is no evidence of a flail hip joint or malunion or nonunion of the femur.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's appeal for a compensable rating for right thigh impairment; a rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion prior to October 14, 2022, and a compensable rating thereafter; and a compensable rating for limitation of extension prior to October 14, 2022, and a rating in excess of 10 percent thereafter. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claims for increased rating are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
