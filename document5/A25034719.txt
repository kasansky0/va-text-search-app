ORDER

Entitlement to a temporary 100% rating for convalescence based on right ankle surgery, from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, is granted.

Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on statutory housebound criteria from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

Following the Veteran's June 2023, hospitalization, the Veteran was issued a doctor mandated convalescence until September 27, 2023.

The most probative evidence supports a finding that from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, the Veteran is in receipt of a total 100 percent rating for a temporary 100 percent disability rating and has had additional service-connected disabilities rated at least 60 percent disabling, which are separate and distinct from the right ankle disability and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a temporary 100 percent rating for convalescence based on a right ankle disability, from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.30.

The criteria for entitlement to SMC based on the statutory housebound criteria from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from August 1982, until September 1986.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. The Board notes that the Veteran specifically notes the March 19, 2024, rating decision is the rating decision being appealed. The Veteran also specifically notes that the issues on appeal are "entitlement to SMC and temp[orary] 100% of right ankle with ankylosis." Based on the issues noted by the Veteran, the Board will only address the issues that have been noted on the Veteran's appeal and will not be addressing any other claim of entitlement addressed in the March 19, 2024, rating decision.

In the August 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Temporary Total Ratings

A temporary total disability rating may be assigned under either 38 C.F.R. § 4.29 or 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.29, a temporary total disability rating will be assigned when it is established that a service-connected disability has required hospitalization at a VA medical center or other approved hospital for more than 21 days or for hospital observation at VA expense for a service-connected disability for more than 21 days. 38 C.F.R. § 4.29.

A temporary total disability rating may also be assigned for, effective from the date of a hospital admission and continuing for a period of 1, 2, or 3 months from the first day of the month following such hospital discharge, if the hospital treatment of a service-connected disability resulted in: (1) surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence, (2) surgery with respect to postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps and recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, or the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight-bearing prohibited), or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30 (a).

"Convalescence" has been defined as the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state.  Notations in the medical record as to a Veteran's incapacity to work after surgery may be taken into account in the evaluation of a claim brought under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Felden v. West, 11 Vet. App. 427, 430 (1998). (citing Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 415 (30th ed., 2003)). 

1. Entitlement to a temporary 100% rating for convalescence based on right ankle surgery, from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a temporary 100 percent rating for convalescence following right ankle surgery. Based on a review of all the evidence of record, the Board finds that a temporary 100 percent rating for convalescence is warranted, from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran was hospitalized for his service-connected right ankle from May 26, 2023, to June 27, 2023. He was discharged but was given doctor prescribed direction to be non-weight bearing on his right ankle until September 27, 2023. The date of September 27, 2023, is the date of the medical provider, Mary Gilmer, M.D., indicating that the Veteran has been instructed to remain non-weight bearing from June 28, 2023, to the date of the letter, September 27, 2023. No additional medical information was provided to indicate that the Veteran remained non-weight bearing beyond this date.

As such, the Board finds regular weight-bearing of his right ankle was prohibited, necessitating the use of a knee scooter or wheelchair from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023. In the Board's view, this meets the definition of "convalescence." Therefore, a temporary total disability rating based on convalescence for that period is warranted.

However, a temporary total evaluation is not warranted beyond September 27, 2023. The Veteran has provided medical evidence from his treating physician stating that the Veteran was non-weight bearing up until September 27, 2023. The next medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran appeared for a February 2024 VA examination related to his claim, wherein the Veteran's restriction on weight bearing was not in effect. To this point, the Veteran's range of motion was tested in weight bearing and non-weight bearing.

In sum, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran required convalescence from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023. There is no evidence of convalescence, based on the prohibition of regular weight-bearing, being required beyond September 27, 2023; therefore, the criteria for a temporary total evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.30, have been met. However, further extension of the convalescent rating beyond September 27, 2023, is not warranted.

2. Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) based on statutory housebound criteria from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, is granted.

The Veteran was previously awarded entitlement to SMC based on the statutory housebound criteria from May 26, 2023, to June 27, 2023. On appeal, the Veteran seeks an additional award of SMC benefits based on his right ankle disability. See VA Form 10182, dated August 14, 2024. 

VA has a "well-established duty" to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 294 (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

As is pertinent to this claim, SMC is payable at the housebound rate if the veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more that are separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involve different anatomical segments or bodily systems.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i)(1).  The Veteran has never alleged, and the evidence does not show, that she has been permanently housebound by reason of her service-connected disabilities, as that phrase is defined in the regulations, during the period on review, and as such 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i)(2) is not for application in this appeal.

In this decision, supra, the Veteran was awarded a temporary 100 percent rating for his service-connected right ankle disability from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023. The ratings in effect for the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities combine to greater than 60 percent. The combined ratings of the Veteran's separate disabilities are sufficient to satisfy the "additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more" prong of an SMC claim, as they involve anatomical segments or bodily systems distinct from the Veteran's right ankle disability. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 293-94, 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i)(1). Accordingly, the requirements for SMC based on the statutory housebound criteria were met from June 28, 2023, to September 27, 2023, on this limited basis, the Veteran's appeal is granted. 

To the extent that the Veteran's appeal attempts to seek additional time periods of eligibility for a temporary 100 percent rating or SMC, the Board notes that the Veteran was previously awarded two separate timeframes of temporary 100 percent disability ratings for his right ankle disability. Additionally, SMC was also previously awarded to the Veteran during a period when he qualified for a temporary 100 percent rating for his right ankle. The Veteran is not entitled to SMC for the period from January 2022 to May 2022, due to the lack of other disabilities separate from his right ankle totalling a 60 percent combined rating.

In the Veteran's VA Form 10182, the Veteran cited a recent surgery that is outside of the evidentiary window, specifically an August 2024 right ankle fusion. This decision is unable to grant entitlement to a disability or SMC for a period of time that is after the rating decision on appeal. Nothing in this decision prevents the Veteran from filing a separate claim for entitlement with the regional office regarding further convalescence or SMC.

Accordingly, the Veteran's appeal seeking entitlement to SMC based on the statutory housebound criteria from June 28, 2023, to September 2023, is granted.
