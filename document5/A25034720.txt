ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical expenses incurred on September 17, 2019, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The non-emergency, non-VA medical services performed on September 17, 2019, were not authorized by VA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

There is no legal basis for payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred on September 17, 2019. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1703, 1725, 1728; 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4000-17.4040. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from November 1966 to November 1969.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Vietnam Service Medal and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2019 decision from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). 

In a February 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran received non-emergent medical services from a non-VA provider on September 17, 2019, for physical therapy.  The Veteran seeks payment or reimbursement for the expenses associated with such care.  In his VA Form 10182, the Veteran alleged that his follow-up physical therapy after his hand and finger surgery was denied.  He advised that without the physical therapy, his hand and finger would not be working, and that he was unaware he needed permission for the non-VA medical treatment. 

As reflected in the December 2020 Explanation of Payment (EOP) from VA, payment from VA was originally denied on the basis that "no authorization number was submitted on the claim and this is a billing requirement for pre-approved care. Please resubmit the claim with the authorization number if approved.  If authorized through a VA third party administrator, please submit claim to them for adjudication." 

The evidence of record reflects the Veteran was treated for a gunshot wound to his hand at a non-VA emergency room on July 24, 2019.  Authorization was extended for treatment and the non-VA claim for July 24, 2019, was approved and paid.  However, the Veteran then sought non-VA physical therapy care on September 17, 2019, and there is no evidence of coordination or authorization in place for the non-VA physical therapy visit.  

38 U.S.C. § 1703 establishes VA's program to furnish hospital care, medical services, and extended care services to covered veterans through non-VA health care providers (the VCCP) and is implemented under 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4000-17.4040. 38 C.F.R. § 17.4010, which establishes the conditions of a Veteran's eligibility for non-VA treatment under § 1703, explicitly states that, if such conditions are met, "the covered veteran may elect to receive authorized non-VA care under § 17.4020." Under 38 C.F.R. § 17.4020(a), "a covered veteran eligible for the Veterans Community Care Program under § 17.4010 may choose to schedule an appointment with a VA health care provider, or have VA authorize the veteran to receive an episode of care for hospital care, medical services, or extended care services from an eligible entity or provider when VA determines such care or services are clinically necessary." 

In the absence of such VA authorization, in order to be entitled to payment or reimbursement of medical expenses incurred at a non-VA facility, certain conditions, including that the treatment was for a medical emergency, must be met. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1725, 1728.  Here, the record reflects that the September 17, 2019, non-VA medical services were not treatment for an emergency, and there is no assertion that they were.  The September 17, 2019, episode of care on appeal was related to physical therapy treatment. 

The record further reflects that the services were not authorized by VA, and the Veteran has not argued otherwise.  To the extent that the Veteran asserts that VA should retroactively authorize payment, or should have authorized payment previously, the Veteran would be contesting a VA decision regarding whether to furnish services through a non-VA provider under 38 U.S.C. § 1703(d) (Conditions under which care is required to be furnished through non-Department providers) and/or (e) (Conditions under which care is authorized to be furnished through non-Department providers).  However, such decisions are statutorily barred from being appealed to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 1703(f) ("The review of any decision under subsection (d) or (e) shall be subject to the Department's clinical appeals process, and such decisions may not be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals").  As the Board has no authority to review any such contentions, they would provide no legal basis for payment. 

As noted above, 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4010 and 17.4020(a) explicitly require VA authorization of non-VA medical services for VA payment of such services, in the absence of a medical emergency.  As there was no VA authorization of the non-emergency, non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran on September 17, 2019, there is no legal basis for VA payment of such expenses.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for payment or reimbursement of the expenses of such services must be denied. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?426, 430 (1994).
