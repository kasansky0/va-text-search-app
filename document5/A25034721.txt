ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was granted service connection for migraine headaches pursuant to an April 2023 Rating Decision. An evaluation of 50 percent disabling was assigned effective February 2, 2023. That date corresponds with the date of receipt of the Veteran's initial claim for service connection.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110, 7105 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.3, 3.151, 3.342, 3.400, 4.17 (2020).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Army from October 2012 to May 2013.

Pursuant to an April 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for migraine headaches with an assigned evaluation of 50 percent disabling, effective February 2, 2023.  

In May 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  Therein, he alleged entitlement to an earlier effective date.

The same month, the rating office (RO) issued a decision which denied the Veteran's claim. 

The Veteran timely appealed the May 2024 rating decision to the Board via VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, dated August 2024, and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.  The Board recognizes that at the time of this decision, it has been less than one year since the date of the rating decision on appeal and that the Veteran has the right to change Board dockets for a full year.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  In the present case, however, the Veteran submitted a motion for advancement along with his August 2024 VA Form 10182, suggesting that he does not desire to change his docket and has asked the Board to decide his claim as quickly as possible.  Therefore, the Board will proceed at this time.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates - Generally

In general, the effective date of an award of compensation and rating based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (2020). When evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred within the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of a claim for increased compensation, the effective date of the award shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if application is received within one year from that date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2) (2014); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) (2020); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

As applicable in this appeal, a "claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

Typically, a claim that has been denied in an unappealed rating decision may not thereafter be reopened and allowed; however, if at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim "VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim." In such cases, the claims are simply reviewed on a de novo basis. Relevant service department records include but are not limited to: (i) "service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease[.]" 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c). For purposes of reconsideration under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c), a relevant service department record is one that addresses a dispositive issue and therefore affects the outcome of the case. See Kisor v. McDonough, 869 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2017).

In such cases where there is a prior final RO or Board denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. See Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332 (1995).

A claimant cannot file a new claim seeking an earlier effective date for an award where the decision that assigned the effective date has already become final. Such would be a "freestanding" effective date claim, and these types of claims are not allowed. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006). The only way to overcome the finality of such a decision is to request revision of the decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE). Id. Each theory of CUE is a separate and distinct matter, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over any theory of CUE in a rating that has not been adjudicated by the RO in the first instance. Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Jarell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 332-33 (2006).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for migraine headaches. As discussed in more detail below, the evidence weighs pervasively against the claim.

The Board notes that the Veteran has not filed request for revision of a prior rating decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE); therefore, the noted theory will not be discussed in this decision. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7111 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105, 3.2600, 20.1400-11 (2020).

Review of the record indicates that the Veteran filed a new claim for service connection for migraine headaches in February 2023.  Thereafter an VA examination was conducted, and favorable findings were indicated.

Pursuant to an April 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for migraine headaches with an assigned evaluation of 50 percent disabling, effective February 2, 2023.  

In May 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application.  Therein, he alleged entitlement to an earlier effective date.

The same month, the RO issued a decision which denied the Veteran's claim.

Also in May 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-10210, lay witness statement.  Therein, he reported submission of an intent to file in March 2022. In July 2022 service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was denied. A supplemental claim was filed for the same condition in August 2022. Seven months later, in February 2023, the Veteran filed a new claim for service connection for migraines. He contends that the March 2022 intent to file was improperly associated with his claim for service connection for GERD. It was further suggested that an intent to file can only apply to a supplemental claim filed greater than 1 year after a notification, otherwise they are invalid.  Assuming proper consideration of the March 30, 2022, intent to file, service connection for the Veteran's migraine headaches would have been established as effective that date.

On review of the record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.

In making all determinations, the Board has fully considered all medical evidence and the lay assertions of record. It also recognizes the Veteran's subjective belief that he is entitled to an earlier effective date. Regrettably, the evidence of record does not support his assertion.

As previously indicated, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the latter. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In such cases where there is a prior final RO or Board denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. See Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332 (1995).

In this case, the Veteran was granted service connection for migraine headaches pursuant to an April 2023 Rating Decision and assigned an effective date of February 2, 2023. That date corresponds with the date of receipt of VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application. The Veteran suggests that an earlier effective date of May 30, 2022, is warranted based upon the date of receipt of a previously submitted intent to file.

However, review of the record indicates that the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for migraine headaches via VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), was received on February 7, 2023.  VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File was received a few days earlier, on February 2, 2023, and it was properly associated with that claim.

While the Board recognizes the Veteran's subjective belief that he is entitled to an earlier effective date, the evidence of record does not support his contentions.

As previously indicated, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. In such cases where there is a prior final RO or Board denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. See Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 246-50 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Flash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 332 (1995).

Give the record as a whole, the Board finds that the earliest effective date permissible is February 2, 2023. Further, the Board rejects the Veteran's argument that a previously submitted intent to file was improperly associated with another claim.  Of note, the March 2022 intent to file was submitted contemporaneously with the Veteran's August 2022 supplemental claim for service connection for GERD.  Therefore, it was no longer active after the claim was adjudicated in a January 2023 Rating decision.  

Conversely, the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for migraine headaches was submitted contemporaneously with a new VA Form 21-0966, Intent to File, received on February 2, 2023.   

Given the above, the Board finds no basis to support the assignment of an effective date earlier than February 2, 2023. Therefore, the Board is bound by applicable laws and regulations regarding the assignment of effective dates for the benefit sought.

 Accordingly, as the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. Thus, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to February 2, 2023, for the grant of service connection migraine headaches must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
