2. After resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus onset in service and continued since service due to his excessive military noise exposure. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from May 1984 to April 1987.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO), an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). In the August 2024 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that new and relevant evidence had been received to warrant readjudication of the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The August 2024 rating decision was issued in response to the Veteran's January 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review, requesting a review of denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus in a December 2023 rating decision. VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in September 2024. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 rating decision, which was subject to review in the August 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus are related to his active duty service. See June 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim; see also September 2022 Correspondence. For the reasons that follow, after resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection is warranted. 

Under the general laws and regulations, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, to establish service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Certain chronic diseases, which are listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), including other organic diseases of the nervous system (hearing loss and tinnitus), may be presumed to have been incurred during service if manifested to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

As an alternative method of establishing incurrence or aggravation and a nexus to service is through a showing of continuity of symptomatology since service. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). Continuity of symptomatology may be established if a claimant can demonstrate that (1) a condition was noted during service; (2) there is a post-service continuity of the same symptomatology; and (3) a nexus between the present disability and the post-service symptomatology. The theory of continuity of symptomatology can be used only in cases involving diseases explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Notably however, "section 3.385 does not preclude service connection for a current hearing disability where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service." Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993). "When audiometric test results at a veteran's separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a "disability" at that time, he or she may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is causally related to service." Id. at 160.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

In this case, the August 2024 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The AOJ also found that the evidence shows an in-service incurrence, to include in-service hazardous noise exposure due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Aviation Ordnanceman. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). As no clear and unmistakable error has been shown by the evidence of record, the Board is bound by these findings. Thus, the current disability and in-service incurrence elements of the claims have been met. 

As to the nexus element, multiple VA opinions were obtained. A February 2021 VA examiner rendered negative nexus opinions as to the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus based on the lack of objective evidence of permanent auditory damage on active duty from conceded noise exposure. The examiner noted that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation. As to the Veteran's tinnitus, the examiner noted that the onset of his condition was reported to be more than 15 years post-separation. A September 2022 VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion as to tinnitus based on the lack of significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability from entrance to separation examination. In December 2023, a VA examiner rendered another negative opinion regarding the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. The examiner also noted the lack of evidence of hearing loss or threshold shifts consistent with acoustic trauma between testing at enlistment and separation. The examiner noted that the Veteran had no pre-service and post-service noise exposure. A July 2024 VA examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion with respect to the Veteran's participation in a toxic risk exposure activity (TERA), to include exposure to asbestos. The examiner noted that medical literature failed to identify a causal relationship between the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus and his participation in a TERA. 

The Board finds the above VA opinions inadequate as they are conclusory and not supported by well-reasoned explanations or specific citation to relevant treatment records. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). When VA obtains an examination or opinion, the examination or opinion must be adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007). The VA opinions placed dispositive weight on the lack of any evidence of hearing loss and tinnitus at time of separation from military service. The examiners also did not adequately address other evidence favorable to the Veteran, including his statements and the circumstances of his service, including that his MOS has a high probability of hazardous noise exposure. Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992); Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 155. In addition, the examiners failed to consider delayed onset of hearing loss and tinnitus. The Director of the VA Compensation and Pension Service observed in Training Letter 10-02 that delayed-onset hearing loss must be considered in the service-connection analysis. As such, the Board assigns the VA opinions no probative value. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) note no hearing issues and that the auditory test results were within normal limits. Although hearing loss was not shown in service, acoustic trauma or military noise exposure may constitute injury of the ears. Moreover, tinnitus is a chronic disease afforded a relaxed standard where there is evidence of acoustic trauma. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). Tinnitus is a disorder uniquely discernable by the senses and the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to diagnose it. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). In addition, continuity of symptoms can act as a substitute for medical nexus evidence. 

In this case, the Veteran has competently and credibly stated that his hearing loss and tinnitus began during service and progressed thereafter. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013; Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d. 1372 (2007). Significantly, the Veteran reported working on aircraft carrier around aircrafts and below decks. See June 2020 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim. The Veteran also reported being exposed to high level noises, including welding and heavy machinery, without hearing protection. See September 2022 Correspondence. The Veteran reported experiencing tinnitus since service, but not knowing about it until 2000s, at which point it had grown more noticeable. The Veteran's STRs also indicate noise exposure with bomb build up job activities and the use of ear plugs. In December 1986, he underwent an explosive driver physical. A September 2023 private treatment record indicates a significant history of noise exposure during the military. It was noted that the Veteran reported that his hearing loss and tinnitus symptoms have been present since the military, but significantly worsened over time. The Veteran's statements regarding in-service noise exposure are consistent with the circumstances of his service and the Board assigns high probative value to his statements. The December 2023 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran had no pre-service and post-service noise exposure. Accordingly, the Board finds that the foregoing evidence of record bolsters the premise that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus began in service and continued since service due to his in-service noise exposure. 

Based on the foregoing, after a review of the evidence of record as a whole, the Board finds that evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus onset in service and continued since service due to his excessive noise exposure in-service. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Thus, entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is granted.
