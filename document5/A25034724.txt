ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbance is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has not been diagnosed with a sleep disability.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for sleep disturbance have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2005 to August 2009. 

In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2021 decision.  In March 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2021 decision and denied the claim on the merits. 

In the March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. §?20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.? 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.? If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.? Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.?  

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.? See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21?Vet. App.?545, 552 (2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).? 

Service Connection

Applicable Laws and Regulations

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 § U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection is also warranted for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Secondary service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is warranted where a non-service-connected disability would have been less severe but for a service-connected disability, either because there is an etiological link (to include worsening of functionality) between the two, or because the service-connected disability resulted in the inability to treat the non-service-connected disability.  Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364-66 (2023) (invalidating the requirement of "proximate cause" and instead holding "but for" causation or aggravation is enough to show entitlement to secondary service connection).

In establishing a current psychiatric disability, a mental disorder diagnosis conforming to the American Psychiatric Association's DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS, FIFTH EDITION (DSM-5) criteria must be shown.  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 404 (2020), aff'd sub nom. Martinez-Bodon v. McDonough, 28 F.4th 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2022) (a valid DSM-5 diagnosis is required to warrant compensation for a psychiatric disability).

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  

The requirement that a current disability exists is satisfied if the Veteran had a disability at the time the claim for VA disability compensation was filed or during the pendency of the claim.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  See also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013) (Board erred in failing to address pre-claim evidence in assessing whether a current disability existed, for purposes of service connection, at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency).

A lay person is competent to report on the onset and reoccurrence of current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge).  The Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate" (meaning nearly equal), with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish all elements of a service connection claim, including the nexus requirement.  See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Sleep Disturbance

The Veteran asserts that service connection for his sleep disturbance is warranted.  See January 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran intended to seek service connection for anxiety and depression as well; those claims, however, were previously denied by the AOJ in a June 2018 rating decision.  Further, the Veteran was informed that if he wanted the AOJ to reconsider the Veteran's claims for anxiety and depression, he would need to file those claims on the proper form.  See January 2021 Correspondence.  Thus, the Veteran's claimed anxiety and depression disorders are not before the Board. 

In denying the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep disturbance, the AOJ identified a favorable finding of the Veteran having a current complaint of trouble sleeping.  See March 2021 rating decision. However, the March 2022 rating decision did not list this finding, and the codesheet indicated that it was removed and did not require a formal overturning due to being improperly formatted. Nevertheless, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; Shedden, supra.

The Board finds that the threshold element of the claim for service connection, i.e., a current disability for sleep disturbance, is not met. In this regard, the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing he is currently diagnosed with a sleeping disability.  Although the available medical treatment records for the period on appeal show complaints of difficulty falling and staying asleep, there is no evidence of treatment or a diagnosis for a sleep disability.  See January 27, 2016, Counseling Record; May 2, 2016, Mental Health Diagnostic Study Note; May 12, 2016, Mental Health Diagnostic Study Note.  

Additionally, although the Veteran asserts his anxiety causes his sleep disturbance, and the medical evidence of record suggests the sleep disturbances are a symptom of his previously denied depression and anxiety, he is currently not service-connected for any mental disabilities.  See May 7, 2019, Addendum; March 2021 Rating Decision Codesheet. The Veteran was provided instructions on how to file a supplemental claim with respect to that claim but to date has not done so. See January 2021 correspondence.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay assertions and his belief that he has a sleep disturbance disability that is etiologically related to service, as a lay person, and under the facts of this case, he is not shown to possess the necessary medical knowledge and expertise to diagnose a medical disability or relate such to service.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376, n. 4.            

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not presented competent evidence showing that he has the sleep disability he claims.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a) ("[A] claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits."); Fagan, 573 F.3d at 1287 (holding that it is the claimant's general evidentiary burden to establish all elements of the claim).  In addition, the evidence does not show a DSM-5 diagnosis of sleep disturbances separate and distinct from his previously claimed psychiatric conditions.  See Martinez-Bodon, supra.  The medical evidence outweighs the lay evidence in this case.

Where the evidence does not support a finding of a current disability upon which to predicate a grant of service connection, there can be no valid claim for that benefit.  See Gilpin v. West, 155 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Brammer, 3 Vet. App. at 225.  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that he should have been afforded an examination for his claimed sleep disorder.  See March 2022 VA Form 20-0996 and March 2023 VA Form 10182.  VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  In this case, the evidence does not show that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service with respect to the Veteran's claimed sleep impairment.  In fact, the Veteran denied frequent trouble sleeping on his May 2009 separation report of medical history.  For a VA examination to be warranted, all the McLendon criteria have to be met, and at least one element is not met.  Therefore, entitlement to a VA examination is not warranted for this service-connection claim. See also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1277-88 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claim for service connection for a sleep disturbance disability is therefore denied.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin,?28?Vet. App.?366, 369-70?(2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
