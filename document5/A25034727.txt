DOCKET NO. 240805-465148
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for service-connected sinusitis is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 27, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Army with active duty from March 1988 to January 2002 and from December 2004 to January 2011.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 16, 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In that rating decision, the AOJ denied a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for sinusitis.

In August 2024, the AOJ received Veteran's VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement.  The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

The evidence shows that on August 5, 2024, the Board received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 for among other issues an increased rating claim for sinusitis.  Thereafter, on August 21, 2024, the AOJ received a VA Form 20-0996 higher-level review request for an increased rating for sinusitis.  On August 26, 2024, the Board sent the Veteran three letters.  In the first letter, the Board notified the Veteran that the issues of TDIU, supraventricular tachycardia, tension headaches, loss of use of creative organ, chronic thoracolumbar spine disability, dermatitis, seborrheic keratosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome in the August 5, 2024 VA Form 10182 were untimely.  The second letter informed the Veteran that the Board had received his VA Form 10182, however, because he already requested a Higher-Level Review or supplemental claim, the Board could not review the case.  Although the letter did not specify the issues, it appears that this was in response to the appeal for service connection for depression and anxiety.  In the third letter, the Board notified the Veteran it had received his VA Form 10182 on August 5, 2024 and the appeal has been placed on the Direct Review docket.  

In November 2024, the AOJ contacted the Veteran to schedule an informal conference for his pending Higher-Lever Review claim.  On December 5, 2024, the Veteran's representative confirmed that the Veteran desired to go forward with his Higher-Level Review request that was submitted on August 21, 2024.  On December 5, 2024, the AOJ sent a letter to the Veteran informing him that his Higher-Level Review request was invalid for the issue of sinusitis as the issue was appealed to the Board first and not withdrawn prior to receipt of the Higher-Level Review request.  

On December 27, 2024, a VA Form 27-0820 form documents that the Veteran visited the Regional Office and requested to have his claims withdrawn from the Board of Veterans' Appeals in Washington, DC.  The Veteran's request was reduced to writing by the VA employee talking to the Veteran in person and it was associated with the claims file.  The VA employee properly identified the Veteran by listing the Veteran's name, identification number, phone number, email address, and mailing address.  There is no other pending VA Form 10182 of record and therefore, it is clear that the Veteran was referencing the August 5, 2024 VA Form 10182 notice of disagreement to the Board.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

As discussed in the procedural history above, it is clear that the Veteran withdrew his appeal to the Board in order to have the AOJ conduct a Higher-Level Review of his increased rating claim for sinusitis.  Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b), a claimant who has filed either a request for Higher-Level Review or an appeal to the Board may not, while that review is pending on appeal, file for administration review of the claim under another option.  However, a claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the request and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issues notice of a decision on an issue.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e).

Therefore, if the Veteran would like his claim to be reviewed under the Higher-Level Review option, then he must resubmit his Higher-Level Review request prior to the notification of the appeal of record (in this case, prior to May 20, 2024, which is the date of the notification letter for the denial of a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for sinusitis).
