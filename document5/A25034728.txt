ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed two separate VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreements on February 25, 2025, appealing the denial of his claims for service connection for a cervical spine and lumbar spine disability.

2. The denial of his claims of service connection for a cervical spine and lumbar spine disability are addressed in a separate Board decision; accordingly, this appeal docket is a duplicate appeal and it is dismissed.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of this specific appeal stream for entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.205.

2. The criteria for dismissal of this specific appeal stream for entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1958 to April 1958.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability and lumbar spine disability most recently addressed in an April 2007 (lumbar spine and cervical spine) rating decision and an October 2022 (lumbar spine) rating decision.  

In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim rating decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

On February 25, 2025, the Veteran submitted duplicate VA Forms 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). He elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability.

In the present matter, two February 25, 2025 Notice of Disagreements were docketed as separate appeals regarding the same issues of service connection for a lumbar spine disability and a cervical spine disability.  They list the exact same issues and appealed the February 2024 rating decision.  The Board has already processed one February 25, 2025, Notice of Disagreement (under Docket Number 202525-512218) and granted service connection for a lumbar spine disability and a cervical spine disability on March 26, 2025.  See March 2025 BVA Decision. Since the evidentiary windows for the claims are the same, the Board finds no prejudice to the Veteran in dismissing this appeal stream (under Docket Number 250225-522012) since the same evidence would have been considered.

In sum, the same issues were mistakenly placed on the Board's direct review docket twice, under separate docket numbers. However, a claimant may not file more than one Notice of Disagreement for an element of a claim. See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); see also Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023) (holding that section 5104C(a) provides more than one administrative review request may be filed within one year of notice of a decision so long as these administrative reviews do not run concurrently). Accordingly, the duplicate appeal under this docket number is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
