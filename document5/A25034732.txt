ORDER

An effective date of September 14, 2014, and no earlier, for the recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran on the basis of permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's child, C., attained the age of 18 on September 14, 2014.

2. The Veteran submitted an April 1999 claim for recognition of C. as a helpless child, and this claim was not adjudicated until the decision on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of September 14, 2014, and no earlier, for the recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran on the basis of permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18 have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 501, 1115, 5101, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.57, 3.151, 3.401, 3.667.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from February 1991 to January 1992. 

In March 2023, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) of an original February 2023 decision that denied entitlement to recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran, for the period prior to May 10, 2021. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the HLR claim in a June 2023 decision. In December 2023, the Veteran appealed the June 2023 HLR rating decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ. Under direct review, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of the date of the original February 2023 decision.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

DEPENDENT BENEFITS

A Veteran who is in receipt of disability compensation of 30 percent or more is entitled to an additional allowance for each dependent. 38 U.S.C. § 1115. Specific rates are provided for a Veteran's spouse and children.

A child is defined as an unmarried person who is (i) under the age of 18 years; (ii) before the age of 18 years became permanently incapable of self-support; or (iii) after attaining the age of 18 years and until completion of education or training (but not after attaining the age of 23 years) is pursuing a course of instruction at an approved educational institution. 38 U.S.C. § 101(4)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.57(a). The allowance is generally discontinued when a dependent child turns 18, or when the child turns 23 if he or she is enrolled in school. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.503, 3.667.

EARLIER EFFECTIVE DATE

In addition, when determining the effective date for an award of additional compensation for dependents, the effective date will be the last of the following dates: (1) the date of claim; (2) the date the dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within a year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the service member's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401(b).

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a), a specific claim must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The Secretary has authority to prescribe the nature and extent of the proof required in order to establish a right to VA benefits. See 38 U.S.C. § 501. Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under laws administered by the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(a)

Entitlement to recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran on the basis of permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18, for the period prior to May 10, 2021.

The Board has reviewed the evidence and finds that entitlement to an effective date of September 14, 2014, and no earlier, is warranted for the recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran on the basis of permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18.

As an initial matter, the threshold criteria of a minimum 30 percent disability rating for basic entitlement to additional payment for dependents has been met since February 1999. 38 U.S.C. § 1115.

In a March 2023 statement, it was asserted that the Veteran first submitted a claim for dependency benefits for her child, C., in April 1999 and that in the subsequent award of dependency benefits and accompanying notice, the Veteran was not notified that she would need to reapply when her child turned 18 years old to seek entitlement to helpless child benefits. The Veteran noted that in a January 2023 rating decision, recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran was granted from September 14, 2014; however, in the February 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that the proper effective date of the benefit award was May 10, 2021. Therefore, an earlier effective date for recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran was requested for the period from September 14, 2014.

A review of the claims file demonstrates that in April 1999 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-686c Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents seeking to add her child, C., as a dependent. She also checked "yes" for the section indicating that her child is permanently helpless for mental or physical reasons, and she stated that her child is fully disabled and receives Social Security Administration (SSA) benefits in the form of full Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. In the accompanying April 1999 notice letter, the Veteran was notified that dependency benefits had been awarded for her child, a VA Form 21-8746 was enclosed regarding information related to dependency benefits, and no additional information was provided regarding entitlement to helpless child benefits. 

In October 2022, the Veteran resubmitted her original April 1999 VA Form 21-686c, and in November 2022, she submitted a new VA Form 21-686c, again asserting that her child, C., is permanently incapable of self-support. Subsequently, in a January 2023 rating decision, the AOJ determined that permanent incapacity for self-support was established for child, C., and that entitlement as a helpless child for VA purposes was granted effective September 14, 2014, the date that C. reached the age of majority. However, in the notice letter that accompanied the January 2023 rating decision, which is the February 2023 decision on appeal, the AOJ determined that the proper effective date of the benefit award was May 10, 2021. This finding was confirmed in the June 2023 HLR rating decision, in which the AOJ stated that although in the original April 1999 dependency claim the Veteran asserted that C. was permanently helpless, the application was received prior to the child's 18th birthday, and that in April 1999 correspondence VA notified the Veteran that dependency benefits for her child would terminate effective September 14, 2014. The AOJ determined that during the pendency of the present claim an Intent to File Form was received on May 10, 2021, and that no provisions provided for an effective date earlier than the date of the receipt of the claim, May 10, 2021.

The Board finds that an entitlement to an effective date of September 14, 2014, and no earlier, is warranted for the addition of C. as a helpless child to the Veteran's award of VA disability compensation. The Board notes that if a claim is left pending without a final adjudication, the claim may be addressed when a subsequent claim is adjudicated by the VA, in which case the effective date for any resulting award of benefits will be the effective date applicable to the earlier claim. Adams v. Shinseki, 568 F.3d 956 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Myers v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 228, 236 (2002); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). The Board finds that the Veteran's April 1999 claim for helpless child benefits, which was submitted prior to C.'s attaining the age of 18, remained pending and unadjudicated until the decision on appeal. Specifically, although the April 1999 decision added C. to the Veteran's award of VA disability compensation as a minor child, it did not adjudicate the helpless child claim, and C. was eventually removed from the Veteran's award of VA disability compensation upon attaining the age of 18 on September 14, 2014. Thus, it is permissible for the effective date of the helpless child claim to be the effective date applicable to the earlier unadjudicated claim, and an effective date of September 14, 2014, the date C. attained the age of 18 and was removed from the Veteran's award of disability compensation benefits, is therefore warranted for the addition of C. as a helpless child to the Veteran's award of VA disability compensation. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of the claim of entitlement to effective date of September 14, 2014, and no earlier, for the recognition of C. as the helpless child of the Veteran on the basis of permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18. Therefore, the appeal in this regard is granted.
