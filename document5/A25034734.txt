DOCKET NO. 241010-486877
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's OSA began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish service connection for OSA are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1975 to April 1997.  

In a February 2024 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for OSA.  In a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ found a duty to assist error had been identified during the higher-level review for OSA.  After completing development, the AOJ most recently denied service connection for OSA on the merits in a September 2024 rating decision.

In October 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, appealing the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA; nevertheless, the "Date of Decision(s)" listed were February 2024 and June 2024.  Further, in his description of the "Specific Issue(s)," the Veteran's "Area of Disagreement" was "service connection, [m]y Doctor days (sic) more likely than not, VA says less likely than not."  See October 2024 VA Form 10182.  As the June 2024 rating decision was an interlocutory decision that was not appealable to the Board, but the appeal stream was completed before the Veteran filed his October 2024 VA Form 10182, and the Board is granting the appeal in full, the Board interprets the Veteran's VA Form 10182 as to the September 2024 rating decision, which was the latest in a sequence of decisions denying service connection for OSA.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).

The allowable time to switch dockets at the Board has not expired.  However, as the Board is granting this appeal full, any further pause would only cause unnecessary delay to the appeals process with no additional benefit to the Veteran.  Accordingly, adjudication is appropriate.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994); Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Service Connection

A veteran is entitled to VA disability compensation if there is a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that a disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

The first two Shedden elements are met and not under dispute.  The Veteran has OSA.  See, e.g., September 2023 Dr. R.D. medical opinion.  The Veteran has testified that his sleep apnea symptoms began in service and continued ever since.  See September 2023 Veteran statement.  Further, his wife and independent witness M.A. who have known him since at least his time on active duty, provided first-hand accounts corroborating that the Veteran's sleep apnea symptoms began in service and continued ever since.  See, e.g., September 2023 S.J. statement; September 2023 M.A. statement.  

Therefore, the fundamental factual dispute in this appeal is whether the Veteran's current OSA began in service.

The Veteran's treating physician opined that in his expert opinion, it is "highly likely that [the Veteran] had sleep apnea during his active-duty years."  See September 2023 Dr. R.D. medical opinion.  According to Dr. R.D., the Veteran exhibited symptoms of disruptive snoring and observed breathing difficulties while asleep during this period.  Further, the Veteran was not aware that his symptoms were abnormal and did not recognize the significance of repetitive pauses in his breathing during sleep.  Importantly, the combination of the Veteran's medical history, symptoms, and the objective findings of his recent sleep studies "supports the likelihood of his experiencing undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea during that time."  Id.

Further, Dr. R.D.'s assessment was grounded in his extensive expertise in sleep medicine, his review of the Veteran's recent sleep study results, the Veteran's medical and sleep history, and Dr. R.D.'s professional experience spanning many years.  Id.  As a result, it was Dr. R.D.'s professional opinion, based on this evaluation, that it is "more likely than not that the Veteran had undiagnosed and untreated sleep apnea during his active-duty years."  Id.

In contrast, VA opinions of record do not directly opine on whether the Veteran's OSA began in service and continued ever since; rather, they find that the Veteran's OSA is not "proximately due to or the result of," or "aggravated beyond its natural progression by" a service-connected disability.  See, e.g., November 2023, December 2023, and July 2024 VA medical opinions.  Further, another opinion finds OSA was not caused by a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  See November 2023 VA medical opinion.

To the extent any VA opinion incidentally finds OSA did not begin in service, the Board notes that such a finding does not address Dr. R.D.'s reasoned opinion, improperly discounts lay testimony from three primary witnesses, and relies primarily on the absence of contemporaneous medical records to render a negative nexus opinion; such an opinion is inadequate for adjudicative purposes.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (2006).

As a result, the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's OSA began in service.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for OSA is warranted.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
