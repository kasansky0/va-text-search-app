REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1996 to December 2000 in the United States Marine Corps and from October 2010 to June 2013 in the United States Army.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision of March 8, 2023.

Pursuant to the Direct Review option that was selected on the Board appeal filed in February 2024, the Board can consider only the evidence before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of the rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202 (b)(1), (c)(1), 20.301.  Appellate argument, as opposed to evidence, will be considered without regard to the latter timeframe.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted for a current disability that results from an injury or disease incurred in, or aggravated by, active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Generally, service connection requires: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

There is a presumption of service connection for certain chronic diseases if the chronic disease is shown as such during service or within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309. When the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported, service connection may be established by a continuity of symptomatology since service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b).

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury.  Any increase in severity of a non-service-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the non-service-connected disease, will be service-connected.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act) took effect on August 10, 2022.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.  Under the PACT Act, VA must provide a disability examination and/or obtain a medical opinion when a veteran submits a claim for compensation and there is evidence of a disability and participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), but the evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a).  A VA memorandum of March 2023 determined that the Veteran did not participate in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

1. Service connection for neck scar.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for neck scar.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  The fact of a qualifying event, injury or disease during service was noted as a favorable finding, as shown by service treatment records (STRs) documenting surgical removal of a tattoo from the back of the neck in January 2000, and by a medical examination report, dated August 15, 2000, that documents a post-operative scar.

On the claim form filed in June 2021, the Veteran maintains that he was told that he would receive an Article 15 punishment and not be allowed home leave at Christmas unless he removed a neck tattoo, which he had had for only a month and which had healed).  He alleged that he then had the tattoo removed, the stitches burst open, and he now has a large, ugly scar on the neck.

The Veteran failed to appear for a VA scar examination that was scheduled for July 13, 2022, and of which the Veteran was adequately notified.  The Veteran has not shown good cause or otherwise explained his failure to report.  Therefore, the claim will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b)(1), the usual effects of medical and surgical treatment in service, having the effect of ameliorating disease or other conditions incurred before enlistment, including postoperative scars, absent or poorly functioning parts or organs, will not be considered service connected unless the disease or injury is otherwise aggravated by service.  In the Veteran's case, the neck tattoo that was removed during service was not a disease or condition incurred before enlistment.  A neck tattoo is not listed on the entrance examination reports of November 1996 and May 2010.  Therefore, the presumption of sound condition upon entry applies.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

The Veteran is competent and credible in reporting that he acquired the tattoo only a month before its removal in January 2000 and that he now has a scar on his neck as a result.  Whether the tattoo removal during service was elective, or the Veteran was ordered to do so, the removal was not done to ameliorate a condition incurred before enlistment, as contemplated by 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b)(1).  Rather, the tattoo was both obtained and removed during active duty service, and the removal caused scarring, as documented in the service treatment records and as competently observed by the Veteran.  With all elements of Shedden having been met, service connection is warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. Service connection for drug and alcohol abuse.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for drug and alcohol abuse.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  It was noted, as a favorable finding, that the Veteran has a current disability as shown by VA treatment records documenting ongoing treatment for substance abuse.

On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges having a drug abuse disorder caused by PTSD or other acquired psychiatric disorder for which service connection is sought.  A VA examination for mental disorders was conducted in December 2022, and unspecified anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder, moderate were diagnosed.  Alcohol use disorder was not diagnosed.

For claims filed after October 31, 1990, an injury or disease incurred during active military, naval, air, or space service shall not be deemed to have been incurred in line of duty if the injury or disease was a result of the abuse of alcohol or drugs by the person on whose service benefits are claimed.  In this context, alcohol abuse means the use of alcoholic beverages over time, or such excessive use at any one time, sufficient to cause disability to, or death of, the user; drug abuse means the use of illegal drugs (including prescription drugs that are illegally or illicitly obtained), the intentional use of prescription or non-prescription drugs for a purpose other than the medically intended use, or the use of substances other than alcohol to enjoy their intoxicating effects.  38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d).

In December 2022 (prior to the March 2023 rating decision on appeal), the Veteran filed an additional service connection claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) that sought service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder and for drug and alcohol abuse.  In response to the December 2022 claim, a rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  A 50-percent rating, effective September 18, 2022, was established.  A subsequent rating decision of September 2024 increased the rating to 70 percent, effective August 1, 2024, and recharacterized the disability as unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder and severe cannabis use disorder.  Because the Veteran has already been granted service connection for his diagnosed substance abuse disorder by the rating decision of February 2023, the claim of entitlement to service connection for drug and alcohol abuse will be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.903(b).

The Board notes that the Board appeal (Notice of Disagreement) filed by the Veteran in February 2024 also sought an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  The issue of an earlier effective date cannot be considered in the present appeal, however, because the grant of service connection grant was made by the rating decision of February 2023 and not the March 2023 rating decision that is the subject of the current appeal.  Only the March 2023 rating decision, and not the February 2023 rating decision, was listed on the appeal form.

3. Service connection for major depression.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for major depression.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  It was noted, as a favorable finding, that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability as shown by VA treatment that documents depressive symptoms.

The scope of the Veteran's claim includes any acquired psychiatric disorder that may reasonably be encompassed by his description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).  A rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  Service connection may be granted for more than one mental health disorder.  See Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges having depression caused by his military service, drug use, marital difficulties, and being alone.  Elsewhere in the record he asserts, in relation to depression, that he became a drug addict and alcoholic while in the Army because people made fun of him, he had no social life, and his wife had been unfaithful.

A review of systems in VA treatment records of October 2016 and January 2017 is negative for depression.  In August 2019, the Veteran denied depression when being treated.  For mental status examinations of November 2019, October 2021, and November 2022, his mood was characterized as euthymic.  VA treatment records of August 2020, May 2021, and others refer to the Veteran's anxiety and depression symptoms as being manageable with current treatment, but there is no diagnosis of depression as a psychiatric disorder in the treatment records.

In December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders.  Unspecified anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder, moderate were diagnosed.  Depressed mood, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, impaired judgment, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work-like setting, were listed as the symptoms applicable to the diagnoses.  He was not separately diagnosed with depression.  In the opinion of the VA examiner, based upon the current examination and a review of the records, the Veteran exhibited symptoms consistent with anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder.  He was found not to have any other symptoms attributable to mental disorders other than the two diagnosed disorders.

In sum, the Veteran's depression has been medically attributed to his diagnosed and service-connected anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder.  The weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran has depression as a diagnosed disorder.  The Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to report his experienced symptoms but not to diagnose a psychiatric disorder.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  In the absence of a current disorder, service connection is not warranted on a direct or secondary basis.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

4. Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  No favorable finding was identified.

On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges having PTSD as caused by personal trauma in service.  In one alleged hazing incident, he was pushed back 10 feet and landed on a couch in a dark room.  In another, he was allegedly forced by drill instructors to show his missing two front teeth for nine weeks, after the teeth fell out during the first week of boot camp.  The Veteran also maintains that he was targeted and put under a "visual microscope" by the command in February 2011.  He further alleges, in relation to PTSD, that his supervisors tricked him for the purpose of writing him up for patterns of misconduct.  He reports having overheard his supervisors talking of their plan to tell him to take a cigarette break and then to write him up for not being at his post.  In addition, according to the Veteran, a master sergeant wrote a report stating that the Veteran had told the master sergeant of the Veteran's adultery with a named person.  The Veteran believes that, because of these incidents, he became unable to trust anyone in the Marines or Army, feels always tricked and lied to, trusts no one, abuses drugs and alcohol, and is depressed.

PTSD screens of November 2014 and November 2019 were negative.  In December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders other than PTSD and eating disorders.  Unspecified anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder, moderate, were diagnosed.  The Veteran failed to appear for VA examinations that were scheduled for July 13, 2022, to evaluate him for PTSD.  He has not offered an explanation, or shown good cause, for his failure to report.  Therefore, the claim will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

A rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  Service connection may be granted for more than one mental health disorder (PTSD or otherwise), but the disorders cannot be separately rated unless they result in different manifestations.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14; see also Amberman v. Shinseki, 570 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Establishing service connection for PTSD generally requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in conformance with established criteria; (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between a veteran's present symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(f), 4.125; see also Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  A diagnosis of PTSD for compensation purposes must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

The Veteran has not been diagnosed with PTSD pursuant to the DSM-5.  VA treatment records document negative PTSD screenings.  As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to report his experienced symptoms but not competent to diagnose PTSD.  See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Service connection requires a current disorder.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  In the absence of a current diagnosis of PTSD, service connection for PTSD is not warranted.

5. Service connection for dizziness.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for dizziness.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  It was noted, as a favorable finding, that a qualifying event, injury or disease had its onset during service as shown by the Veteran's April 2000 report of symptoms of dizziness associated with acute viral syndrome and dehydration.

The Veteran alleges on the claim form filed in March 2022 that he has dizziness that is caused or aggravated by the drug abuse for which service connection is also sought.  A rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  In December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders.  Unspecified anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder, moderate were diagnosed.  Neither dizziness nor spatial disorientation was cited as a symptom of the diagnosed disorders.

For a report of medical history in August 1999, the Veteran answered "yes" as to any past or current fainting or dizziness.  The Veteran denied lightheadedness in a service treatment record of February 2011.  Dizziness, vertigo, and lightheadedness were denied in December 2011, when the Veteran received treatment for headache and a cough.  He also reported no lightheadedness and had normal balance in an STR of May 2013.  Dizziness is not diagnosed in the service treatment records as a disorder or recurring symptom.

The Veteran failed to appear for VA examinations that were scheduled for July 13, 2022, in order to evaluate him for dizziness and for drug and alcohol abuse. He has not offered an explanation, or shown good cause, for his failure to report.  Therefore, the claim will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.   38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

There is no medical diagnosis of a dizziness disorder.  The Veteran is competent to report his dizziness but not to diagnose a dizziness disorder.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  A diagnosis is not required to meet the current disability requirement of service connection; pain and other symptoms that impair earning capacity can constitute a disability.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  However, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Veteran's experienced dizziness could be found to impair his earning capacity, the Veteran is not competent to relate his experienced dizziness to a disease, injury, or event of service or to a service-connected disability, and no competent opinion of record makes such an association.  See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (the competence of lay testimony depends on the nature of the condition).

To the extent that he alleges recurrent dizziness from service to the present, the Board finds him not to be credible due to inconsistency with other evidence.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  Specifically, he reported no dizziness when examined at separation in February 2013, although he cited other injury and impairment.  While the Board may not consider the absence of evidence as substantive, negative evidence, the absence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact, if it would ordinarily be recorded.  See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 223-24 (2011).  VA treatment records of October 2016 and January 2017 made negative findings for vertigo.  The Veteran also denied lightheadedness and dizziness in a VA treatment record of August 2019 and denied dizziness in September 2021.  The clear weight of the evidence is against finding that the dizziness currently experienced by the Veteran was incurred during service or is caused or aggravated by a service- connected disability.  Accordingly, service connection is not warranted.

6. Service connection for fatigue.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for fatigue.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claim was again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  It was noted, as a favorable finding, that a qualifying event, injury or disease had its onset during service as shown by the Veteran's October 2011 report of symptoms of fatigue associated with acute viral syndrome.

A service treatment record of October 2011 notes stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, chills, and chest congestion.   The diagnosis was viral syndrome.  An STR of February 2013 notes, in a review of systems, that the Veteran did not feel tired or fatigued.  Nor was fatigue found when the Veteran was examined for separation in February 2013.  He did not cite fatigue in his report of medical history at separation.

In December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders.  Unspecified anxiety disorder and opioid use disorder, moderate were diagnosed.  Chronic sleep impairment and disturbances of motivation and mood were among the symptoms associated with the diagnoses.  Fatigue was not diagnosed as a disorder.  A rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder

The Veteran failed to appear for VA examinations that was scheduled for July 13, 2022, to evaluate him for fatigue.  He has not offered an explanation, or shown good cause, for his failure to report.  Therefore, the claim will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

There is no medical diagnosis of a fatigue disorder.  The Veteran is competent to report his experienced fatigue but not to diagnose a fatigue disorder.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges having fatigue that is worsened because of military service.  He maintains that he is always tired and worn out from a guilty feeling about his "worthless" life.

A diagnosis is not necessarily required to meet the current disability requirement of service connection; pain alone can constitute disability if it causes impairment in earning capacity.  See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  However, even assuming for the sake of argument that the Veteran's experienced fatigue could be found to impair his earning capacity, the Veteran is not competent to relate his experienced fatigue to a disease, injury, or event of service or to a service-connected disability, and no competent opinion of record makes such an association.  See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

To the extent that he alleges recurrent fatigue symptoms from service to the present, the Board finds him not to be credible due to inconsistency with other evidence. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  Specifically, the Veteran reported no fatigue at separation in February 2013, while citing other injury or impairment.  He also denied fatigue in a VA treatment record of August 2019.  The clear weight of the evidence is against finding that the fatigue currently experienced by the Veteran was incurred during service or is caused or aggravated by a service- connected disability.  Accordingly, service connection is not warranted.

7. Service connection for hepatitis B.

8. Service connection for hepatitis C.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for hepatitis B and for hepatitis C.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claims were again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  It was noted, as a favorable finding, that VA treatment records show a diagnosis of hepatitis C.  No favorable finding was identified with respect to hepatitis B.

On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges having hepatitis B and that is caused by an in-service injury, exposure, or event, or is caused or aggravated by a disorder for which service connection is also sought, namely PTSD, intravenous drug use, or hepatitis C.  He maintains having hepatitis C caused by his use of dirty needles to inject cocaine and crack.  Neither hepatitis B nor hepatitis C are noted in the service treatment records or in the separation examination reports of August 2000 and February 2013.

A VA treatment record of October 2016 notes recent transaminitis/hepatitis with a liver biopsy having been performed in July 2016.  The biopsy showed acute hepatitis with microgranuloma with Kupffer cell aggregates, neg adenovirus/HSVA/CMV/fungi/mycobacteria/ebv., possible drug-induced liver injury, less likely infectious or autoimmune hepatitis.  In October 2016, the assessment was status post liver biopsy negative micro studies, with possible either autoimmune or drug-induced hepatitis.  The Veteran's history of intravenous drug use was noted.  Hepatitis C was antibody (ab) pos/viral load (VL) negative, and the Veteran was found to be immune for hepatitis A and B.  A VA treatment record of June 2019 documents a laboratory result of nonreactive for hepatitis B core antibody.  Although liver functions tests had been elevated in August, they were currently normal.  A VA treatment record of June 2021 lists viral hepatitis C as having been diagnosed in September 2016.

A VA treatment record of October 2013 lists, as an active problem under the heading of Medical History, chronic hepatitis C viral load non- detectable.  The Veteran was diagnosed with hepatitis C in October 2016, and the AOJ made the favorable finding of hepatitis C as a current disorder.  A VA treatment record of December 2022 lists hepatitis C and hepatitis C antibody test positive as active problems. 

The Veteran failed to appear for a VA examination in relation to hepatitis B and C that was scheduled for July 13, 2022.  He had not offered an explanation, or shown good cause, for his failure to report to this examination of which he was adequately notified.  Therefore, the claim will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

Hepatitis C is not diagnosed in the service treatment records or noted on the separation examination report of February 2013.  The service treatment records diagnose or note surgical removal of a tattoo (January 2000), dermatitis of eyelid infective herpes simplex (February 2011), viral syndrome (October 2011), a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (January 2012), genital warts (January 2012), and condyloma acuminatum (February 2013).  Hallucinogenic and substance abuse are also noted in the service treatment records, and a rating decision of February 2023 granted service connection for unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder.  A 50-percent rating, effective September 18, 2022, was established.  A subsequent rating decision of September 2024 increased the rating to 70 percent, effective August 1, 2024, and recharacterized the disability as unspecified anxiety disorder with opioid use disorder and severe cannabis use disorder.

The Veteran is competent to report his experienced symptoms but not to diagnose hepatitis or to relate hepatitis to a disease, injury, or service, or to determine that a service-connected disability causes or aggravates hepatitis.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  There is no competent opinion that relates hepatitic C as a current disorder to a disease, injury, or exposure of the Veteran's service or to a service-connected disability.  VA treatment records indicate that the positive finding of hepatitis C reflects an autoimmune disease or results from the Veteran's intravenous drug use.  That estimation as to possible causes of the Veteran's hepatitis C does not provide the degree of certainty required for a medical nexus, even under the deferential, equipoise standard of 38 C.F.R. §3.102.  See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999).  In other words, the clinician's statement that the Veteran's intravenous drug use may have caused his hepatitis C is not equivalent to asserting that intravenous drug use is at least as likely as not the cause.  See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1995) (qualitative language such as "may or may not be" can be considered when evaluating the probative value of an opinion).

The weight of the evidence, which is not in approximate balance, is also against finding that the Veteran has hepatitis B or a liver disorder.  The Veteran has been found to be immune from hepatitis B.  Accordingly, the first element of Shedden is not met with respect to the hepatitis B claim.  To the extent that the Veteran asserts that he has hepatitis B, he is competent to report experienced symptoms but not to diagnose hepatitis.  The competent and credible findings of VA treatment are highly probative as to a current disorder.  The VA clinicians are trained to diagnosis hepatitis and liver dysfunction, and the lack of a hepatitis B diagnosis precludes service connection.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 132 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

9. Service connection for degenerative arthritis.

10. Service connection for left ankle arthritis.

11. Service connection for left foot condition.

A rating decision of August 2022 denied service connection for degenerative arthritis, left ankle arthritis, and left foot condition.  In March 2023, the Veteran requested higher-level review, and the claims were again denied by a rating decision of March 2023.  The relevant favorable findings made in the rating decision were that VA treatment records show a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis affecting the left ankle and left foot, and that a service treatment record of January 1997 notes a blister on the left heel.

In December 2022 and January 2023 (prior to the higher-level review of March 2023), the Veteran filed service connection claims (VA Form 21-526EZ) that sought service connection for arthritis and for degenerative arthritis.  On these forms, he referred to his joints generally and to left ankle arthritis.  In correspondence of January 2023, he stated that his arthritis affects his hips, ankles, wrists, knees, shoulders, elbows, fingers, toes, jaw, and bite.  On March 3, 2023, prior to the rating decision of March 8th, 2023, from which the current appeal is taken, the Veteran filed a claim seeking service connection for rheumatoid arthritis, which he alleged to be caused by in-service training.  In response to the March 2023 claim, a rating decision of March 2023 denied service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  The Board appeal filed in February 2024 did not cite the March 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for rheumatoid arthritis.  A rating decision of May 2014 denied service connection for right hip arthritis and for a neck condition.  Service connection has been granted for disabilities of the back, feet, and shoulders.

On the claim form filed in March 2022, the Veteran alleges in-service injury to his ankle from training hikes in the Marines and from a twisted ankle while in the Army.  A service treatment record of January 1997 notes a blister on the left heel.  In addition, an STR of September 2000 documents removal of an ingrown portion of the nail of the left great toe.

Current disorders of the left ankle and left foot have been established as favorable findings of the AOJ.  A VA treatment record of October 2013 includes osteoarthritis in a list of active problems.  No joint is specified.  A VA treatment record of June 2021 lists osteoarthrosis, unspecified whether generalized or localized, involving unspecified site.  A VA treatment record of December 2022 lists osteoarthritis as an active problem.

The Veteran failed to appear for VA examinations relating to joint pains ankle/degenerative arthritis, ankles, and feet that were scheduled for July 13, 2022.  He has not offered an explanation, or shown good cause, for his failure to report to these examinations of which he was adequately notified.  Therefore, the claims will be adjudicated upon the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

The Veteran is competent to report his experienced symptoms during and following service, but not to diagnose a foot disorder or arthritis, or to relate a general medical finding of osteoarthritis to a particular joint, including the ankles or feet.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Nor is the Veteran competent to relate his currently experienced symptoms of the ankle and foot to a disease, injury, or event of service or to a service-connected disability.  See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

Upon the current record, the clear weight of the evidence is against finding that the third element of Shedden, a nexus between current disability and a disease or injury of service, is met as to the three claims or that a nexus may be presumed for arthritis as a listed chronic disease.  No competent opinion of record relates a current disorder of the left foot or left ankle to a disease or injury of service.  Moreover, a nexus may not be presumed based on arthritis as a listed chronic disease, because arthritis of the left foot or left ankle was not diagnosed during service or within one year of service separation.

Although osteoarthritis was noted as an active problem in October 2013, which was within one year of service separation in June 2013, the left foot or left ankle was not specified.  Had the Veteran reported to the VA examination for joint pains and degenerative arthritis in June 2021, it would have been possible to obtain a medical nexus opinion based, in part, upon the examiner's expert review of the medical history.  The Board is not competent to relate the general finding of osteoarthritis in October 2013 to any particular joint.  See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 171, 175 (1991).

To the extent that the Veteran alleges recurrent symptoms of the left foot or left ankle from service to the present, the Board finds him not to be credible due to inconsistency with other evidence. See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).  Specifically, when examined in February 2011 in relation to complaints of back pain and elbow contracture, no weakness of either ankle was observed.  For the separation examination of September 2000 (first service period), the Veteran reported having occasional heel pain of the left foot when wearing boots.  For the separation examination report of February 2013, however, the Veteran was found to have normal feet and lower extremities, and a normal musculoskeletal system with normal movement of all extremities.  He reported no problem of the left foot or left ankle and denied any past or current swollen or painful joints, arthritis, foot trouble, or impaired use of the legs or feet.
