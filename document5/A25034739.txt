Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 8, 2020, for the assigned separate 40 percent rating for service-connected right knee limitation of extension is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) from September 7, 2018, to July 8, 2020, to include for the purpose of providing for an earlier effective date of September 7, 2018, for the award of entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (hereinafter "DEA"), is granted.

Entitlement to a TDIU from July 8, 2020, onward, for the purpose of special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), is dismissed as moot.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of September 7, 2018, for the award of entitlement to DEA is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent rating for service-connected left knee instability from August 13, 2001, the date of service connection for his service-connected left knee disability, through to present; therefore, he cannot receive an earlier effective date for his assigned 10 percent rating for such.

2. The January 2006 rating decision, which, in part, assigned an increased 10 percent rating for service-connected right knee laxity of patella and the February 2015 rating decision, which, in part, continued the assigned ratings for service-connected left and right knee laxity of patella, arthritis of the right knee, and left knee strain, became final. 

3. The date of receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ-September 7, 2018-per which the Veteran sought, in part, increased ratings as to his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities, represents the "date of receipt of claim" as to the effective date issues on appeal; therefore, the Veteran has been in receipt of 10 percent ratings for service-connected left and right knee instability for more than 15 years prior to the date of receipt of the claim.

4. The Veteran's service-connected left knee limitation of extension did not approximate extension limited to 30 degrees or worse, to include with consideration of the impact of pain, repeated use, and repeated use over time, and without consideration of the ameliorative effects of medication, prior to July 8, 2020.

5. The Veteran's service-connected right knee limitation of extension did not approximate extension limited to 30 degrees or worse, to include with consideration of the impact of pain, repeated use, and repeated use over time, and without consideration of the ameliorative effects of medication, prior to July 8, 2020.

6. The evidence as to unemployability is in relative equipoise; therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his service-connected disabilities, in combination, prevented him from obtaining substantially gainful employment prior to July 8, 2020. 

7. Effective June 11, 2019, the Veteran is in receipt of special monthly compensation based on need of regular aid and attendance, which is a greater monetary benefit than an award of entitlement to a TDIU, to include for the purpose of special monthly compensation at the housebound rate.

8. The Veteran was honorably discharged from the United States Air Force and, based on the above grant of entitlement to a TDIU from September 17, 2018, to July 8, 2020, had a permanent total service-connected disability, effective September 7, 2018.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1975 to December 1979.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a December 2022 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The December 2022 rating decision was issued in response to the Veteran's September 2022 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, which he submitted as to both a September 2021 rating decision adjudicating the left and right knee disability claims and eligibility to DEA and a December 2021 rating decision finding that entitlement to a TDIU was moot. 

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the December 2022 rating decision to the Board. He elected the Direct review option; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2021 rating decision as to the bilateral knee and DEA claims and December 2021 rating decision as to the TDIU claim. The Board can, however, consider the legal impact of subsequent decisions on the appealed issues and has done so below.

As to any evidence associated with the claims file after the September 2021 rating decision as to the bilateral knee and DEA claims and after the December 2021 rating decision as to the TDIU claim, the Board cannot consider such. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301; see also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023). To the extent that this evidence may relate to the claim decided below, the Veteran is advised to submit a Supplemental Claim. Instructions for doing so are attached to this decision.

As to all issues on appeal, the Board notes that the relevant consideration period begins with receipt of a September 7, 2018, VA Form 21-526EZ, in which the Veteran sought higher ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities. The Veteran did not perfect an appeal of any rating decision as to the ratings assigned for his bilateral knee disabilities prior to that claim, so the relevant consideration period does not precede the date of receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ. Following the October 2018 rating decision, which adjudicated that claim, the Veteran timely disagreed with that rating decision, which led to issuance of the December 2019 Statements of the Case (SOCs), and he then opted into the modernized review system, continuously pursuing higher ratings for his bilateral knee disabilities through to the December 2022 rating decision on appeal pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). However, the continuous pursuit provisions under § 3.2500(c) only apply to rating decisions issued under the modernized review system (also known as the Appeals Modernization Act or "AMA") (i.e., rating decisions issued beginning on February 19, 2019). Nonetheless, in adjudicating the claims on appeal, the Board also considers evidence as to the severity of his service-connected disabilities from the year prior to receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The relevant consideration period as to the bilateral knee disabilities ends on September 23, 2021-the date of issuance of the September 2021 rating decision-and the relevant consideration period as to entitlement to a TDIU ends on December 1, 2021-the date of issuance of the December 2021 rating decision. 

Earlier Effective Dates: Bilateral Knees

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), the effective date of an increase in a veteran's disability compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." Subsection 5110(b)(2) provides an exception to this general rule: "The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date."

Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of an increased rating earlier effective date case:

(1) If an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1));

(2) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)); or

(3) If an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982-84 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see also Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).

By way of background, the Veteran is service-connected for left and right knee disabilities, including left and right laxity of patella (later recategorized to left and right knee instability), beginning on August 13, 2001. Since filing his informal service connection claim from August 2001, he repeatedly sought increased ratings for his service-connected bilateral knee disabilities. Following receipt of a February 2014 VA Form 21-526EZ, in which he sought increased ratings as to his knee disabilities, in a February 2015 rating decision, the RO continued his existing ratings for his knee disabilities pending reexamination as then-recent evidence showed improvement. After obtaining a December 2016 VA examination again showing improvement in the severity of his knee disabilities, the RO proposed to decrease the 10 percent ratings assigned for his left and right knee laxity of patella in a February 2017 rating decision. The RO later implemented its proposed reductions as to the left and right knee laxity of patella ratings, effective November 1, 2018, in an August 2018 rating decision. 

The Veteran did not express disagreement with the August 2018 rating decision, but, in September 2018, he sought increased ratings for his left and right knee instability via VA Form 21-526EZ. The RO subsequently continued both his non-compensable left and right knee instability ratings and his assigned 10 percent left and right knee limitation of flexion ratings in an October 2018 rating decision. Per two separate filings, he timely disagreed with the assigned ratings for his left and right knee instability and limitation of flexion. See November 2018 & October 2019 VA Forms 21-0958. The RO prepared responsive SOCs in December 2019, and, instead of perfecting a legacy appeal by filing VA Form 9, he opted into the AMA and requested higher-level review of, in part, the ratings assigned for his left and right knee instability and limitation of flexion as adjudicated in the December 2019 SOCs. See February 2020 VA Form 20-0996. 

Following submission of his February 2020 VA Form 20-0996, the Veteran continuously pursued entitlement to higher ratings for his left and right knee instability and limitation of flexion through to the instant appeal. See June 2020 Rating Decision; June 2021 VA Form 20-0995; September 2021 Rating Decision; September 2022 VA Form 20-0996; December 2022 Rating Decision; December 2023 VA Form 10182. In a September 2021 rating decision, the RO assigned separate 40 percent ratings for left and right knee limitation of extension, effective June 17, 2021, and increased 10 percent ratings for left and right knee instability, also effective June 17, 2021. In the December 2022 rating decision on appeal, the RO awarded an earlier effective date of July 8, 2020, for the assigned separate 40 percent ratings for left and right knee limitation of extension and awarded an earlier effective date of November 1, 2018-the effective date of the prior reduction-for the assigned 10 percent ratings for left and right knee instability. 

In light of the above-outlined procedural history, and for the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the relevant consideration period begins with receipt of the Veteran's September 2018 increased rating claim as to his bilateral knee disabilities, as that claim represents the first increased rating claim as to the bilateral knee disabilities filed after issuance of the February 2015 rating decision, which represents the last prior final adjudication of the ratings assigned for the bilateral knee disabilities. See September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ; see also February 2014 VA Form 21-526EZ; February 2015 Rating Decision. 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran was first assigned an increased 10 percent rating for service-connected right knee laxity of patella, effective March 26, 2003, in a January 2006 rating decision, and if that rating decision did not become final, the consideration period for the instant earlier effective date claim as to this disability could, potentially, predate issuance of that rating decision. However, the Board finds that the January 2006 rating decision became final as the Veteran withdrew his then-pending August 2005 Notice of Disagreement that prompted issuance of the January 2006 rating decision and no evidence, let alone new and material evidence as to the severity of this disability, was received within the one-year period following such. See January 2006 Rating Decision (RO noting that the decision was issued following receipt of an August 2005 Notice of Disagreement); January 2006 Statement in Support of Claim (Veteran expressing satisfaction with the latest decision and wishing to "drop all issues on appeal at this time"); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a) (defining "new and material evidence"). Consequently, the claim that gave rise to the January 2006 rating decision did not remain pending, and the relevant consideration period for the earlier effective date issues as to the bilateral knee disabilities on appeal does not extend to the January 2006 rating decision.

Separately, the Board recognizes that, as to the February 2015 rating decision, within one-year after issuance thereof, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to a TDIU based, in part, on his service-connected knee disabilities. See May 2015 VA Form 21-8940 (reporting inability to stand for long because of his knees). Although this evidence was received within the appeal period of the February 2015 rating decision and pertained, in part, to the severity of his knee disabilities, because it is redundant of evidence already considered by the RO in the February 2015 rating decision (i.e., a January 2015 VA knee examination documenting the Veteran's report of difficulty standing for long periods of time due to his knees), it does not represent new and material evidence such that the February 2015 rating decision did not become final. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a)

Further, the Board recognizes that, two months after issuance of the February 2015 decision, additional Detroit VAMC treatment records dated between March 2013 and April 2015 were received. If VA receives new evidence within the appeal period of an RO decision, it must be considered according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). If such consideration is not performed, the underlying claim does not become final but instead remains pending. Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014); see also Turner v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 207 (2018) (VA treatment records generated within the one-year appeal period following a rating decision may satisfy the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) when VA adjudicators at VBA have knowledge of the existence of those VA treatment records within the one-year appeal period); see also Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (2020) (a VA adjudicator does not need actual knowledge of VA-generated medical records created within one year following a VA decision to establish constructive receipt for the purposes of applying 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) because VA has constructive knowledge of these records). Here, however, these VA treatment records are not new and material such that the February 2015 rating decision did not become final, as the records either did not relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate a claim for higher ratings as to the service-connected bilateral knee disabilities (i.e., moderate recurrent subluxation or lateral instability, flexion limited to 30 degrees or worse, extension limited to 15 degrees or worse, and/or x-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations) or were redundant of evidence already considered by the RO as to unestablished facts. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a). Consequently, the claim that gave rise to the February 2015 rating decision did not remain pending, and the relevant consideration period for the earlier effective date issues as to the bilateral knee disabilities on appeal does not extend to the February 2015 rating decision. 

Additionally, the Board also recognizes that, less than a month prior to receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, the RO issued the August 2018 rating decision implementing, in part, reductions of left and right knee laxity of patella ratings proposed in the February 2017 rating decision, but all ratings decreased therein have since been indirectly reinstated by later rating decisions. See December 2022 Rating Decision (again assigning 10 percent ratings for service-connected left and right knee laxity of patella, effective November 1, 2018-the effective date of the prior reductions from 10 percent to 0 percent for service-connected left and right knee laxity of patella). Further, the February 2017 rating decision was issued in response to routine December 2016 VA examinations ordered by the RO rather than related to any increased rating claim filed by the Veteran as to the issues addressed therein, and the August 2018 rating decision, as to left and right knee laxity of patella, merely implemented the reductions proposed in the February 2017 rating decision. The Board notes that the propriety of a rating reduction is a separate issue from a claim for an increased rating. See Dofflemeyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 279-80 (1992); Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991). Consequently, the finality of the August 2018 rating decision, which solely implemented proposed rating reductions, has no bearing in ascertaining the relevant consideration period as to earlier effective date issues below.  

Thus, again, the relevant consideration period as to earlier effective date issues on appeal begins with receipt of the Veteran's September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 13, 2001, for the assigned 10 percent rating for service-connected left knee instability is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than March 26, 2003, for the assigned 10 percent rating for service-connected right knee instability is denied.

The Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for his assigned 10 percent ratings for service-connected left and right knee instability, previously referred to as left and right knee laxity of patella, respectively. Prior to the RO's assignment of 10 percent ratings for these disabilities, retroactive to November 1, 2018, his representative generally contended that he continuously pursued earlier effective dates for his bilateral knee disabilities via the private examinations he submitted in 2020. See December 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet. Since the RO's assignment of 10 percent ratings for these disabilities such that he is now in receipt of a 10 percent rating for left knee instability since August 13, 2001, and a 10 percent rating for right knee instability since March 26, 2003, neither he nor his representative have provided any argument as to why they believe even earlier effective dates are warranted. See, e.g., December 2023 VA Form 10182. 

In light of the procedural background detailed above, although the ratings assigned for his service-connected left and right knee instability were decreased to non-compensable, effective November 1, 2018, in an August 2018 rating decision, the Veteran is nonetheless now in receipt of a 10 percent rating for his left knee instability from August 13, 2001 to present and a 10 percent rating for his right knee instability from March 26, 2003 to present. Further, as initially discussed, the relevant consideration period as to all issues on appeal begins on September 7, 2018. Therefore, the Veteran is in receipt of an effective date for his assigned 10 percent ratings for left and right knee instability not only throughout the relevant consideration period as to this appeal but also for more than 15 years prior to the relevant consideration period. Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o), the effective date of an increased rating may be assigned from (1) the date an increase is shown to have occurred if occurring after the claim is filed; (2) the date an increase is shown to have occurred if preceding the claim by a year or less; (3) or the date of the claim if the increase is shown to have preceded the claim by more than a year. Here, regardless of whether and/or when the Veteran's service-connected right and left knee laxity of patella may have increased in severity so as to approximate 10 percent ratings, because the date of claim as to the instant appeal is the date of receipt of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ and because the effective dates for the assigned 10 percent ratings for these disabilities precedes the date of receipt of his claim by more than 15 years, he simply cannot receive an earlier effective date for his assigned 10 percent rating than the effective date he is already assigned for such. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 8, 2020, for the separate 40 percent rating for service-connected left knee limitation of extension is denied.

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 8, 2020, for the separate 40 percent rating for service-connected right knee limitation of extension is denied. 

The Veteran seeks effective dates earlier than July 8, 2020, for his separate 40 percent ratings for service-connected left and right knee limitation of extension. Prior to the RO's award of an earlier effective date of July 8, 2020, for the increased 40 percent ratings for these disabilities, his representative generally contended that he continuously pursued earlier effective dates for his bilateral knee disabilities via the private examinations he submitted in 2020. See December 2022 HLR Informal Conference Worksheet. Since the RO's award of an earlier effective date of July 8, 2020, for the increased 40 percent ratings for these disabilities, neither he nor his representative have provided any argument as to why they believe even earlier effective dates are warranted. See, e.g., December 2023 VA Form 10182. 

As detailed above, the relevant period for consideration of the Veteran's earlier effective date claims extends to September 7, 2018, the date of receipt of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ. Consequently, the question as to the limitation of extension effective date issues on appeal is whether the Veteran's service-connected left and/or right knee disabilities approximated a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5010-5261 in the year prior to September 7, 2018, or at any point between September 7, 2018, and July 8, 2020, or only as of July 8, 2020. 

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended, effective February 7, 2021. 85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020). These amendments revised select diagnostic codes "to ensure that this portion of the rating schedule uses current medical terminology and provides detailed and updated criteria for the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities." Id. If a law or regulation changes during the course of a claim or an appeal, the version more favorable to the Veteran will apply, to the extent permitted by any stated effective date in the amendment in question. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g). As the relevant consideration period for both left and right knee limitation of extension ends prior to the effective date of the amendments, the Board considers the Veteran's claims under only the former rating criteria. 

The Veteran's service-connected left and right knee limitation of extension are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5010-5261. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires the use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the rating assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.

Under the former Diagnostic Code 5010, traumatic arthritis substantiated by x-ray findings is to be rated as degenerative arthritis under Diagnostic Code 5003. 

Diagnostic Code 5003 directs that a rating shall be awarded on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved. If noncompensable limitation of motion is demonstrated, a 10 percent rating is assigned for x-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joints groups, and a 20 percent rating is assigned for x-ray evidence of involvement of two or more major joints or two or more minor joints groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003. The term "incapacitating exacerbations" is not defined; however, for comparison purposes, the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome based on incapacitating episodes defines an "incapacitating episode" as a period of acute signs and symptoms that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243 Note (1).

Under Diagnostic Code 5261, which remains unchanged, a 40 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 30 degrees or worse. 

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. Additionally, § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.

The Veteran's examinations, treatment records, and lay statements provide insight as to the severity of his limitation of extension as to both of his knees shortly prior to receipt of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ through to July 8, 2020, the effective date of his increased 40 percent ratings.

At a June 2018 VA knee examination, the Veteran reported experiencing increased joint pain since falling in April 2016, with pain on his left side worse than on his right. He further reported that his pain would come and go, climbing stairs increased his pain, and he could not run any more, but he denied experiencing flare-ups. Initial range of motion (ROM) testing revealed extension to 0 degrees bilaterally with pain in passive motion and non-weight-bearing but not with weight-bearing. Repetitive use testing revealed no additional loss of function or ROM after three repetitions, and the examiner determined that neither pain, weakness, fatigability, nor incoordination significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over a period of time. The examiner further determined that he experienced bilateral pain as an additional contributing factor of disability. 

At an October 2018 VA knee examination, the Veteran reported experiencing increased severity of his knee disabilities since falling in 2016, with his right knee worse than his left but constant pain in both knees. He denied experiencing flare-ups. Initial ROM testing revealed extension to 0 degrees in active and passive motion bilaterally with pain in passive and active motion and with weight-bearing but not with non-weight-bearing. Repetitive use testing revealed no additional loss of function or ROM after three repetitions, and the examiner was unable to determine, without resort to mere speculation, whether pain, weakness, fatigability, and/or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over a period of time.

In October 2018 and July 2019, the Veteran reported experiencing, in part, bilateral knee pain and stiffness, and a provider observed his ROM was "0-90" bilaterally, indicating that he retained extension to 0 degrees bilaterally. See October 2018 Orthopedic Consult Response & July 2019 Orthopedic Clinic Note. 

Per a July 2020 private knee examination report, initial ROM testing revealed extension to 40 degrees bilaterally with pain in active and passive motion and with weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing. Dr. N.Z. determined that pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability during flare-ups or with repeated use over time, which resulted in decreased ROM bilaterally, but she did not state such in terms of specific ROM measurements. The report includes no indication or suggestion that the severity of limitation of extension documented by the ROM measurements therein was present prior the date of examination. 

Per a separate July 2020 private knee examination report seemingly also prepared by Dr. N.Z. and submitted with the above-detailed examination, Dr. N.Z. recorded flexion as limited to 40 degrees bilaterally with both active and passive motion and extension as "? pain" bilaterally with active motion. The report includes no indication or suggestion that the severity of limitation of extension documented by the ROM measurements therein was present prior the date of examination.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements. In October 2018, he reported, in part, that his knees were in constant pain and had worsened, with reference to a slip-and-fall he experienced in his home a couple years prior. See October 2018 Notice of Disagreement. 

After review of the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that the probative and persuasive evidence demonstrates that neither the service-connected left nor right knee limitation of extension approximated a 40 percent rating as of the date of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, and neither disability increased in severity so as to approximate a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5261 prior to July 8, 2020. As noted above, a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5261 requires extension to be limited to 30 degrees or worse. Here, while the Veteran underwent ROM testing as to his bilateral knees in the months prior to receipt of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ and thereafter but prior to July 8, 2020, the results of such testing did not remotely approach extension limited to 30 degrees or worse as to either knee. Instead, in all instances were tested during this period, he retained full ROM in extension for both knees.

Further, an alternative rating based on the Diagnostic Code 5010 portion of his hyphenated ratings under Diagnostic Code 5010-5261 would not allow for an effective date earlier than July 8, 2020, for the separate 40 percent rating as to either knee. Significantly, the highest rating available under the former Diagnostic Code 5010 (which is in turn rated under Diagnostic Code 5003) is only a 20 percent rating, and any compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 5010 is limited to situations where the limitation of motion of the specific joint or joints involved is non-compensable. 

Without the criteria for a 40 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 5261 being met as to either knee in the year prior to receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, as of the date of receipt of the September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ, or at any point thereafter but prior to July 8, 2020, an earlier effective date for the increased 40 percent ratings for left and right knee limitation of extension is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). Accordingly, the claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 8, 2020, for the assigned 40 percent ratings for service-connected left and right knee limitation of extension is denied.

In making the above findings, the Board is cognizant of the fact that the Veteran has used medication, including hydrocodone, to treat his overall joint pain. The Court has held that in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). More recently, the Court stated that the "the Board [is] obligated to discount the beneficial effects of the medication taken for each disability and evaluate the baseline severity of those disabilities" and held that "Jones applies in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disabilities where the relevant [diagnostic code] does not reference medication as a factor in evaluation." Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *15-19 (March 12, 2025). 

The Board notes, however, that neither Jones nor Ingram address how the Board is to discount the beneficial effects of medication, particularly when used as treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms and where examiners do not reasonably have the ability to assess range of motion both with and without use of medication. Remanding this appeal to order an addendum medical opinion based on Jones and Ingram, and in the lens of the rating criteria under § 4.71a, would almost certainly require an examiner to engage in medical speculation and would result in a medical opinion that lacks the degree of certainty to ascertain, even under the benefit-of-the-doubt standard, the impact of the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of a veteran's musculoskeletal disability in terms of range of motion. See, e.g., Hood v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 295, 298-99 (2005) (medical opinions that are speculative have "little probative value"). Significantly, one of the judges in McCarroll, joined by another judge in concurrence, expressed the same concern as to the implications of the holding in Jones: 

The requirement that the Secretary "may not consider the relief afforded by [a veteran's] medication when" applying the rating schedule, as Jones demands...invites medical speculation in trying to guess what a veteran's symptoms might be without the medication, or medical malpractice in the cessation of medication so that the veteran's symptoms without medication might be recorded. The former invites non-helpful guesswork by medical practitioners,...and the latter raises, at a minimum, serious ethical concerns that no court should encourage. That Jones essentially requires the Board to consider whether a medical examination is required to determine how serious a veteran's symptoms would have been in an alternate reality in which he or she was not taking his or her required medication should alone demonstrate the fallacy of the Jones holding.

McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 278 (2016) (internal citations omitted). Because it is highly unlikely that remand to obtain a retrospective medical opinion as to the ameliorative effects of medication on the severity of the Veteran's left and right knee limitation of extension prior to July 8, 2020 would result in a probative, non-speculative opinion as to such, the Board does not wish to further delay adjudication of the Veteran's appeal to engage in likely unfruitful further development pursuant to Jones and Ingram. 

Finally, the Board notes that VA compensation does not contemplate hypothetical symptoms or impairment. Instead, the purpose of VA benefits is to compensate for decreased earning capacity - to compensate for actual symptoms or impairment that an individual experiences in the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. If medications are taken regularly and effectively, that is, on an ordinary day the Veteran takes medications that improve functioning, then 38 C.F.R. § 4.10 specifically requires VA to rate his disability based on his actual functioning. The Veteran's manifestations of pain prior to July 8, 2020, have been considered in ascertaining when his left and right knee limitation of extension approximated a 40 percent rating, but it still remains the Board's obligation to rate the condition based on the application of the rating criteria found in the diagnostic codes to the objective medical evidence. 

TDIU & DEA

1. Entitlement to a TDIU from September 7, 2018, to July 8, 2020, to include for the purpose of providing for an earlier effective date of September 7, 2018, for the award of entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is unemployable due to his service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities. See, generally, VA Forms 21-8940. 

The Board notes that the relevant consideration period for entitlement to a TDIU extends to September 7, 2018. As discussed above, he has continuously pursued increased ratings for his service-connected knee disabilities since filing his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ through to the instant appeal. Because he formally filed for entitlement to a TDIU during the course of seeking increased ratings, the relevant consideration period as to entitlement to a TDIU also extends to the date of receipt of his September 2018 VA Form 21-526EZ-September 7, 2018. See, e.g., November 2019 & August 2021 VA Forms 21-8940; see also Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009). 

The Board finds that, contrary to the RO's determination in the December 2022 rating decision on appeal, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to July 8, 2020, is not moot. 

Per an August 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) based on his need for regular aid and attendance due to his service-connected disabilities, effective June 11, 2019, but the effective date of his award of entitlement to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 does not precede July 8, 2020-the effective date of his combined disability rating reaching 100 percent. While an award of SMC pursuant to § 1114(l) provides a greater monetary benefit than an award of entitlement to a TDIU, the Board notes that an award of SMC pursuant to § 1114(l) does not equate to a veteran having a service-connected disability that is rated permanent and total so as to warrant entitlement to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, as a veteran may require regular aid and attendance due to service-connected disabilities without the combination of his disabilities reaching 100 percent or without a disability rated at 100 percent being permanent in nature. Compare 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) and §§ 3500, 3501; compare 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021(a) and §§ 3.350(b), 3.352(a). Consequently, although the Veteran is in receipt of a greater monetary benefit than that available via an award of entitlement to a TDIU from June 11, 2019 onward, because he is in not in receipt of DEA until July 8, 2020, an award of entitlement to a TDIU could provide for an earlier effective date for the award of entitlement to DEA, and so the issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to July 8, 2020 is not moot.  

Throughout the relevant consideration period, the Veteran's combined rating is at least 70 percent, with his service-connected orthopedic disabilities (including left elbow, right shoulder, low back, and bilateral knee disabilities), for TDIU purposes, considered as one disability exceeding 40 percent; therefore, he meets the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU throughout the relevant consideration period. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

VA will grant TDIU benefits when the evidence shows that the Veteran is precluded, by reason of his service-connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. A substantially gainful occupation is as "an occupation that provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the Veteran actually works and without regard to the Veteran's earned annual income." Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000). Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. Substantially gainful employment is defined as work that is more than marginal, which permits the individual to earn a "living wage." Id.

Whether the veteran can find employment is not determinative; the focus of the inquiry is on "whether the veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment." See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court interpreted and defined the phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in § 4.16 to encompass two components: one economic and one noneconomic. Ray, 31 Vet. App. 58, 72 (2019).

The Court held the economic component "simply means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person." Id. at 73. Marginal employment may be held to exist on a facts-found basis when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold, known as "employment in a protected environment." 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. The Court recently defined this phrased to unambiguously mean "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 114 (2024).

Regarding the noneconomic component, the Court provided guidance "as to the meaning of a veteran's ability to 'secure and follow' such employment." The Court held that attention must be given to: the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue. Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 72. The Court noted that this is not "a checklist that must be run through in every case;" rather, "discussion of any factor is only necessary if the evidence raises it." Id.

As to the possibility of sedentary employment, specifically, the Court has instructed that "the meaning and relevance of the term ["sedentary employment"] will have to be discerned on a case-by-case basis from the medical and lay evidence presented and in light of each Veteran's education, training, and work history." Withers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 139 (2018). As such, the Board interprets sedentary to mean primarily working in an office-type setting with much of the day seated; noting that since "sedentary" is defined as "[r]equiring or marked by much sitting at a sedentary desk job," it interprets this definition to mean that the Veteran could work in a job where he primarily sits down. Webster's II New College Dictionary. The Department of Labor's Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) defines sedentary work as exerting up to 10 pounds of force occasionally (i.e., up to 1/3 of the time), and/or a negligible amount of force frequently (i.e., from 1/3 to 2/3 of the time) to lift, carry, push, pull, or otherwise move objects, including the human body. According to DOT's definition, sedentary work involves sitting most of the time but may involve walking or standing for brief periods of time. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required only occasionally and all other sedentary criteria are met.

Social Security Administration's (SSA) definition of sedentary employment is very similar and, according to SSA, has the same meaning as used in the DOT. 20 C.F.R. § 404.1567. SSA defines sedentary work as work that involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Id. Although a sedentary job is defined as one that involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Id. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met. Id.

The Veteran submitted VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability, in March 2015, May 2015, November 2019, and August 2021. Across these submissions, he reported previously working as a laborer from 1999 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2003. He further reported that his service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation, but he variably noted that he became too disabled to work in January 2003 in a few instances and January 2008 in another instance. As to educational history, he consistently marked that he completed one year of college.

Per a September 2007 SSA decision, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found, in part, that the Veteran had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since September 1, 2003.

Review of the Veteran's contemporaneous VA treatment records, VA examinations, and lay statements does not reveal or otherwise suggest that he was employed in any capacity since, at latest, November 2007. See, e.g., December 2007 Statement in Support of Claim ("I'm not working anymore as of 11-16-07"). Based on the above, the Board finds that the economic component of a TDIU claim is met throughout the relevant consideration period.

The Veteran's examinations, treatment records, and lay statements document the manifestations and functional impact of his service-connected musculoskeletal disabilities. As to his SSA records, which are discussed immediately below, the Board notes that VA is not bound by SSA's determinations; however, the legal criteria for entitlement to SSA disability benefits are similar to those for entitlement to a TDIU. Compare 20 C.F.R. § 416.905 with 38 C.F.R. § 4.16.

Per the September 2007 SSA decision, an ALJ found that the Veteran had severe impairments, including status post angioplasty, status post shoulder separation, degenerative disc disease, and right knee osteoarthritis, which caused significant limitation in his ability to perform basic work activities. The ALJ further found that he had the residual functional capacity to sit, stand, or walk for less than two hours each eight-hour workday, with rest breaks as needed; lift or carry less than ten pounds occasionally; and never perform postural maneuvers. The ALJ finally found that, considering his age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity, there are no jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy that he could perform, and so he had been under a disability for SSA purposes since September 1, 2003.

Per his May 2015 VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that he could not stand for long because of his knees, could not lift due to his shoulders, and could not carry much weight, bend, or do other things due to his back. He further reported that he could not even stand long enough to be a greeter at Walmart. 

At a June 2018 VA elbow examination, the Veteran reported experiencing mostly constant left elbow pain, which worsened at nighttime. An examiner marked that his left elbow disability did not impact his ability to perform any type of occupational task.

At a June 2018 VA knee examination, the Veteran reported that his knee pain worsened with climbing stairs and that he could not run but also that his knees did not give out anymore since he started using a walker with a seat. An examiner marked that his knee disabilities did not impact his ability to perform any type of occupational task. The Board affords only limited probative weight to the examiner's determinations in this examination report, however, because the examiner inaccurately and inconsistently stated that the Veteran's opposing joint was undamaged despite also documenting abnormal findings as both knees.

At a June 2018 VA back examination, the Veteran reported experiencing constant back pain worsened with walking and improved with laying down, which radiated to his lower extremities. He further reported regularly using a walker for balance when ambulating long distances. An examiner marked that his low back disability did not impact his ability to perform any type of occupational task. The Board affords only limited probative weight to the examiner's determinations in this examination report, however, because the examiner nonsensically included a statement that the opposing joint was undamaged and it was medically feasible to test the joint despite the thoracolumbar spine not having an opposing joint. 

At a September 2018 VA shoulder examination, the Veteran reported experiencing chronic right shoulder pain. In contrast to his prior right shoulder-related medical history and diagnoses, an examiner marked that his right shoulder disability did not involve ankylosis. Separately, the examiner noted that his right shoulder disability limited overhead activity but also stated that his service-connected medical conditions were not likely to impact his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful full-time sedentary employment-seemingly only with reference to his right shoulder disability rather than all of his service-connected disabilities.

At an October 2018 VA back examination, the Veteran reported experiencing a lot of pain in his back, which worsened with standing or walking for prolonged periods and flared about seven or eight times per month. He further reported regularly using a walker and occasionally using a wheelchair. 

At an October 2018 VA knee examination, the Veteran reported experiencing bilateral knee pain, which was worse in the mornings. He further reported using braces for his bilateral knee pain and both a walker and a wheelchair for both his back and his knees. As to functional impact, an examiner noted that his pain worsened with prolonged walking and standing. 

Per an April 2019 examination for housebound status or need for regular aid and attendance, the Veteran's VA provider documented, in part, that he could not prepare his own meals and required assistance in tending to hygiene needs because he ambulated with a walker and had an unsteady gait with chronic back and hip pain. The provider further documented that he denied having any restriction of the spine, trunk, and neck but also noted that he was able to leave home three times per week.

Per a July 2020 knee examination, a private examiner, Dr. N.Z. determined that the Veteran experienced less movement than normal, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, and interference with standing as additional contributing factors of his bilateral knee disabilities. Dr. N.Z. further determined that he experienced moderate lateral instability and recurrent subluxation as to both knees and documented that he constantly used a walker and regularly used braces as assistive devices. As to functional impact, Dr. N.Z. stated that he could not sit, stand, or walk for prolonged periods of time and that it is likely his bilateral knees would prevent him from working five days per week for 40 hours due to chronic pain as well as the need to rest throughout the day. 

Per a July 2020 back examination, Dr. N.Z. determined that the Veteran experienced less movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, and interference with standing as additional contributing factors of his low back disability. As to functional impact, Dr. N.Z. stated that he was unable to do prolonged standing, walking, and lifting due to back and knee pain, which would require him to lie down several hours per day. Dr. N.Z. further stated that his chronic pain would likely cause him to be off task approximately 25 percent of a typical workday, and so he would be unable to perform any work on a full-time basis. 

Per a July 2020 shoulder examination, Dr. N.Z. documented that the Veteran experienced significant pain and limitation of motion on his right side and that he has periods of time with difficulty moving his right shoulder. Dr. N.Z. determined that he experienced less movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement as additional contributing factors of his right shoulder disability. Dr. N.Z. further determined that he experienced reduced muscle strength in his right shoulder and ankylosis in abduction up to 60 degrees such that he could reach his mouth and head. As to functional impact, Dr. N.Z. stated that any overhead work would be difficult, and any prolonged lifting would likely cause pain. 

Per an August 2021 medical opinion, a private examiner, Dr. R.M. noted review of the Veteran's past medical history, listed his service-connected diagnoses, summarized his October 2018 and July 2020 VA examinations, and ultimately opined that his symptoms thereof would prevent him from working any type of full-time occupation and have since 2003. Dr. R.M. stated that his service-connected medical conditions, collectively, resulted in him being in chronic pain, for which he took daily prescription medication, and his associated symptoms have made both standing and sitting difficult for him. Dr. R.M. further stated that movement of his right shoulder and arm was difficult for him, and his chronic pain would cause him to miss greater than four workdays per month and severely impair his concentration levels. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records from across the relevant consideration period document a more severe range of symptoms and resultant functional impairment from his service-connected disabilities. For instance, in October 2018, he complained of chronic dull knee, back, and shoulder pain and reported that his fiancée was his caregiver, and she assisted him with getting in and out of the shower, putting on his socks, lacing up his shoes, and all cooking, cleaning, shopping, and laundry. A care coordinator determined that his caregiver provided help with basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living, and the Veteran required help or supervision with bathing, dressing, moving around indoors, preparing meals, performing housework, and shopping. See October 2018 Care Coordination Note. In October 2018 and July 2019, he reported experiencing constant low back pain radiating into his hip and right buttocks, depending on his activities, and constant numbness of the anterior thighs and feet associated with weakness. He further reported that his bilateral knee pain was aggravated by most activities. See October 2018 & July 2019 Orthopedic Clinic Notes. In August 2019, he reported having fallen twice in the last two weeks. See August 2019 Ambulatory Care Note. In March 2020, he reported having a housekeeper come three times weekly to help with household chores, bathing, and getting in and out of the shower. See March 2020 Psychology Pain Progress Note. In May 2020, he reported experiencing a back pain flare that left him unable to walk for two days and that he spent most of his days sedentary because he went into pain flares when he tried to walk. See May 2020 Psychology Pain Progress Note. 

After review of the lay and medical evidence, the Board finds that it is unlikely the Veteran could have obtained and maintained substantially gainful physically-intensive employment between September 2018 and July 2020. While, in multiple instances, VA examiners shortly prior to the appeal period marked that his service-connected disabilities did not impact his ability to work, examiners during the appeal period documented multiple limitations from his service-connected disabilities, such as reduced range of motion, difficulty bending, reliance on a walker and/or wheelchair, and difficulty walking or standing for prolonged periods. His treatment records document more severe limitations attributable to his service-connected disabilities, to include reliance on a caregiver for assistance in multiple activities of daily living, difficulty sitting for long periods, and a back pain flare-up that he reported left him unable to walk for two days.

The Board notes that there is evidence indicating that the Veteran is capable of sedentary employment despite his service-connected disabilities. The September 2018 VA examiner specifically opined that the "above [service-connected] medical conditions are not likely to impact his ability to obtain and maintain substantially gainful fulltime sedentary employment," but her opinion was seemingly only rendered as to his service-connected shoulder disability, as she did not conduct examinations of his additional service-connected disabilities. Further, to the extent that the September 2018 VA examiner sought to opine as to the impact of other service-connected disabilities on his ability to engage in sedentary employment, the Board notes that her opinion is inconsistent with the level of impairment documented in his VA treatment records from the same time period. For instance, as discussed above, less than a month after the September 2018 VA examination, a VA home health coordinator documented that he received assistance with both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, to include with reference to his chronic knee, back, and shoulder pain-all of which are service-connected. See October 2018 Care Coordination Note. Consequently, the Board is not persuaded by the September 2018 VA examiner's opinion as to the Veteran's employability. 

Overall, due to the Veteran's regular reliance on, at minimum, a walker for ambulation; his limitations in walking, sitting, and standing; his reported history of falls; and the likely impact of pain on his ability to concentrate and stay on task (as opined by both Dr. N.Z. and Dr. R.M.), all of which are at least partially attributable to symptoms and resultant impairment from his service-connected disabilities, and combined with the fact that an SSA ALJ found that his severe impairments, which largely included his service-connected disabilities, caused significant limitation in his ability to perform basic work activities such that he had the residual functional capacity to sit, stand, or walk for less than two hours each eight hour work day, the Board finds that evidence as to his ability to engage in the physical demands of even sedentary employment, regardless of his educational and work history, is in relative evidence equipoise. 

Where the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails; therefore, the Board finds that, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, it is unlikely the Veteran could have obtained or maintained substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities, in combination, from September 7, 2018-the date of his continuously pursued increased rating claim-through to at least July 8, 2020-the effective date of his combined 100 percent rating and prior effective date of entitlement to DEA. Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391, 1395 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102.

2. Entitlement to a TDIU from July 8, 2020, onward is dismissed as moot.

Notwithstanding the above, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from July 8, 2020, onward is moot. 

The Board recognizes that it is not categorically true that the grant of a total schedular disability rating necessarily moots a TDIU claim, particularly as this relates to possible entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293-94 (2008); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 248 (2010). VA has a duty to maximize a veteran's benefits, including consideration of possible entitlement to SMC in addition to a total disability rating. See Akles v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 118, 121 (1991). Under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), SMC is payable where the Veteran has a service-connected disability rated as total, and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of such veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. The disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more must be separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). In Bradley, the Court held that a TDIU rating can qualify for compensation at the § 1114(s) housebound rate, but only if the TDIU is based on a single disability. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).

Here, however, as referenced above, the Veteran is in receipt of a combined 100 percent rating for his service-connected disabilities, SMC pursuant to § 1114(l), and DEA from, at least, July 8, 2020, onward. Even if the Veteran were awarded entitlement to a TDIU based on a single service-connected disability for the purposes of SMC pursuant to § 1114(s), SMC pursuant to § 1114(1) provides a greater monetary benefit, and there is no authority to pay both awards simultaneously. Compare 38 U.S.C. § 1114(l) ($3,327) and 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) ($2,993).

In making the above finding, the Board recognizes that, in a recent decision, the Court found that the Board did not provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases in a prior decision finding that an award under section 1114(l) moots the issue of entitlement to an award under section 1114(s). See Frazier v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 244 (2024). The Court stated: "The Secretary explains that without a decision on the remaining SMC claim, the Board was unable to determine whether the veteran would have been entitled to payment of SMC at a higher rate under section 1114(p)." Id. at 260-261. 

Section 1114(p) provides that "in the event the veteran's service-connected disabilities exceed the requirements for any of the prescribed rates in this section, the Secretary may allow the next higher rate or an intermediate rate, but in no event in excess of $4,667." 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p); see Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 807, 142 S. Ct. 2528, 213 L. Ed. 2d 956 (2022) (holding that "'may' means 'may'" and provides agencies with discretion). "The Secretary has implemented § 1114(p)'s discretionary clause in various provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(f)." See Barry v. McDonough, 101 F.4th 1348, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2024).

Section 3.350(f) authorizes an intermediate or next higher rate when any of the conditions listed within the paragraph are satisfied. Although there are several conditions itemized, the Secretary did not use his discretionary authority to include an award of SMC under 38 U.S.C. 1114(s) as an avenue for entitlement to an increase under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p) because he did not include it in his regulation. Because the regulation uses the phrase "authorized by this paragraph," the Board finds that § 3.350(f) is the only authority under which the Board can award an intermediate or next higher rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p)'s discretionary clause.

In addition to its discretionary clause, 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p) has several requirements under which the Secretary shall allow a higher rate. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(p). However, an award of SMC under § 1114(s) is not included in the mandatory portion of § 1114(p). Therefore, the Board finds that an award under § 1114(s) could not, in and of itself, entitle the Veteran to an increase under § 1114(p) or its implementing regulation. Therefore, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU from July 8, 2020, onward, to include for the purpose of SMC pursuant to § 1114(s), due to the Veteran's receipt of SMC under § 1114(l) from June 11, 2019, onward, is moot and must be dismissed.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of September 7, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of entitlement to DEA is granted. 

The Veteran was initially awarded entitlement to DEA benefits, effective June 17, 2021, in a September 2021 rating decision, and he was, more recently, awarded an earlier effective date of July 8, 2020, for such in a December 2022 rating decision. 

Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits may be paid to dependents of a veteran who has a service-connected disability that is rated permanent and total. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021. A total disability may be assigned where a veteran's service-connected disabilities are rated 100 percent disabling under the rating schedule, or if the veteran is unemployable due to service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 3.341. Eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance begins on any date between: (1) the effective date of the rating decision, and (2) the date of notification to the person from whom eligibility is derived. 38 U.S.C. § 3512 (a), (d).

As discussed above, the Board has granted entitlement to a TDIU from September 7, 2018, to July 8, 2020; therefore, the Veteran is now in receipt of a service-connected disability rated permanent and total from September 7, 2018, and so an effective date of September 7, 2018, for the award of entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is now warranted.

The record does not support finding that the Veteran had "a total disability permanent in nature resulting from a service-connected disability" prior to September 7, 2018. Prior to September 7, 2018, the Veteran's combined disability was, at most, 80 percent. Consequently, September 7, 2018, is the earliest date on which the Veteran had a total disability which was permanent in nature due to service-connected disabilities. An earlier date cannot be established for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits because the Veteran was not rated at 100 percent prior to September 7, 2018.

Accordingly, an effective date of September 7, 2018, but no earlier, for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is granted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510.
