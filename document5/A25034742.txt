ORDER

The appeal for initial eligibility and any accrued benefits under VA's Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of the Veteran's death, no benefits had accrued that can be awarded to the Appellant in this case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal for PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. 

§§ 7104, 71.20, 5121, 5121A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000, 3.1010, 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1966 to July 1968.  He was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with Bronze Star and Vietnam Campaign Medal with 60 Device, among other decorations, for this service.  The Veteran died in January 2025 and the Appellant is his surviving spouse and co-applicant for benefits under the PCAFC.  The case is on appeal from a decision of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Appellant elected direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record that was before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction at the time of the April 2021 decision on appeal. 38C.F.R. § 20.303.

Benefits under VA's PCAFC.

The Appellant in this case is the Veteran's surviving spouse and co-applicant for benefits under the VA's PCAFC program.  Unfortunately, in January 2025 the Veteran died prior to final approval of participation in the PCAFC.  The Appellant contends that entitlement to accrued benefits are warranted for the period of care prior to the Veteran's death. After review of the evidence, the Board finds that as a matter of law it is unable to grant accrued benefits under the PCAFC.

As an initial matter, the Board thanks the Veteran's caregiver-spouse for her dedication to the care of the Veteran.

The PCAFC differs from many other benefits available to veterans and their families through the VA.  As discussed below, one difference is that final approval and participation in the PCAFC is dependent on a series of steps that include legal and medical determinations, as well as practical steps such as in-home evaluations, before a Caregiver receives final approval and benefits under the program.  Further, continued participation in the program is dependent on periodic recertification.  Because the Veteran died before completion of all of these steps required for participation in the PCAFC, at the time of his death he was not an eligible veteran as defined under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 and no monetary benefits were due at that time.  As such, no benefits had been accrued at the time of the Veteran's death to pay to the Appellant.

Laws and Regulations

The award of accrued benefits is governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5121, which in pertinent states that:

[P]eriodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemen's indemnity) under laws administered by the Secretary to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions or those based on evidence in the file at date of death (hereinafter in this section and section 5122 of this title [38 U.S.C. § 5122] referred to as "accrued benefits") and due and unpaid, shall, upon the death of such individual be paid as follows...

38 U.S.C. § 5121.

Next, decisions as to eligibility under a Caregiver Program have been held to be subject to Board review.  See Beaudette v. McDonough, 34?Vet. App.?95, 105 (2021) affirmed by 93 F.4th 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2024).

The PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers. 38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).  An "eligible veteran" means a veteran, or a servicemember, who is found eligible for a Family Caregiver under §71.20. 38 C.F.R. § 71.20.  A "primary family caregiver" means an individual who meets the requirements of §71.25. Id. 

However, a finding that both a veteran and a caregiver meet the eligibly criteria does not complete the process for final approval and participation in the PCAFC.  The requirements under § 71.25 further state that before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must (1) be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training, and (2) complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements. See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c), (d).  The Board observes the indication that the requirements must be met before final approval of PCAFC benefits can be completed.

After completion of caregiver training the VA then visits the eligible veteran's home to assess the eligible veteran's well-being and the well-being of the caregiver, as well as the caregiver's competence to provide personal care services at the eligible veteran's home.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(e).

Final approval and designation for the Caregiver Program benefits is conditioned on the both the Veteran and the caregiver meeting and completing all the above listed criteria.  Continuance in the program is dependent on the Veteran and caregiver "remaining eligible" for Caregiver Program benefits, including the caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements.  38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f).

Finally, discharge from the PCAFC program is required upon the death of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 71.45(b).

Analysis

After review of the evidence, the Board finds that because the Veteran was not an "eligible Veteran" under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 at the time of his death, that no benefit accrued or can be awarded to the Appellant in this case.  See also 38 U.S.C. 

§ 5121. Specifically, under 38 U.S.C. § 5121 benefits shall be paid where an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions or those based on evidence in the file at date of death.  At the time of the Veteran's death final approval for the PCAFC had not been established.  Because the Veteran died before final approval into the PCAFC had been established, the CSP did not proceed with subsequent steps in the application process including a final application review with notice of approval.  To be sure, all of the steps must be completed before an award is issued under the PCAFC.  38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f).  As such, at the time of the Veteran's death there was not an existing rating or evidence in the file that could, under any circumstance, produce an award of benefits.  While the Board understands the frustration experienced in this case by the Appellant without final approval and designation for participation in the PCAFC no benefits were accrued or can be awarded and here, there is no process or possibility that would allow the claim to reach final approval and designation.

The Board is mindful that the notification letters sent in this case are not entirely compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 5104 and that a remand may provide additional medical and procedural documents in the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 1720(G)(12). However, the basis for the April 2021 denial letter is part of the record and sufficient other documentation to verify that the Appellant's PCAFC claim was not finally approved prior to the Veteran's death.  As such, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  Hence, any error is nonprejudicial, and remand for correction of these errors would not have any reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

Finally, the Board has reviewed the entire record and is sympathetic to the Appellant's argument.  However, here, the Board is bound by law. While the Board is sympathetic, it is bound by the statutory scheme created by Congress and is not permitted to award payments other than as authorized by Congress. Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992) (citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990)).  Therefore, this appeal must be denied as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.
