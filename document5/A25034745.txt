ORDER

Service connection for a right hip disability is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has a current right hip disability that began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a right hip disability are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1984 to August 1984.  An additional period of service from April 1988 to August 1988 is also considered active service based on the grant of service connection for a right knee injury that was incurred in the line of duty.  

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Veteran submitted evidence after the AOJ decision on appeal, which the Board could not consider.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran has not raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

Service connection for a right hip disability is denied.

The Veteran asserts he has a current right hip disability that is related to active service.  The Veteran further states he has a right hip replacement and that he experienced severe degenerative arthritis of the right hip for years prior to his right hip replacement.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ (Fully Developed Claim).  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The presumption of service connection applies to anyone who served on active duty for 90 days of active, continuous service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(1); Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 478 (1991).  Post-service development of arthritis to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, establishes a rebuttable presumption that the disease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that an appellant will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in approximate balance with the negative evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is related to any in-service injury, event, or disease.

As an initial matter, the Board is bound by the favorable findings reached by the AOJ in its rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Here, the AOJ favorably found the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a right hip replacement.

The Board notes that the Veteran originally filed a service connection claim for right hip replacement.  June 2023 Fully Developed Claim.  In Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, in determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; symptoms described; and the information submitted or developed in support of the claim.  Id. at 5.  The record indicates the Veteran has multiple diagnoses of the right hip, including right hip osteoarthritis and status post right hip replacement.  March 2018 private treatment records.  Thus, in light of the Court's decision in Clemons, the Board has re-characterized the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for a right hip disability.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of a right hip disability, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that an in-service event, injury, or disease occurred to the right hip or that the Veteran's diagnosis of right hip disability began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

Service treatment records are silent for any in-service complaints or treatment related to the right hip.  A Report of Medical Examination and Report of Medical History from June 1986 are both silent for right hip symptoms.  

Private treatment records show the Veteran was not diagnosed with right hip arthritis until March 2018, decades after separation from service.  March 2018 private treatment records show the Veteran's right hip symptoms had been occurring for approximately six months.  The Veteran has not otherwise indicated on which date his right hip symptoms began.  Private treatment records do not indicate any relationship between any current right hip disability and active service.  

Moreover, the Veteran has not provided VA with any information or evidence regarding an in-service event, injury, or disease which he believes is related to any current right hip disability.  

Further, the Veteran does not assert and the evidence does not show that his right hip arthritis manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty, and there is no lay or medical evidence of continuity of symptomatology.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.303(b), 3.309.   

While the Veteran's reports of right hip symptoms are credible, the Veteran is not competent to provide a nexus opinion demonstrating any current right hip disability is related to any event, injury, or disease during active service.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires knowledge of the interaction between multiple systems in the body and the causation and progression of musculoskeletal diseases.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

The Board acknowledges there is no VA medical opinion of record regarding the claim of service connection for the Veteran's current right hip disability.  Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006), in initial service connection claims, the VA must provide a VA medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim.  The threshold for determining whether the evidence "indicates" that there "may" be a nexus between a current disability and an in-service event, injury, or disease is a low one.  McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83. 

While the Veteran has provided competent evidence of a current disability, he has not submitted evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease of the right hip occurred in service.  Moreover, the record does not indicate that any current right hip disability may be associated with the veteran's service.  Therefore, the evidence of record in this case does not meet the low bar triggering entitlement to a VA medical examination.  See id.

Because the evidence of record weighs persuasively against granting the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
