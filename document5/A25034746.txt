FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A bilateral knee brace worn to treat a service-connected disability during the 2021 calendar year tended to wear out or tear the Veteran's clothing.

2. A back brace worn to treat a service-connected disability during the 2021 calendar year tended to wear out or tear the Veteran's clothing.

3. An elbow brace worn to treat a service-connected disability during the 2021 calendar year tended to wear out or tear the Veteran's clothing.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a clothing allowance for a bilateral knee brace are met for calendar year 2021.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

2. The criteria for a clothing allowance for a back brace are met for calendar year 2021.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had several periods of active-duty service in the United States Army.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 29, 2021, decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) as the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

On July 22, 2021, the Veteran appealed to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement).  He elected the Direct Review Docket under the modernized appeal review system ("AMA").  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that the Veteran originally applied for clothing allowances for use of a back brace (used to treat a back condition), knee brace (used to treat a bilateral knee condition), elbow brace (used to treat tendonitis of the elbow), foot inserts (used to treat a bilateral foot condition) Ammonium lactate (used to treat a skin condition), and Clotrimazole steroid cream (used to treat a skin condition).  In its July 2021 decision, the AOJ denied all six claims.  The AOJ found that neither the Ammonium lactate nor the Clotrimazole steroid cream caused irreparable permanent stains to the Veteran's outer clothing that could not be removed by regular laundering or dry cleaning.  The AOJ found that shoe inserts did not impact the Veteran's clothing and were therefore not eligible for a clothing allowance.  The AOJ found that there was no evidence in the record demonstrating that the Veteran had been issued a knee brace or a back brace that would qualify for a clothing allowance and that his elbow brace did not have any parts that would have possibly damaged the Veteran's clothing.

The Board further notes that in his VA Form 10182, the Veteran only appealed the AOJ's denial of clothing allowances for the 2021 calendar year for use of a bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace.

Accordingly, in the decision below, the Board will only address the Veteran's claims seeking entitlement to clothing allowances during the 2021 calendar year for use of a bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace. 

Clothing Allowances

The Veteran is seeking entitlement to annual clothing allowances for the 2021 calendar year for use of a bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace.

Payment of an annual clothing allowance is allowed for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran, or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.

The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1)(ii).

A second clothing allowance is available for a single type of garment if a veteran uses more than one prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, medication for more than one skin condition, or an appliance and a medication, and the appliances or medications (i) satisfy the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1); and (ii) together tend to wear or tear a single garment or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing due to a second appliance or medication.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

The Veteran contends that using a bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace caused wear and tear to clothing during the 2021 calendar year.  A review of the record shows that service connection is in effect for (1) right and left knee chondromalacia, (2) left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy, (3) thoracolumbar spine degenerative disk disease with intervertebral disc syndrome, and (4) left upper extremity peripheral neuropathy involving the long thoracic nerve with carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis of the shoulder rotator cuff, biceps, and wrist, elbow epicondylitis, and left ring finger sprain, status post left ring finger fracture.

The evidence of record reflects that the Veteran was, in fact, prescribed a knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace for treatment associated with his service-connected knee/lower extremity, back, and elbow disabilities.  

Moreover, the evidence supports the award of clothing allowances in 2021 for the Veteran's use of the bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace.  In that regard, the Veteran is competent to describe irreparable damage to his clothing inasmuch as such effect is readily observable by a lay person, and the medical evidence generally corroborates the Veteran's lay statements as well as the assertions made by the Veteran's representative on his behalf during the appeal period.  See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331,1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  In sum, the Board finds that the criteria for clothing allowances for 2021 are met based on the use of a bilateral knee brace, a back brace, and an elbow brace for service-connected disabilities.  The claims on appeal are granted.
