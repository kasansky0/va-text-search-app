FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. On June 6, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) requesting readjudication of a previously denied claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus. In an August 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate service connection for diabetes mellitus and denied the claim on the merits. 

2. The Veteran responded to the August 2023 denial of the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus with a VA Form 20-0995 on August 8, 2023, again requesting readjudication of the claim.

3. While the August 8, 2023 supplemental claim was pending, the Veteran also filed a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR)) on October 15, 2023. 

4. The AOJ incorrectly accepted the October 2023 request for HLR and adjudicated the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus in the November 6, 2023 HLR decision.

5. The October 15, 2023 VA Form 20-0996 was an impermissible concurrent election of administrative review following the August 2023 rating decision, and the November 6, 2023 HLR decision is not considered an appealable decision under the AMA for the purposes of a Board appeal. 

6. The evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus is etiologically related to service connected hypertension.

7. The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is associated with service connected hypertension; the Veteran is in receipt of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on loss of use of a creative organ.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from the November 6, 2023 HLR decision are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

2. The criteria for service connection for diabetes mellitus as secondary to service connected hypertension are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.310.

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from June 1974 to October 1974 and from June 1979 to July 1986. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision, a September 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) decision, and a November 2023 HLR decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) automatically applies to all claims for which VA issues notice of an initial decision on or after February 19, 2019. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400 (a)(1). Here, the decisions on appeal were issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in response to the Veteran's claims for increased ratings and claims to readjudicate service connection for previously denied disabilities. The August 2023, September 2023, and November 2023 decisions constitute initial decisions, and the AMA applies.

This case has a complex procedural history due, in part, to the number of claims filed and decisions issued by VA. The Board finds that a chronological review of the procedural history is necessary to clarify the claims on appeal, as well as the Board's jurisdiction.

On January 5, 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits) requesting readjudication of the claim for service connection for prostate cancer. Another VA Form 21-526EZ was received on April 8, 2023 claiming increased ratings for service connected PTSD and erectile dysfunction and requesting readjudication of a claim for service connection sleep apnea. A VA form 20-0995 (Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim) was also received on May 9, 2023 duplicating the claims for readjudication of service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea. The Veteran filed additional VA Forms 20-0095 on June 6, 2023 pertaining to claims to readjudicate service connection for diabetes mellitus and on July 7, 2023 claiming a compensable evaluation for hypertension. 

In a July 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claims for service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea. The claims were then denied on the merits. Similarly, in an August 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim for service connection diabetes mellitus and also denied that claim on the merits.

A second rating decision issued in August 2023 continued the current 70 percent evaluation for PTSD and the noncompensable evaluation for erectile dysfunction. 

A third rating decision generated in August 2023 continued a noncompensable rating for service connected hypertension effective July 7, 2023, while also noting that the evaluation for hypertension was "discontinued on November 15, 2019." Notice of the rating decision and continuation of a 0 percent evaluation for hypertension was mailed to the Veteran on September 11, 2023. 

As a historical note, the Board observes that a February 2020 rating code sheet includes a notation following an entry for hypertension stating, "unable to evaluate-discontinue" and indicates the 0 percent evaluation for the disability was discontinued on November 15, 2019. The Veteran was not notified of the discontinuance of the evaluation assigned to his service connected hypertension, but the record does not indicate that his disability compensation benefits were impacted or reduced by the change. In any event, the September 11, 2023 rating decision restored the noncompensable evaluation for hypertension from July 7, 2023 and denied a higher evaluation. 

On August 25, 2023, in response to the July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 (Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review) requesting readjudication of the claims for service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea. 

In response to the Veteran's August 2023 request for HLR, a HLR decision was issued in September 2023 confirming and continuing the denials of service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea. 

The Veteran filed an additional VA Form 20-0996 in October 2023, requesting HLR for multiple claims. The Veteran requested HLR for the August 2023 denial of higher ratings for PTSD and erectile dysfunction, as well as the September 11, 2023 rating decision's denial of a compensable rating for hypertension. 

Although the Veteran also requested HLR of the denials of service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea, the Board finds that the VA Form 20-0996 cannot be accepted, as the AOJ had already performed a HLR of these claims in September 2023. The Veteran was informed the October 2023 VA Form 20-0996 could not be accepted with respect to the claims for service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea in a November 3, 2023 letter.

The AOJ responded to the October 2023 VA Form 20-0996 in November 2023, with the issuance of a HLR decision based on the evidence of record at the time of the earlier August 2023 and September 2023 rating decisions. The HLR decision continued the current ratings assigned the service connected PTSD, erectile dysfunction, and hypertension. Notice of the HLR decision was mailed to the Veteran on November 6, 2023. 

On January 24, 2024, the Veteran filed his VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal). The VA Form 10182 disagreed with multiple adjudications in multiple rating decisions. First, and most recent, the Veteran disagreed with the denial of higher ratings for PTSD, erectile dysfunction, and hypertension in the November 2023 HLR decision. The Veteran also disagreed with the denial of service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea in the September 2023 HLR decision. The VA Form 10182 is also timely with respect to the denial of service connection for diabetes mellitus in the August 2023 rating decision. 

The Veteran elected to place this appeal on the Direct Review docket. As a valid and timely VA Form 10182 was received, the appeal is properly before the Board with respect to the specific claims identified above. 

The VA Form 10182 also expressed disagreement with the denial of service connection for diabetes mellitus in the November 2023 HLR decision; however, this claim is addressed below and is dismissed as it was improperly adjudicated in the November 2023 HLR. 

Similarly, the VA Form 10182 requested Board review of the denial of a compensable evaluation for hypertension in the September 11, 2023 rating decision. This claim is also not before the Board, as the Veteran had already responded to the September 2023 rating decision with the October 15, 2023 request for HLR. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A) (prohibiting claimants from taking simultaneous actions with respect to the same claim or same issue within the claim). The claim was adjudicated in the November 2023 HLR decision, and the Board has accepted the appeal with respect to the November 2023 HLR denial of a higher rating for hypertension. 

As noted above, the Veteran elected to place this appeal on the Direct Review docket on the January 2024 VA Form 10182. Thus, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision (service connection for prostate cancer and sleep apnea adjudicated in the September 2023 HLR decision), the August 2023 rating decision (diabetes mellitus), the second August 2023 rating decision (PTSD and erectile dysfunction adjudicated in the November 2023 HLR decision) and the September 11, 2023 rating decision (hypertension). In other words, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the July 2023 rating decision, two August 2023 rating decisions, and the September 11, 2023 rating decision with respect to the specific claims addressed by each decision.

Dismissal

1. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from a November 6, 2023 HLR decision.

The Veteran's January 24, 2024 VA Form 10182 requested Board review of two separate AOJ denials of service connection for diabetes mellitus. For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that the appeal for service connection originating for an August 2023 rating decision is properly before the Board, while the appeal for service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from a November 6, 2023 HLR decision must be dismissed.

As discussed above, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus on June 6, 2023. The AOJ responded with an August 2023 rating decision finding that new and relevant evidence had been submitted to readjudicate the claim. The claim for service connection for diabetes was then denied on the merits. 

The Veteran filed a second VA Form 20-0995 on August 8, 2023 again requesting readjudication of the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus. Two months later, on October 15, 2023, the Veteran also filed a VA Form 20-0996 requesting HLR of the same claim in the August 2023 rating decision. The inclusion of diabetes mellitus on the October 2023 VA Form 20-0996 was improper, as the Veteran had already filed an administrative review request (i.e., supplemental claim) of the August 2023 rating decision that was still pending. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A) (prohibiting claimants from taking simultaneous actions with respect to the same claim or same issue within the claim). 

Despite the presence of a pending VA Form 20-0995, the AOJ accepted the Veteran's request for HLR of the August 2023 denial of service connection for diabetes mellitus. The denial of service connection was confirmed and continued in the HLR decision issued on November 6, 2023. The Veteran then filed the January 2024 VA Form 10182 requesting a Board appeal of the November 2023 HLR denial. However, as noted above, the November 2023 HLR decision improperly adjudicated the issue of service connection for diabetes mellitus, and it is not considered an appealable decision for the purposes of Board review. As such, the appeal for service connection for diabetes mellitus stemming from the November 6, 2023 HLR decision must be dismissed as it does not originate from an appealable decision for the purposes of the AMA. 

As a final matter, the Board notes that it has accepted the Veteran's Board appeal of the denial of service connection for diabetes mellitus in the August 2023 rating decision. Although the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 requesting readjudication of the claim on August 8, 2023, this supplemental claim was not pending at the time of the January 2024 VA Form 10182. The AOJ issued a rating decision on January 17, 2024 finding that new and relevant evidence had not been received to readjudicate service connection for diabetes mellitus. Thus, the January 2024 rating decision resolved the Veteran's August 8, 2023 supplemental claim, and it was not "running concurrently" at the time of the January 24, 2024 VA Form 10182. See Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1, 14 (2023) ("A claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option."). Additionally, the Veteran's August 2023 VA Form 20-0995 initiated a claim to determine whether new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate service connection for diabetes mellitus, while the current appeal before the Board addresses the denial of service connection for diabetes on the merits in the August 2023 rating decision. The two claims are therefore not identical.

In sum, the claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from a November 6, 2023 HLR decision is dismissed as it was improperly adjudicated by the AOJ due to the Veteran's impermissible concurrent election of HLR. The Board may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect, such as improper docketing of an appeal. See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021). Due to this procedural defect, the Board will dismiss the claim for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from the November 6, 2023 HLR decision at this time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b); Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The claim for service connection for diabetes mellitus originating from the August 2023 rating decision is properly before the Board and is addressed below. 

Service Connection

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, to include as secondary to service-connected hypertension.

The Veteran contends that service connection is warranted for diabetes mellitus as it was incurred during active duty service, or in the alternative, as it is secondary to service connected hypertension. The Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance regarding whether service connection is warranted for diabetes on a secondary basis. The Board will therefore resolve any doubt in favor of the Veteran and grant the claim for diabetes mellitus on a secondary basis.

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (a) and (b). See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

The August 2023 rating decision on appeal includes favorable findings relevant to the claim. First, the AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate service connection for diabetes mellitus. The Board observes that the claim for service connection for diabetes was initially denied in a December 2002 rating decision and November 2020 Board decision under the Legacy system. The AOJ determined that new and relevant evidence had been received since the November 2020 Board decision. Second, the AOJ determined that a current disability was present as a July 2023 VA examination report confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The Board is bound by the RO's favorable findings, absent clear and unmistakable error (CUE). 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

The remaining question for the Board is whether the evidence establishes a link between the Veteran's diabetes mellitus and service connected hypertension. The Board finds that the competent evidence is in approximate balance regarding an etiological relationship between the two disorders.

The claimant bears the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a); Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2009). However, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all of the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990).

The benefit of the doubt doctrine, however, is not applicable based on "pure speculation or remote possibility." Fagan, 573 F.3d at 1287. Rather, the evidence must rise to a state of relative equipoise for the veteran to prevail. See Skoczen v. Shinseki, 564 F.3d 1319, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) rejected the idea that a veteran must be awarded benefits unless VA produces affirmative evidence refuting the claim. See Skoczen, 564 F.3d at 1329. Instead, the Federal Circuit concluded that if zero evidence is produced in support of a material issue, 1) it may be that no evidence exists to support the particular issue, in which case VA can rule against the claim; or 2) VA may have failed its duty to assist. Id.

In this case, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance regarding a link between diabetes and hypertension. Private treatment records indicate a relationship between the two conditions. In June 2002, the Veteran's private primary care doctor noted the Veteran's history of hypertension and that a recent non-fasting blood sugar laboratory reading was elevated. The Veteran was diagnosed with hyperglycemia. A few weeks later, the Veteran experienced the onset of blurry vision and went to a private emergency department for high blood sugar. He was diagnosed with new onset diabetes mellitus with "concomitant hypertension." 

The record also contains medical opinions weighing both for and against the claim. The Veteran's private doctor opined in August 2008 and December 2010 letters to VA that the Veteran's hypertension and diabetes mellitus were both "part of the metabolic syndrome" and there was a "high probability" the Veteran's hypertension contributed to the development of his diabetes mellitus. 

Weighing against the claim are April 2019, June 2019, and December 2019 medical opinion reports from VA examiners. The April 2019 VA examiner found there was "no evidence" hypertension and diabetes cause each other, while the June 2019 VA opinion report noted hypertension "has no bearing on blood sugars." The December 2019 VA medical opinion also found the evidence did not "definitively" support a link between hypertension and diabetes. However, the December 2019 VA examiner also noted it is "accepted there is link between the two conditions" though the exact nature of the link was undetermined. The VA examiner cited to a 2019 journal article that specifically evaluated whether hypertension might be a causal etiology for diabetes. The study affirmed "the commonly accepted link between the two conditions," but concluded further investigation was necessary. Thus, while concluding that there is no relationship between the Veteran's hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the December 2019 VA examiner acknowledged the established link between the two conditions.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance regarding a link between the Veteran's hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Private treatment records indicate the Veteran's diabetes was associated with hypertension when it was first identified in 2002. The record also contains medical opinions weighing both for and against the claim, with the private and VA opinions acknowledging an established link between the two conditions, even if the exact mechanism for the link is not fully understood. The Board will therefore resolve any doubt in favor of the Veteran and finds that service connection is warranted for diabetes mellitus as secondary to service-connected hypertension. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Increased Rating

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.

Service connection for erectile dysfunction secondary to hypertension was granted in a December 2019 rating decision. An initial noncompensable evaluation was assigned effective November 14, 2019. The December 2019 rating decision also awarded special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the loss of use of a creative organ due to erectile dysfunction. The November 2023 HLR decision on appeal continued the current noncompensable evaluation. 

A noncompensable disability rating is the maximum schedular rating available under Diagnostic Code 7522, and a higher rating is not assignable under this code. Furthermore, no other diagnostic code is more applicable. See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (holding that the Board's choice of diagnostic code should be upheld if supported by explanation and evidence). One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the current diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology. Any change in a diagnostic code by VA must be specifically explained. Pernorio v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 625 (1992).

The Veteran is service connected for erectile dysfunction indicating difficulty in achieving and maintaining an erection. The competent medical and lay evidence, including a July 2023 VA examination, establishes the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is caused by service connected hypertension and nonservice-connected residuals of prostate cancer. Diagnostic Code 7522 does not provide for a compensable evaluation for erectile dysfunction, and the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum possible rating. A compensable initial rating is therefore not possible. 

The Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions that he has difficulty obtaining and maintaining an erection, but these symptoms are compensated by his award of SMC and do not provide a basis to assign a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7522. Therefore, a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is not possible, and the claim must be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.

The Board has also considered whether there is any other schedular basis for granting a compensable rating, but has found none. In addition, the Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is not applicable because the evidence significantly and substantially weighs against the claim for an increased rating. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD. 

2. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hypertension.

3. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.

4. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.

The Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional error of the duty to assist. Specifically, efforts must be made to obtain private records of medical treatment relevant to the claims.

VA treatment records dated during the relevant rating period document the Veteran's reports of medical treatment with a private primary care doctor. Records of this medical treatment are relevant to the claims before the Board and efforts must be made to obtain them to comply with VA's duty to assist the Veteran.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for his private primary care doctor, as well as any other private healthcare providers who have treated his PTSD, hypertension, sleep apnea, and prostate cancer since 2022. 

If medical release forms are received, make two requests for the authorized records from the identified providers, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
