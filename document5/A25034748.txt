ORDER

Entitlement to annual clothing allowance benefits for use of various topical medications (Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% ointment; Tretinoin 0.025% cream; Clindamycin Phosphate 1% topical solution; Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% scrub; and Diclofenac 1% topical gel) during calendar year 2020 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During calendar year 2020, the Veteran's prescribed topical medications were not used to treat a service-connected skin condition.

2.  During calendar year 2020, there were no provisions in the law that allowed VA to award a clothing allowance for use of topical medications for service-connected disabilities other than skin disabilities.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a clothing allowance for use of various topical medications during calendar year 2020 are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1982 to February 1984.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 30, 2020, decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket under the modernized appeal review system ("AMA").  Under the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Clothing Allowance(s)

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran, or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.

One annual clothing allowance per year is payable in a lump sum, when the following eligibility criteria are satisfied: (1) A VA examination or examination report from a private physician as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.326(c) discloses that the veteran wears or uses certain prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which tend to wear or tear clothing (including a wheelchair) because of such service-connected disability or disabilities and such service-connected disability is the loss or loss of use of a hand or foot compensable at a rate specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a), (b), (c), (d), or (f); or (2) The Undersecretary for Health or a designee certifies that, because of such service-connected disability or disabilities, a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance is worn or used which tends to wear or tear the veteran's clothing, or that because of the use of a physician-prescribed medication for a skin condition that is due to the service-connected disability or disabilities, irreparable damage is done to the Veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162; 38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a).

A veteran is entitled to an annual clothing allowance for each such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) or medication used by the veteran if each appliance or medication affects a distinct type of article of clothing or outer garment.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(2).  A veteran is entitled to two annual clothing allowances if a veteran uses more than one such prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair), medication for more than one skin condition, or an appliance and a medication, and appliance(s) or medication(s) together tend to wear or tear a single type of article of clothing or irreparably damage a type of outer garment at an increased rate of damage to the clothing or outer garment due to a second appliance or medication.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(3).

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran filed an application for an annual clothing allowance in April 2020.  That claim was received by the AOJ in June 2020.  He indicated that he was seeking clothing allowance benefits for use of the following prescribed topical medications during calendar year 2020: Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% ointment (for a lower back and side skin disorder); Tretinoin 0.025% cream (for a back and side skin disorder); Clindamycin Phosphate 1% topical solution (for a back and side skin disorder); Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% scrub (for a skin disorder); and Diclofenac 1% topical gel (for back pain).

VA denied the clothing allowance claims because the Veteran was not service connected for any skin conditions at the time of his application.  See December 30, 2020, Decision Letter.

The Board finds that one or more clothing allowances cannot be awarded for the Veteran's use of the various topical medications during calendar year 2020.  The evidentiary record confirms that the Veteran was not in receipt of service connection for any skin condition during calendar year 2020.  Further, on his claim, the Veteran explicitly stated that the topical medications were needed to treat skin issues and pain related to his service-connected lumbosacral strain with lumbar spine disc disease and arthropathy.  

There is no provision in the law for a clothing allowance based on the use of topical medication for service-connected disabilities other than skin disabilities.  The same was true during calendar year 2020.  

Since the Veteran did not use any of the prescribed topical medications for a skin disability in 2020, the claim must be denied as a matter of law.

Accordingly, annual clothing allowance benefits for the Veteran's use of various topical medications (Triamcinolone Acetonide 0.1% ointment; Tretinoin 0.025% cream; Clindamycin Phosphate 1% topical solution; Chlorhexidine Gluconate 4% scrub; and Diclofenac 1% topical gel) during calendar year 2020 is denied.
