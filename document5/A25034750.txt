ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency medical care services provided on May 16, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The emergency medical care services furnished by the appellant on May 16, 2020, were pursuant to a Veterans Care Agreement (VCA), which is subject to a specific administrative dispute resolution process that does not allow for appellate review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the issue concerning entitlement to payment for the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care services furnished by the appellant on May 16, 2020, have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1703A(d), (h); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4120, 17.4135.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2010 to February 2014.

The appellant is a non-VA medical provider that rendered emergency medical care services to the Veteran on a contract basis through a VCA. See generally 38 C.F.R. 

§§ 17.4100-17.4135.  

In February 2021, a notice of disagreement (NOD) selecting Evidence Submission Reviewed by a Veterans Law Judge was received.

The Board is in receipt of the Veteran's representative's brief indicating that the Veteran incurred costs due to the May 2020 episode of care; however, the Veteran is not the Appellant in this case. Further, there is no indication in the record from the Appellant or the Veteran that shows any costs were incurred by the Veteran. Rather, the Appellant directly billed VA for the cost of the Veteran's care, and as such, there is no claim from the Veteran pending before the Board with regard to this episode of care. 

The evidence shows that the appellant provided emergency medical care services to the Veteran on May 16, 2020. The appellant asserted it was not reimbursed for the cost of services rendered. In July 2021 correspondence, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) indicated that after an initial denial the claim was administratively reviewed and determined to be eligible for payment. See July 2021 Medical Expense Reimbursement. The claim was noted to be in "to be paid" status as of July 22, 2021. See July 2021 Medical Expense Reimbursement.

When VA hospital care, a medical service, or an extended care service required by a covered individual is not feasibly available from a VA facility or through a contract or sharing agreement entered into pursuant to another provision of law, VA may furnish such care or service through a "Veterans Care Agreement" with an eligible non-VA provider. 38?U.S.C. § 1703A(1)(A-B). The term covered individual includes veterans eligible for VA medical services. See 38?U.S.C. § 1703A(f), indicating that a covered individual means any individual eligible for?hospital care,?medical services, or extended care services under Title 38 or any other law administered by VA. 

This controlling statutory authority and an accompanying regulation provide a specific procedure for resolving disputes between VA and a non-VA service provider under a VCA. 38?U.S.C. § 1703A; 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135. The controlling statute, 38?U.S.C. § 1703A, explicitly authorizes VA to "promulgate administrative procedures for eligible entities and providers to present all disputes arising under or related to Veterans Care Agreements" and specifies that "such procedures constitute the eligible entities and providers' exhaustive and exclusive administrative remedies." 38?U.S.C. § 1703A(h)(1-2). The statute also indicates that only after exhaustion of these administrative remedies may the provider or entity seek judicial review and that review may then be sought in Federal District Court or the U.S. Court of Claims in accordance with 28?U.S.C. § 1346 (known as the Tucker Act). 38?U.S.C. § 1703A(h)(3). Additionally, payment by VA under a VCA shall, unless rejected and refunded by the provider within 30 days of receipt, constitute payment in full and extinguishes any liability on the part of the covered individual (e.g., veteran entitled to VA medical services) for the treatment or care provided. 38?U.S.C. § 1703A(e)(2)(B). 

As mandated by the section 1703A statutory authority, the controlling regulation, 38?C.F.R. § 17.4135, "establishes the administrative procedures and requirements for asserting and resolving disputes arising under or related to a [VCA]," including disputes concerning a claim for payment. 38?C.F.R. §?17.4135(a)(1). Under these procedures, a decision by the "responsible [VHA] official" concerning a VCA dispute, including disagreement concerning the amount of VA payment, is the exclusive administrative remedy for a service provider or entity, and a written decision by a designated responsible VA official constitutes VA's final decision on the dispute (in other words a decision that is not subject to any administrative appeal). 38 C.F.R. § 17.4135(a)(3-5), (c)(5). See also 84 Fed Reg. 21668, 21675 (Interim Final Rule), implementing 38?C.F.R. § 17.4135: 

"Paragraph (c)(5) of §?17.4135 will establish that the written decision issued by the responsible VA official constitutes VA's final decision on the dispute. This language serves to clarify that VA maintains no administrative process to appeal such a decision and to emphasize the reality that, under section 1703A(h)(2), this dispute [resolution] process constitutes entities and providers' exhaustive and exclusive administrative remedy." 

In sum, the controlling statute and regulation provide exclusive VCA administrative dispute resolution authority to VHA, the AOJ. Therefore, the Board, as a VA administrative appeals body, does not have the authority to review or resolve VCA disputes. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7101, 1703A(h)(1-2); 38?C.F.R. 

§ 17.4135(a)(3-5), (c)(5), 84 Fed Reg. 21668, 21675. Consequently, the instant appeal seeking payment under a VCA must be dismissed.
