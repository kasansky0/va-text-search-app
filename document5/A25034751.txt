FINDING OF FACT

In November 2024, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active-duty service from January 1979 to January 1983.  This matter is on appeal from July 2020, and May 2021, rating decisions of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal.  Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claims at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims.  This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

The AOJ must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance.  38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1).  In January 2025, VA received an Application for D.I.C., Survivors Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits, which can be interpreted as a request for substitution.  38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(c)(2).  To date, the AOJ has not ruled on that request.  If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. §?20.1302(a).
