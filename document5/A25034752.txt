ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is related to noise exposure during his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1154, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1966 to June 1969.

The June 2024 rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 18, 2024.  A transcript of the December 2024 Board hearing is of record.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or the Veteran's representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  

This combat Veteran contends that he has tinnitus which is related to excessive noise (e.g., gunfire, explosions, helicopters) during his active service. 

The June 2024 VA examination and the December 2024 private opinion letter from the Veteran's private audiologist (which was submitted during an applicable evidentiary window) shows the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus. Moreover, the Veteran's allegations of in-service exposure to excessive noise are consistent with the circumstances, conditions, and hardships of such service and there is no reason to question the Veteran's assertions.  See, e.g., March 1968 Award of Distinguished Flying Cross (documenting the Veteran's heroism under enemy fire).  In-service noise exposure is established.  38 C.F.R. § 1154(b).  Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service. On this question there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes the June 2024 VA examiner's opinion.  However, the VA examiner indicated onset of the Veteran's tinnitus in 1967, during his active service, then provided a rationale that relied on the fact of current hearing loss and the lack of hearing loss or change in hearing during his active service.  The opinion is not entitled to probative value because the examiner does not explain the contradiction between the examiner's apparent belief that the condition had onset in 1967 during service and his opinion that the tinnitus is a symptom of the Veteran's post-service hearing loss.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) ("most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning").

The evidence in favor of the claim includes the December 2024 private opinion letter which indicates that the Veteran's tinnitus is more likely than not related to his active service.  While the opinion contains very little rationale, the fact that the June 2024 VA examination contains indications that the tinnitus had onset in 1967 suggests a plausible basis for the opinion.  Due to the lack of an explicit rationale, the Board assigns this opinion limited probative value in favor of the claim. 

The Board also considered the combat presumption under 38 U.S.C. 1154. The combat presumption does not relieve combat veterans of the need to demonstrate a causal nexus, but may be used to establish that the Veteran "incurred a permanent . . . . disability in service," potentially reducing the proof needed to demonstrate a nexus. See Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2009). As in Reeves, the Veteran asserts that he began experiencing symptoms during his active service and continued experiencing those symptoms afterwards. The Veteran's statements are competent evidence that they have existed since service and there is no evidence that his contentions lack credibility. 

Considering the Veteran's combat service, lay contentions, and the December 2024 opinion, the Board finds that the evidence is in relative equipoise and, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, finds that service connection is warranted for tinnitus.
