ORDER

A total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected prostate cancer, alone, is granted, from April 13, 2022.

Special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted from April 13, 2022.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. From April 13, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer, alone, precluded him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation.

2. From April 13, 2022, the Veteran also had additional disabilities rated at 60 percent or higher.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From April 13, 2022, the criteria for a TDIU, based solely on prostate cancer, are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

2. From April 13, 2022, the criteria for SMC at the housebound rate are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1970 to December 1971.

These matters are before the Board following the appeal of a March 2024 rating decision, which constituted a higher level review (HLR) of a March 2024 rating decision.  

In February 2025, the Veteran timely appealed on a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record prior to March 7, 2024, the date of the rating decision subject to HLR.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301.

TDIU

When a Veteran files a claim for an increased rating, he is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit under any applicable theory, including TDIU.  Here, the Veteran filed an increased rating for his service connected disabilities on April 13, 2022.  Following a July 2022 rating decision, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim and VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability asserting that entitlement to a TDIU due to his service-connected prostate cancer alone was warranted.  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453 (2009) (holding that, in the context of an initial adjudication of a claim of entitlement to service connection or in the context of a claim for an increase "a request for TDIU, whether expressly raised by a veteran or reasonably raised by the record, is not a separate claim for benefits, but rather involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability").  In a February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted entitlement to a TDIU effective June 14, 2023 as a result of the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer but did not address the issue of whether SMC at the housebound rate was warranted.  The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher Level Review as to the effective date and the implicit denial of SMC at the housebound rate.  In a March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ assigned an effective date of April 13, 2022 as to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU, but found that SMC at the housebound rate was not warranted and entitlement to a TDIU was not warranted based on a single disability.  The Veteran timely filed a VA Form 10182 as to issue of whether TDIU due to service-connected prostate cancer alone was warranted and as to the issue of whether SMC at the housebound rate was warranted.

That the Veteran is already in receipt of a TDIU does not necessarily mean that his entitlement to TDIU is moot because a TDIU based on a single service-connected disability alone may result in additional benefits (i.e., special monthly compensation, or SMC), even if a 100 percent combined schedular evaluation is in effect.  See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008); Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2010).  Accordingly, the Board will now address whether entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected prostate cancer alone is warranted.

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  38 C.F.R. §4.16.  A finding of total disability is appropriate, "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation."  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340(a)(1), 4.15.

A TDIU may be assigned, if the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one such disability it is ratable at 60 percent or more, and that if there are two or more such disabilities at least one is ratable at 40 percent or more and the combined rating is 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

For the purpose of one 60 percent disability, or one 40 percent disability in, the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disabilities of one or both upper or lower or one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from a common etiology or a single accident; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system, e.g., orthopedic, digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular-renal, neuropsychiatric; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; or, (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war.  38 C.F.R. §4.16(a).

For a veteran to prevail on a TDIU claim, the record must reflect some factor that takes the claimant's case outside the norm.  The sole fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty finding employment is not enough, since a high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment; the question is whether the claimant is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required for employment, not whether the claimant can find employment.  See Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

Consideration may be given to the veteran's education, training, and special work experience, but not to his age or to impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that applicable regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on VA, not a medical examiner.  Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  The Federal Circuit's decision in Geib governs the adjudication of this appeal.  See Chisem v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374, 375 (1995).  

At the outset, the Board notes that the Veteran was granted a TDIU, effective April 13, 2022, the date of his increased rating claims, in a March 2024 HLR decision.  At that time, the AOJ found that a TDIU was warranted as a result of the Veteran's combined service-connected disabilities of prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, and bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic and femoral nerves.  Nevertheless, the Board notes that, as it currently stands, the Veteran's service-connected type 2 diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, and bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic and femoral nerves constitute a single service-connected disability as they result from a common etiology, rated as combined 70 percent disabling, effective April 13, 2022.  38 U.S.C. § 4.16(a)(2).  Furthermore, the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer is rated as 60 percent disabling effective March 1, 2021, which constitutes one disability ratable at 60 percent or more.  38 U.S.C. § 4.16(a).

Turning to the relevant evidence, in April 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA diabetes mellitus examination.  The VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with type 2 diabetes mellitus with erectile dysfunction and determined that he was prescribed an oral hypoglycemic agent for treatment.  The Veteran did not require regulation of activities and had episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia less than two times per month.  The Veteran had only one episode of hypoglycemic reactions requiring hospitalization in the past 12 months and did not have progressive unintentional weight loss and loss of strength attributable to diabetes mellitus.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus did not impact his ability to work.  

That same month, the Veteran was also afforded a VA diabetic peripheral neuropathy examination.  The Veteran endorsed pain, numbness, and tingling in the bilateral lower extremities, with difficulty with balance and prolonged walking and standing.  The VA examiner determined that the Veteran had mild constant and intermittent pain and moderate paresthesias and numbness in both legs.  He had reduced strength of the lower left leg but normal strength of the right, normal deep tendon reflexes in both legs, and decreased light touch testing of both legs.  The Veteran had decreased sensation in both legs.  The Veteran had no muscle atrophy or trophic changes.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's diabetic neuropathy impacted his ability to work as he lost one week of work in the last twelve months and had difficulty with prolonged standing and walking. 

In April 2022, the Veteran was also afforded a VA male reproductive organs examination.  The Veteran reported worsening urinary frequency and daily incontinence.  The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's voiding dysfunction caused urine leakage that required absorbent material that must be changed less than two times per day, daytime voiding interval less than one hour, and nighttime awakening to void two times.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer did not impact his ability to work.  

In the June 2023 VA Form 21-8940 Application for Increased Compensation based on Unemployability, the Veteran reported that his service-connected prostate cancer prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.  He last worked full-time as a folder operator from 2002 to 2007.  The Veteran reported that as a result of his prostatectomy, he wears adult diapers 24 hours per day due to incontinence.  He stated that he needs to know where bathrooms are located before leaving his home and that he deals with a lot of embarrassment as a result of his diapers leaking.  He stated that he always must carry a change of clothes in case of an accident.  The Veteran further reported that he has difficulty sleeping as a result of his diapers leaking at night.  He argued that he would not be able to function in a work setting because he needs to go to the bathroom constantly, and the fatigue from his sleep difficulty impairs his ability to concentrate and maintain focus. 

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded another VA male reproductive organs examination.  The Veteran endorsed urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency. The VA examiner determined that the Veteran's voiding dysfunction caused urine leakage that required absorbent material that must be changed less two to four per day, daytime voiding interval between two and three hours, and nighttime awakening to void three to four times.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's prostate cancer did not impact his ability to work.  However, the VA examiner also noted that the Veteran had an inability to hold his urine, wore incontinence undergarments during the day, a condom catheter at night, and had limited ability to leave his home for extended periods due to his urinary incontinence. 

The Board finds based upon the above that the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of his prostate cancer, alone.  Given the Veteran's level of education and his level of disability due to his service-connected prostate cancer, the Board finds that the effect of the disability makes it unlikely that the Veteran could secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his educational level and occupational experience.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities affect his ability to obtain and maintain employment.  Nevertheless, the Board also notes that the Veteran's service-connected prostate cancer alone precludes him from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation and his symptoms are sufficiently severe to show that he is unemployable.  The medical evidence shows that he requires use of absorbent materials that need to be changed multiple times a day and that he must carry a change of clothes in case of leakage.  Here, it is unlikely, given the Veteran's work history, that he would find a work environment that would allow him to have multiple work breaks due to changing his undergarments or clothes as a result of the Veteran's urinary frequency or leakage, or otherwise have reduced duties due numerous bathroom interruptions that could affect his ability to complete ordinary occupation tasks.  The Board also finds it unlikely that the Veteran would find a work environment that would place him with a nearby restroom due to his service-connected prostate cancer.  Accordingly, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, as is required by law, the Board finds that the Veteran is unemployable due to the effects of his service-connected prostate cancer alone, and the claim of entitlement to a TDIU due to service-connected prostate cancer alone is granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(a); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

SMC

The Veteran claims that he is entitled to either SMC based on the need for aid and attendance or by reason of being housebound.  In order to demonstrate entitlement to SMC benefits, the Veteran must meet certain criteria to establish his need for regular aid and attendance or his status for housebound benefits.

VA has a "well-established" duty to maximize a claimant's benefits.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008).  This duty to maximize benefits requires VA to assess all of a claimant's disabilities to determine whether any combination of disabilities establishes entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114.  See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008) (finding that SMC "benefits are to be accorded when a veteran becomes eligible without need for a separate claim").

SMC is payable where the veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  This requirement is met when the Veteran is substantially confined as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Subsection 1114(s) requires that a disabled Veteran whose disability level is determined by the ratings schedule must have at least one disability that is rated at 100 percent in order to qualify for the SMC provided by that statute.  Under the law, subsection 1114(s) benefits are not available to a Veteran whose 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which is rated at 100 percent disabling.

In this case, the Veteran has been in receipt of a TDIU effective from April 13, 2022, the date of his increased rating claims, as due to his combined service-connected disabilities of prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, erectile dysfunction, and bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic and femoral nerves.  Nonetheless, as the Board in this decision determines that TDIU is warranted based on the Veteran's prostate cancer, alone, and in light of the decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011) and Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008), the Board must consider the Veteran's entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate.  

For SMC purposes, the Veteran's prostate cancer satisfies the requirement of a "service-connected disability rated as total," due to the TDIU granted herein.  See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 293 (2008).  The Veteran also has additional disabilities rated at 60 percent or higher as early as April 13, 2022.  Thus, in light of the Court's decisions in Bradley and in Buie, entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted, effective April 13, 2022, the effective date of the Veteran's total rating for prostate cancer alone, as granted herein.
