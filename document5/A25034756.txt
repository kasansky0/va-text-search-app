FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) reversed the decision on appeal and administratively approved the claim for payment of expenses for non-VA emergency medical transportation services provided on May 16, 2019.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of expenses for non-VA emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran on May 16, 2019, by Advanced Life Systems, Inc., has been resolved in full by administrative action; thus, the appeal as to this matter is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1998 to January 2002.  The appellant in this appeal is a non-VA emergency medical transportation services provider that provided transportation services to the Veteran on May 16, 2019.  In January 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission docket to review a January 2021 notice letter issued by a VA AOJ that denied payment for the emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran on May 16, 2019.  

The record reflects that the claim for entitlement to payment of expenses for non-VA emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran on May 16, 2019, by Advanced Life Systems, Inc., was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  An August 2021 AOJ notification letter reflects that the claim was reprocessed and paid to the amount of $324.87.

The Board acknowledges that the amount paid for the emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran, as reflected in the August 2021 notice letter, was less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider.  As provided for in the accompanying Explanation of Payment (EOP), however, if the appellant disagreed with the decision regarding payment of the claim, the appellant was given the opportunity to file a separate appeal following the instructions in the EOP.

As the administrative action approving entitlement to the payment of expenses for non-VA emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran on May 16, 2019, constitutes a reversal of the prior denial to pay the claim, with which the appellant had expressed disagreement, the favorable administrative action constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought by the appellant within this appeal.  

Accordingly, there remain no current allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration with the respect to the underlying denial of payment of expenses for the non-VA emergency medical transportation services provided to the Veteran on May 16, 2019.  Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
