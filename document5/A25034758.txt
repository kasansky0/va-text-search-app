ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 25, 2022, for the grant of service connection for lung cancer is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.	In an unappealed September 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted service connection for lung cancer associated with herbicide exposure with a 100 percent rating effective January 25, 2022, and a noncompensable rating effective May 1, 2022. 

2.	In a December 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was granted a 30 percent rating for lung cancer residuals status post lobectomy effective May 1, 2022; the Veteran identified this rating decision in the present appeal, but contends he is not appealing his current 30 percent rating.

3.	The present appeal for an earlier effective date pertaining to the grant of service connection for lung cancer is a freestanding earlier effective date claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board does not have jurisdiction over the freestanding claim seeking an effective date earlier than January 25, 2022, for the award of service connection for lung cancer.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1969 to January 1971, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Army Commendation Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and a Combat Infantry Badge.

Before turning to the merits of this case, a review of the procedural history is instructive.  The Veteran first sought service connection for lung cancer from herbicide agent (i.e., Agent Orange) exposure in May 2017.  A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the Veteran's claim for service connection in a May 2017 rating decision, which became final because the Veteran did not appeal, and no new and material evidence was received by the VA within one year of the notice of the rating decision. 

On January 25, 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, supplemental claim application, seeking readjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for lung cancer from herbicide agent exposure.  The Veteran also submitted new and relevant evidence that included a letter regarding his history of three prior lung cancers, as well as operative reports for related procedures in April 2017 and October 2021.  See January 2022 Letter from L.T., NP; April 12, 2017, and October 8, 2021, Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

In a September 2022 rating decision, the RO granted the Veteran service connection for lung cancer associated with herbicide exposure with a 100 percent evaluation from January 25, 2022, the date of his supplemental claim application, until May 1, 2022, the first month following six months after his October 8, 2021, procedure (i.e., lobectomy).  From May 1, 2022, the RO assigned a noncompensable rating based on the absence of recent malignancy or significant disability residuals, but noted a VA examination would be requested to determine the Veteran's current level of disability and whether a higher evaluation was warranted. 

In a December 2022 rating decision, the RO increased the Veteran's evaluation for lung cancer residuals status post lobectomy to 30 percent, effective May 1, 2022, based on findings from an October 2022 VA Examination for respiratory conditions.  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of the December 2022 rating decision, which addressed the assignment of an initial rating.  Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system, known by the Board as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. 

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 rating decision (i.e., agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision) on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 25, 2022, for the grant of service connection for lung cancer

The Veteran contends that he is not appealing his current 30 percent evaluation for lung cancer residuals status post lobectomy, effective May 1, 2022.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182, NOD; see also June 2024 VA Form 10182, NOD.  

Instead, the Veteran generally contends he is appealing the date of his grant of 100 percent disability, which he argues should have begun in May 2017 with the actual inception of treatment for two tumors found in the upper right lobe of his lung, instead of the 5 months he was granted from January 2022 until May 2022.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182, NOD.

Based on the Veteran's contentions, he is seeking an effective date earlier than January 25, 2022, for the grant of service connection for lung cancer with a 100 percent rating prior to May 1, 2022.  

The Board observes that the Veteran was granted service connection for lung cancer and assigned a 100 percent rating, effective January 25, 2022, in a September 2022 rating decision.  However, in his December 2023 VA Form 10182, NOD, the December 2022 rating decision was identified as the decision on appeal.  As discussed, in October 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA examination, and the December 2022 rating decision solely addresses the grant of a 30 percent rating for his lung cancer residuals status post lobectomy based on that examination.  The decision did not assign, or address, the effective date of service connection. 

Again, the September 2022 rating decision granted service connection for lung cancer and assigned a 100 percent rating, effective January 25, 2022.  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his appellate rights in September 2022, but he did not submit a timely appeal of the assigned effective date, nor select another appropriate administrative review option, within a year of the September 2022 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

In Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299 (2006), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board lacks the authority to review a claim for an earlier effective date when that claim was filed after the effective date has become final, unless there is a valid request for revision of the decision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  In this case, there is no such request.  Furthermore, the December 2023 VA Form 10182, NOD, filed by the Veteran is not timely as to the September 2022 rating decision.  

Pursuant to Rudd, there remains no allegation of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration in the present appeal.  Accordingly, the Board does not have judication to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
