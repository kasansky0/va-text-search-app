ORDER

The appeal as to the claim of entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, to include tarsal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy, is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

Following receipt of the August 14, 2024, VA Form 10182 pertaining to the denial of the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, to include tarsal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy, VA received clear statements from the Veteran dated November 18, 2024, November 26, 2024, and December 6, 2024, that included the Veteran's name, file number, docket number, and a request to withdraw this appeal. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal of entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, to include tarsal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy by the Veteran, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from September 1983 to August 1985.  His service was under honorable conditions. 

The matter is on appeal from an August 2024 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office (RO). 

The Veteran chose to participate in VA's test program "RAMP", the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program.  This decision has been written consistent with the new AMA framework.  The Veteran opted into RAMP on August 14, 2024, and selected the Direct Review Lane.  As explained on the RAMP Opt-In Election Form, the review is based on evidence submitted to VA as of the date of the election, and the Veteran may not submit additional evidence. Thereafter, in subsequent correspondence, the Board accepted the Veteran's appeal and placed it on the Direct Review docket.  Under Direct Review, the Board will consider all evidence of record up to August 14, 2024.  The Board has not considered any evidence received or submitted after the August 2024 RAMP Opt-In Election. 

While the Veteran now wishes to "reinstate" his appeal, § 20.205 does not provide for the ability to rescind a withdrawal.  Nonetheless, § 20.05 specifically states that withdrawal does not preclude filing a new Notice of Disagreement, a request for higher-level review, or a supplemental claim where timely.  38 C.F.R. § 20.05 (c).  The Board notes that following the Veteran's submittal of the withdrawal letter, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim dated November 13, 2024, as to entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder; therefore, he has followed the expressly outlined provision for further seeking service connection for a right foot disorder, as provided in § 20.205 (c).  The RO will adjudicate his supplemental claim of service connection for such in the ordinary course of business; however, as his withdrawal was effective when received by the Board, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.

 

Entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, to include tarsal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran submitted statements dated November 18, 2024, November 26, 2024, and December 6, 2024 (after the date of the appeal presently before the Board), indicating that he is respectfully requesting to withdraw the issues pertaining to his August 14, 2024, Notice of disagreement (entitlement to service connection for a right foot disorder, to include tarsal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy) regarding rating decision dated August 5, 2024. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205(b)(1).  These factors have been met in the present case.
