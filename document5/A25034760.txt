CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to January 5, 2022 for service connection for sleep apnea have not been met. ?38?U.S.C. §?5110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.400; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. 

REASONS AND FBASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Board observes that the Veteran served honorably during multiple periods of active duty in the United States Army.  

In the October 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 5, 2022 for an award of service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) disability, secondary to the service-connected rhinitis disability, is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date of November 7, 2017 for the award of service connection for his obstructive sleep apnea. See VA Form 10182 dated October 24, 2022. 

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increased, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The effective date of an award of disability compensation to a veteran is the day following the date of discharge or release if the application therefor is received within one year from such date of discharge or release. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1).

A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought. See 38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, was considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). As of March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims. In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.

Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

While the VA should broadly interpret submissions from a veteran, it is not required to conjure up claims not specifically raised. Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32 (1998); Talbert v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 352, 356-57 (1995). Further, "a veteran's formal claim is required to identify the sickness, disease, or injuries for which compensation is sought, at least at a high level of generality." See Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

A claimant may continuously pursue a clam or an issue by timely and properly filing one of several review options prescribed in VA regulations.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  

After a review of the Veteran's filing history, the Board concludes that he did not continuously pursue his claim from November 2017.  As such, the date of claim is the January 5, 2022 filing of his supplemental claim. 

The Veteran properly filed an intent to file claim in November 2017 and timely filed a request for service connection for sleep apnea (claimed as "sleep issues") in his February 10, 2018 claim.  The RO denied the claim in the March 19, 2018 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a timely Notice of Disagreement on March 6, 2019.  On March 19, 2020 the RO issued the Statement of the Case.  The cover letter of the Form 9 instructed the Veteran that he must file a Form 9 within 60 days from the date of letter or within one year from the notice of the decision to timely appeal the decision. 

The Veteran filed his Form 9  on June 18, 2020.  The Veteran explained that he had been working with the American Legion but that he could not get "ahold of the office since the virus (COVID-19) hit." 

The VA promptly sent a letter to the Veteran on June 23, 2020 informing him that his Form 9 was considered untimely.  However, the Veteran was also informed that if he did not agree with the decision, he could select a review option (to include a supplemental claim) within one year of the date of the letter. 

On November 23, 2020, the Veteran again filed an intent to file a claim.  In April 2021, the Veteran attempted to file a claim for service connection for his sleep apnea via a VA Form 21-526EZ.   On April 23, 2021, the VA informed the Veteran that to claim service connection for sleep apnea, VA regulations required that he file the request on a proper form. 

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for sleep apnea on January 5, 2022. 

Here, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea was not continuously pursued since November 2017.  First, although the Veteran's Form 9 may have been untimely, the Veteran's claim for good-cause  would have been preserved after the filing of the November 23, 2020 intent to file a claim.  The Veteran had one year from the November 23, 2020 intent to file to file a claim for service-connection for  sleep apnea on the proper form.  The Veteran attempted to file a claim in April 2021 but was informed promptly that the VA Form 21-526EZ was not the proper form.   However, despite this notice, the Veteran did not file the claim on the proper form until January 5, 2022, which was more than one year following the November 2020 intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

As such, as January 5, 2022 is the proper date of claim for service connection for sleep apnea, the claim must be denied.
