ORDER

Service connection for prostate cancer is denied.

A disability rating higher than 10 percent for service-connected left ankle disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The most persuasive evidence is against a finding that prostate cancer had onset in service, it did not manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge, and prostate cancer is not shown to be causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident in service.

2. The Veteran's left?ankle?disability is manifested by no worse than 10 degrees of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion to no worse than 20 degrees.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for prostate cancer have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

2. The criteria for a disability rating greater than?10?percent for a?left?ankle disability have not been met.? 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5107;?38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code?5271.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1978 to June 1981.

This appeal comes from a September 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision.  See VA Form 10182 AMA Notice of Disagreement (Direct Review Lane) received September 2024.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AMA decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.? 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? Service connection means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service, or if preexisting service, was aggravated therein.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).???? 

To establish service connection for a disability, there must be competent evidence of the following: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or "nexus" between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.? Horn v.? Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?231, 236 (2010); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Gutierrez v.? Principi, 19?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2004) (citing Hickson v.? West, 12?Vet. App.?247, 253 (1999)).? In many cases, medical evidence is required to meet the requirement that the evidence be "competent."? However, when a condition may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, the presence of the disorder is not a determination "medical in nature" and is capable of lay observation.? Barr v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?303, 309 (2007).???? 

Service connection for certain chronic diseases may be presumed to have been incurred in service by showing that the disease manifested itself to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service.  38?U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).? Such a chronic disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the period of service.? 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307(a). 

When a chronic disease is shown in service, sufficient to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.? 38?C.F.R. §?3.303 (b).? To be "shown in service," the disease identity must be established, and the diagnosis must not be subject to legitimate question.? Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see also 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b).? There is no "nexus" requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service, so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain post-service manifestations of the chronic disease.? Walker, 708 F.3d at 1336.???? 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits under the laws administered by VA.? VA shall consider all information and medical and lay evidence of record.? Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).? 

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer.

The Veteran contends that prostate cancer is related to his active-duty service, more than 43 years ago.  

The evidence shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.  In the September 2024 rating decision on appeal the AOJ made a favorable finding regarding a current diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Under the AMA, the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect any complaints, history or findings consistent with prostate cancer.

After service, VA treatment records show that the Veteran was diagnosed with malignant neoplasm of prostate in May 2023, more than four decades after service discharge.  

Here, there is no evidence of a malignant neoplasm within one year of separation from the Veteran's period of active duty service.? See 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309.? 

Based on the above, the Board must conclude that prostate cancer did not have its onset during service and has not been continuous since that time.? Owens v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?429, 433 (1995).? In so noting, the Board recognizes that the mere absence of medical records is not dispositive as to the question of continuity; the lay evidence must be considered as well.? See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d at1335.? If, however, it is determined based on reliable evidence, that there was an extended period of time after service without any manifestations of the claimed condition, then that tends to weigh against a finding of a connection between the disability and service.? See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  

Therefore, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran did not have a continued problem with prostate cancer in and since active duty.? See 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(b).?? 

Here, there is no competent medical opinion of record linking the claimed prostate cancer to any aspect of his active duty service, approximately 44 years ago.? The only evidence of record in support of such a nexus is the Veteran's lay opinion.? To the extent the Veteran believes that he has prostate cancer related to service, as a lay person, he has not been shown to have the specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion.? Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The diagnosis and/or etiology prostate cancer requires medical testing and expertise to determine.? Moreover, whether the symptoms the Veteran experienced in service or following service are in any way related to his claimed disorder, is a matter that requires medical expertise to determine.? See Clyburn v. West, 12?Vet. App.?296, 301 (1999).? Thus, the Veteran's assertions regarding the etiology of prostate cancer, initially noted 42 years after active duty service, and said service, are of little probative value.? 

In this regard, it is important for the Veteran to understand that the service and post-service treatment records provide particularly negative evidence against the claim.? 

As noted, aside from his allegations, there is no competent medical evidence that suggests that prostate cancer may be associated with active duty service, which is insufficient to trigger the?duty?to assist.? In such circumstances, there is no?duty?to obtain a medical examination or opinion.? McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 84 (2006); Duenas v. Principi, 18?Vet. App.?512, 519 (2004) (VA is not obligated to provide an examination for a medical nexus opinion where, the supporting evidence of record consists only of a lay statement).? Here, there is sufficient evidence to decide the case.  There is also nothing in this record to indicate an association between this problem and anything the Veteran was exposed to during his military service. 

Given the foregoing, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the claim for service connection for prostate cancer and the claim must be denied.? See 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); Lynch, supra.?? 

Increased Rating

Ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity.? 38?U.S.C. §?1155; 38?C.F.R. §?4.1.? Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.? 38?C.F.R. Part 4.? When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind.? Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991).? Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.? Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.7.? The Board will consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2009).?? 

The assignment of a particular diagnostic code to evaluate a disability is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case."? See Butts v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?532, 538 (1993).? One diagnostic code may be more appropriate than another based on such factors as an individual's relevant medical history, the diagnosis, and demonstrated symptomatology.?? 

Traumatic arthritis shown by x-ray studies is rated based on limitation of motion of the affected joint.? When limitation of motion would be noncompensable under a limitation-of-motion code, but there is at least some limitation of motion, a 10 percent disability rating may be assigned for each major joint so affected.?? 

38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5003 (degenerative arthritis) and 5010 (traumatic arthritis).? Diagnostic Code 5003 states that degenerative arthritis established by x-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate Diagnostic Codes for the specific joint or joints involved. 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.? When, however, the limitation of motion is noncompensable under the appropriate Diagnostic Codes, a rating of 10 percent may be applied to each such major joint or group of minor joints affected by limitation of motion.? The limitation of motion must be objectively confirmed by findings such as swelling, muscle spasm, or satisfactory evidence of painful motion.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003.? In the absence of limitation of motion, x-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joints or two or more minor joint groups, will warrant a rating of 10 percent; in the absence of limitation of motion, x-ray evidence of arthritis involving two or more major joint groups with occasional incapacitating exacerbations will warrant a 20 percent rating.? The above ratings are to be combined, not added under Diagnostic Code 5003.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5003, Note 1.?? 

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability.? Thus, with or without degenerative arthritis, it is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.? 38?C.F.R. §§?4.59; see Burton v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?1, 5 (2011) (holding that the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.59 are not limited to disabilities involving arthritis).?? 

Moreover, when evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities, VA may, in addition to applying the schedular criteria, assign a higher disability rating when the evidence demonstrates functional loss due to limited or excessive movement, pain, weakness, excessive fatigability, or incoordination, to include during flare-ups and with repeated use, if those factors are not considered in the rating criteria.? See 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, 4.45, 4.59; see also DeLuca v. Brown, 8?Vet. App.?202 (1995); Burton, 25?Vet. App.?at 5.? The Court also held in Correia v. McDonald, 28?Vet. App. 158 (2016) that the final sentence of 38?C.F.R. §§?4.59 requires that VA examinations include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.?? 

Nonetheless, a disability rating higher than the minimum compensable rating is not assignable under any diagnostic code relating to range of motion where pain does not cause a compensable functional loss.? Rather, the "pain must affect some aspect of 'the normal working movements of the body' such as 'excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance," as defined in 38?C.F.R. §§?4.40, before a higher rating may be assigned.? See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25?Vet. App.?32, 37 (2011) (noting that while "pain may cause a functional loss, pain itself does not constitute a functional loss," and, is therefore, not grounds for entitlement to a higher disability rating).?? 

Finally, the Board acknowledges that VA examinations must include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint.? 38?C.F.R. §?4.59;?Correia, supra.? The Board has also considered the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court's) holding in?Sharp, addressing?38?C.F.R. §?4.40, which states that a VA examiner must "express an opinion on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability" and the examiner's determination in such regard "should, if feasible, be portrayed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to pain on use or during flare-ups."? In light of these requirements, the Board has carefully considered the VA examination of record and whether it complied with?Correia?and?Sharp.? The Board finds the 2023 and 2024 VA examinations did substantially conform to those requirements. 

2. Entitlement to a rating in higher than?10?percent for a?left?ankle disability.

The Veteran seeks a disability rating higher than 10 percent for his left ankle disability.  

The Veteran's?left?ankle?disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code?5271, for limitation of motion of the?ankle. 

Under Diagnostic Code 5271 marked limitation of ankle motion as less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than?10?degrees?plantar?flexion; moderate limitation of motion is less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar?flexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  

Normal?ankle?motion is dorsiflexion to 20 degrees, and?plantar?flexion to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II. 

On VA ankle examination in September 2023, the examiner diagnosed status post-left ankle fracture with retrocalcaneal bursitis.  The Veteran reported left ankle pain.  He endorsed flare-ups of moderate pain, rated 6/10, three to four times a month which impaired his ability to put weight on the ankle and was painful with walking.  Passive and active range of motion showed left ankle dorsiflexion to 15 degrees and plantar flexion to 40 degrees or greater, further reduced to 10 degrees of dorsiflexion and to 35 of degrees plantar flexion with repeated use over time and flare-ups.  There was pain with weight bearing.  There was moderate tenderness on palpation over the calcaneus.  There was no muscle atrophy.  Moreover, no ankylosis or instability was noted.  The Veteran did not require assistive devices for ambulation.  Occupationally, the condition resulted in no more than up to one week of time lost at work in the preceding 12 months and difficulty standing and walking for extended periods of time.

On VA ankle examination in August 2024, the examiner diagnosed status post-left ankle fracture with retrocalcaneal bursitis.  The Veteran reported daily aching pain in the left ankle with occasional sharp pain, along with a burning sensation that interfered with sleep.  He also reported occasional swelling and pain with prolonged walking and pain with prolonged standing.  He treated his symptoms with ice, heat, and Ibuprofen.  He denied flare-ups.  Passive and active range of motion showed left ankle dorsiflexion to 15 degrees and plantar flexion to 25 degrees or greater, further reduced to 10 degrees dorsiflexion and to 20 degrees plantar flexion with repeated use over time.  There was pain with weight bearing, active and passive range of motion.  There was moderate tenderness with palpation and crepitus.  There was no muscle atrophy. Imaging studies showed degenerative arthritis.  Moreover, no ankylosis or instability was noted.  The Veteran did not require assistive devices for ambulation.  Occupationally, the condition resulted in no more than up to one week of time lost at work in the preceding 12 months and difficulty standing and walking for extended periods of time.

The Board notes that during the period on appeal, the Veteran's treatment records reflect findings consistent with the VA examination reports, and nothing in these records show adverse symptomatology to be worse than what was reported by the above VA examiners. 

Having carefully considered the Veteran's claim, the evidence of record persuasively shows that the Veteran's left ankle has been manifested by no more than moderate disability under the rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 5271.  Even when considering functional limitations due to pain with and without weight bearing and resistance in passive and active range of motion as well as during flare-ups and the other factors identified in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59 as well as the Court's holdings in Correia, Sharp, Mitchell, Burton, and DeLuca, and when considering the appellant's competent reports of his observable adverse symptomatology, his functional losses did not equate to the criteria required for the next higher rating because examination showed left ankle dorsiflexion no worse than 10 degrees and plantar flexion no worse than 20 degrees.  Therefore, as the Veteran's left ankle has not demonstrated less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion at any time during the appeal period, Diagnostic Code 5271 can not serve as the basis for a higher rating. 

The Board has also considered all potentially applicable provisions of the rating schedule, whether or not they have been raised by the Veteran or the record, as required by Schafrath, 1?Vet. App.?589.  However, the Board has found no section that provides a basis upon which to assign increased disability ratings for any period on appeal.  There has been no objective finding of ankylosis of ankle, subastragalar or tarsal joint, malunion of the os calcis or astragalus, instability, or astragalectomy; therefore, Diagnostic Codes 5270, 5272, 5273, and 5274 are not for application.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5270, 5272-5274. 

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran's ankle disability may be better rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5284, which addresses non-specific foot injuries.  However, as noted above, Diagnostic Code 5271 pertains specifically to the disability at issue (limitation on motion in the ankle), and also provides specific guidance as to how symptoms of this disability are to be evaluated.  However, Diagnostic Code 5284 pertains only to "foot injuries," which the Board finds to be less specific and more general.  Indeed, a reasonable reading of the relevant Diagnostic Codes suggests that Diagnostic Code 5284 is more applicable to injuries that may not have been contemplated by other Diagnostic Codes, which is not the case here.  Therefore, because there is a specific Diagnostic Code to evaluate ankle limitation of motion, consideration of Diagnostic Code 5284 for evaluating the disability is not appropriate.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.20.

The Board finds the VA examiners' medical findings highly probative to the issue of the severity of the Veteran's left ankle disability. 

Specifically, the examiner interviewed the Veteran and conducted a physical examination.  Additionally, the examination findings are consistent with other evidence of record, including treatment notes.  To the extent the Veteran claims the ankle disorder is more severe than the currently assigned evaluations reflect, the Board finds that the Veteran as a lay person is competent to report observable symptoms, he experiences through his senses such pain, and such symptoms are contemplated by the respective 10 percent disability rating already assigned.  Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Board finds the medical findings, as provided in the examination reports are more persuasive and outweigh the Veteran's statements in support of his claim for a higher disability rating. 

In sum, the Board finds that disability ratings higher than 10 percent for the left ankle disability is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra. 

Finally, the Board does not find that this case raises a claim for a total disability evaluation based upon individual unemployability (TDIU).  See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 454 (2009).  The Veteran has not contended that he is unemployable in connection with the current appeal, nor has he submitted a VA Form 21-8940.  Consequently, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU has not been raised by the record. Id.
