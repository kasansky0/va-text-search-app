ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been submitted, readjudication of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

1. New evidence received after the August 2012 rating decision denial is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

2. It is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's tinnitus began during his period of active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudicating the claim for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Air Force from April 1994 to December 1994, and again from October 1996 to July 1999.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal and it was not considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board must determine the value of all evidence submitted, including lay and medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  The evaluation of evidence generally involves a three-step inquiry. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence comes from a "competent" source. The Board must then determine if the evidence is credible, or worthy of belief. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 308 (2007). The third step of this inquiry requires the Board to weigh the probative value of the evidence in light of the entirety of the record.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

New and Relevant Evidence

The VA will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidenced is presented or secured. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (d). "Relevant evidence" is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (a)(1).

This is a lower threshold than the requirement of "new and material evidence" which applied to the legacy appeal system in that "material evidence" had to relate to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (a).

In August 2012, the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus was denied on the basis that there was no evidence that the Veteran's tinnitus was incurred during or caused by his active service. A subsequent rating decision in February 2017 denied re-opening the Veteran's claim for service connection. In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim to readjudicate service connection for service connection for tinnitus.

The question in this case is thus whether the Veteran has submitted or VA has otherwise received evidence that was not before the adjudicator in August 2012 that tends to prove or disprove one of the elements of service connection.

In October 2023, the Veteran added a private medical treatment record to the claim's file indicating that the Veteran was had a history of tinnitus. The private medical treatment record is new and relevant evidence that the Veteran's tinnitus may have begun during his period of active service.

New and relevant evidence having been submitted, readjudication of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. That an injury or disease occurred in service is not enough; there must be chronic disability resulting from that injury or disease. In order to prevail on the issue of service connection there must be competent evidence of a current disability; medical evidence, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and competent evidence of a nexus between an in-service injury or disease and the current disability. See Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his current tinnitus was incurred during or caused by his period of active service. 

The Veteran's tinnitus was evaluated in hearing loss and tinnitus VA examination completed in July 2012. At the examination, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus began during his period of active service was he was exposed to a live fire explosion during training. The Veteran is competent to report symptoms observable to a layperson, including the onset of tinnitus. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (2009). The Board finds the Veteran's reports of onset in service and continuity of symptoms to be competent and credible.  

Conversely, the July 2012 examiner determined it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was incurred during or caused by his period of active service. The examiner reasoned that it was more likely that the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by his 13 years of work as an aircraft mechanic following his period of active service. However, the Board finds that the July 2012 examiner's opinion is inadequate for purposes of determining service connection as it does not consider the Veteran's lay statement that his tinnitus began during his period of active service. A medical opinion is inadequate if the examiner's rationale fails to account for pertinent evidence, to include competent lay statements describing symptoms of the disability at issue. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331,1335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (noting that "lay evidence is one type of evidence that must be considered, if submitted, when a veteran's claim seeks disability benefits"). Accordingly, the Board does not afford any probative value to the July 2012 medical opinion.     

The nexus requirement may be satisfied by evidence that a chronic disease, including organic diseases of the nervous system, manifested itself to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  Tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  The Board finds the Veteran's assertion that he has had tinnitus continuously since service to be credible.  Service connection for tinnitus on a presumptive basis is granted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309(a); see also Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).
