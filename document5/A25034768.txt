ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) payable at the housebound rate is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) alone renders her unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment.

2. The Veteran is entitled to a TDIU based on a single disability and has additional service-connected disabilities independently rated as 60 percent or more disabling.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU based on PTSD alone are met effective March 10, 2022. 38 C.F.R. §§3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

2. The criteria for entitlement to SMC payable at the housebound rate are met effective March 10, 2022. 38 U.S.C. §1114; 38 C.F.R. §3.350.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty service from February 2014 to February 2019.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in April 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

On March 10, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File form. See March 2022 Notification Letter. On March 10, 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), and on March 21, 2023 she filed a VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. 

On April 6, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for PTSD, assigning a 50 percent disability rating effective March 10, 2023. Also on that date, the AOJ denied entitlement to a TDIU. On April 9, 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in response to that decision, seeking an earlier effective date for service connection of PTSD. On April 18, 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision in response, granting an increased rating for PTSD from 50 percent to 70 percent, but not addressing the earlier effective date requested. 

On April 18, 2024, the Veteran filed another higher level review request in response to the April 6, 2024 decision seeking a TDIU. On April 24, 2024 the Veteran filed yet another higher level review request of the April 6, 2024 RD, seeking a TDIU. On May 2, 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision in response to the April 18, 2024 higher level review request, denying a TDIU. On May 14, 2024, the Veteran filed a request for higher level review of this decision. On May 15, 2024, the AOJ found new and relevant evidence had been submitted warranting changing the effective date of PTSD to March 10, 2022, thereby making the decision a supplemental claim rating decision. On June 4, 2024, the AOJ issued correspondence to the Veteran explaining that a higher level review rating decision is not subject to higher level review. The Veteran then filed a July 7, 2024 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application, appealing the May 2, 2024 denial of a TDIU. On August 28, 2024, the AOJ responded to this claim by denying a TDIU and denying an increased rating for PTSD. 

In the September 1, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket, appealing the April 6, 2024 denial of entitlement to a TDIU. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 6, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

TDIU

A Veteran need not show 100 percent unemployability to be entitled to a TDIU. Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either: a) one disability that is rated at least 60 percent disabling, or b) two or more disabilities that amount to a combined disability rating of at least 70 percent and one of which is rated at least 40 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal, and which permits the individual to earn a living wage. Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). See also Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000).

Marginal employment is defined as when a Veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, or on a facts-found basis (e.g., when employment is in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop) shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. §4.16(a). Recently, the Court held that the phrase "in a protected environment" means "a lower-income position that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market." LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 113 (2024).

In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court provided principles to guide VA adjudicators in determining whether a veteran could obtain and maintain "substantially gainful employment." 31 Vet. App. 58, 72 (2019). First, the Court noted that "substantially gainful employment" included an economic component-i.e., an occupation earning more than marginal income as determined by the United Stated Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person-as well as a non-economic component-i.e., a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of occupation which produces earnings more than the Federal poverty threshold. Id. at 72-73. 

In making such a determination, particular attention must be given to: (1) the Veteran's history, education, skill, and training; (2) whether the Veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue, including whether the Veteran has limitations concerning lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, grasping, typing, and reaching, as well as auditory and visual limitations; and (3) whether the Veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue, including whether the Veteran has limitations concerning memory, concentration, the ability to adapt to change, the ability to handle work place stress, the ability to get along with coworkers, and the ability to demonstrate reliability and productivity. Id.

Entitlement to a TDIU

From March 10, 2022, the Veteran is service connected for PTSD at a 70 percent rating, for headaches at a 30 percent rating, for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve associated with lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome, facet sclerosis and arthropathy at a 20 percent rating, lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome, facet sclerosis and arthropathy at a 10 percent rating, right and left knee strain at a 10 percent rating, and  noncompensable dry eye syndrome and hemorrhoids. See April 2025 Rating Decision Codesheet. 

The Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable decisions that the Veteran's last day of employment was December 15, 2022, and that she met the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU based on having one disability evaluated at least 60 percent disabling. See August 2024 Rating Decision; 38 CFR § 3.104(c). The remaining inquiry is whether PTSD rendered the Veteran unable to obtain and maintain "substantially gainful employment" for the period on appeal, as she maintains. Ray v. Wilkie 31 Vet. App. 58, 72 (2019). The Veteran contends that she has "been unemployed ... because [the] PTSD is affecting [her] ability to find a job that will not trigger [her] symptoms." See March 2023 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.

Economic component

"A Veteran can establish marginal employment either by demonstrating an income less than the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau or by the facts of [the] particular case." Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 6, 71 (2016) (emphasis in original). After service, the Veteran was employed as a hospital corpsman for two months, as a teacher for two months, as a customer service representative for two months, as an assistant store manager for eight months, and as a medical assistant for six months. See March 2023 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability. She reported having made a total of $15,000 in the year prior. Id. This income did not exceed the 2023 poverty threshold for one person under the age of 65 years old which is $15,480. See 2024 United States Census Bureau Poverty Thresholds. While the AOJ attempted to obtain employment information from the Veteran's prior employers, the record reveals that the requests were not fulfilled. Accordingly, the Board resolves all doubt in favor of the Veteran to find that any employment in which the Veteran has engaged during the appeal period is not more than marginal in nature. See Ray v. Wilkie 31 Vet. App. 58, 72 (2019). As such, The Board finds that the record demonstrates that the economic component is met.

Noneconomic component

The Veteran reports that she attended two years of college and studied project management as well as DevOps.  See VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  Turning to the impact of her service-connected PTSD on her ability to work, the Veteran reports that she suffered a sexual assault during service which caused PTSD, and that the PTSD causes her to be "fearful of leaving her son with others ... fearful her son may be assaulted while she is away." See January 2024 VA Examination Report; March 2024 VA Treatment Record.,. See Id. The Veteran argues that the AOJ's determination that her PTSD is not the cause of her unemployability is "completely untrue," and that she "has intrusive thoughts of someone harming [her] son" and anxiety and depression throughout the day. See July 2024 Buddy/Lay Statement. The Veteran's mentor reports that, "the sexual abuse that [the Veteran] faced in 2016 has taken control of her life in all aspects. She has been unable to form a healthy relationship with men since losing the support and love of her husband after being [assaulted]. She is unable to find a job that meets her needs due to the level of anxiety she has with letting her child out of her sight." See February 2023 Buddy/Lay Statement. The Board finds no compelling evidence to the contrary. As such, the Board finds that the record demonstrates that the noneconomic component is met. 

Based on the evidence of record and the Veteran's argument above, and affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran has been unable to obtain or maintain a substantially gainful occupation as a result of the service-connected PTSD alone, and an award of a TDIU is warranted effective March 10, 2022. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).

Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) 

SMC is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

Subsection 1114(s) requires that a disabled Veteran whose disability level is determined by the ratings schedule must have at least one disability that is rated at 100 percent in order to qualify for the special monthly compensation provided by that statute.  Under the law, subsection 1114(s) benefits are not available to a Veteran whose 100 percent disability rating is based on multiple disabilities, none of which is rated at 100 percent disabling.  A TDIU may satisfy the "rated as total" element of section 1114(s), and the order of the awards is not relevant to the inquiry as to whether any of the disabilities alone would render the Veteran unemployable and thus entitled to a TDIU rating based on that condition alone.  Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2010).

SMC based on housebound status

SMC is awarded at the housebound rate if a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as total and, (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities, is permanently housebound. 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i). In light of VA's "well-established duty" to maximize a claimant's benefits, the Board must address whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a) for any part of the appeal period. See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 38 (1993); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).

The Board has now awarded the Veteran a 100% rating based solely on her service-connected PTSD effective March 10, 2022. As noted above, from March 10, 2022 the Veteran has additional service-connected disabilities that independently have a combined 60 percent rating, as follows: headaches at a 30 percent rating, right and left lower extremity radiculopathy affecting the sciatic nerve associated with lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome, facet sclerosis and arthropathy at a 20 percent rating, lumbosacral strain with intervertebral disc syndrome, facet sclerosis and arthropathy at a 10 percent rating, right and left knee strain at a 10 percent rating, as well as noncompensable dry eye syndrome and hemorrhoids. See April 2025 Rating Decision Codesheet. Accordingly, the Veteran meets the statutory requirements for entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate for the period from March 10, 2022.
