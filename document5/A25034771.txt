REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active naval service from November 1976 to November 1980.?????? 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).????? 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.?Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38?C.F.R. §?20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Board notes that in the May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran appealed the denial of entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer in an August 2023 rating decision and the subsequent November 2023 rating decision. The Board notes that the Veteran was initially denied entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer in the August 2023 rating decision. The Veteran then filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim that was received by VA on August 9, 2023, in which he requested review of the August 2023 denial of entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer. The November 2023 rating decision was issued in response to that request. Proceeding with an appeal of the same issue in two separate rating decisions would be duplicative. Therefore, the Board will consider this an appeal of the November 2023 rating decision only, as that affords the greatest body of evidence for consideration of the Veteran's claim. Further, any error in considering the Veteran's appeal filing to be an appeal of the later in time decision is harmless and nonprejudicial to the Veteran. 

Service Connection - Stomach Cancer

The Veteran has alleged that he has stomach cancer that is etiologically related to his active service. Furthermore, the record raises the theory of secondary service connection as the Veteran is service-connected for duodenal ulcer. 

A review of the record shows that a neither a VA examination nor medical opinion were obtained in the development of the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for stomach cancer. In light of the Veteran's diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and the fact that the Veteran is service-connected for a stomach condition, the Board finds that a medical opinion should have been obtained to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed stomach cancer. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). Failure to obtain such evidence constitutes a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal. As such, remand is required for corrective action. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an examiner with appropriate expertise to determine the nature and etiology of the claimed stomach cancer. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated tests and studies must be performed. 

Based on the examination results and review of the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the claimed stomach cancer was caused by, aggravated by, or would not have occurred but for the service-connected duodenal ulcer. 

A complete and detailed rationale for all opinions expressed must be provided.
