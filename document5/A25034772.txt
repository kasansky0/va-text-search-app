REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1984 to August 1992.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country. 

In Encarnacion v. McDonough, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) addressed how the Board must proceed with appeals of Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions that were issued to implement Board decisions.  Encarnacion v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 194 (2023).  First, the Court stated that 38 U.S.C. § 7104 provides that the Board's jurisdiction is wholly derivate of the Secretary's and that it establishes that "[a]ll questions in a matter under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary," and "[f]inal decisions on such appeals shall be made by the Board."  Id.  The Court noted that, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 511(a), a Board decision is deemed the "final and conclusive" determination of the Secretary as to any discrete issue decided in that decision.  Id.  The Court then determined that a "pure" implementation of a Board decision cannot be regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) and such decisions are not appealable to the Board; specifically, the Court referred to such implementations as purely ministerial in nature, as opposed to decisions capable of being appealed through the filing of a Notice of Disagreement.  Id.

In a March 15, 2024, Decision, the Board, in pertinent part: granted an increased rating of 70 percent for MDD effective March 18, 2019; granted a TDIU effective March 18, 2019; and granted 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 DEA benefits effective March 18, 2019.  In a March 19, 2024, Rating Decision (implementing the March 15, 2024, Board Decision), the AOJ: granted an earlier effective date for service connection for MDD effective March 18, 2019; granted an earlier effective date for the grant of TDIU effective March 18, 2019; and granted an earlier effective date for the grant of DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 effective March 18, 2019.  On May 1, 2024, VA received a VA Form 10182 electing the Board's review of the March 19, 2024, Rating Decision under its Direct Review Docket pursuant to the modernized review system under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. §?20.301.  Additionally, on February 4, 2025, VA received a VA Form 10182 electing the Board's review of the March 19, 2024, Rating Decision under its Hearing Request Docket pursuant to the modernized review system under the AMA.  38?C.F.R. §?20.301.   

Initially, the Board considered whether the Veteran's subsequent submission of the February 4, 2025, VA Form 10182 equated to a request to change dockets (from the Direct Review Docket elected in the May 1, 2024, VA Form 10182 to the Hearing Request Docket elected in the February 4, 2025, VA Form 10182).  Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  However, after carefully analyzing the appeal's procedural history, the Board has concluded that it was improperly docketed.  Specifically, the March 19, 2024, Rating Decision was a purely ministerial implementation of the March 15, 2024, Board Decision; accordingly, the March 19, 2024, Rating Decision is not regarded as a decision affecting the provision of benefits under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a) and was not appealable to the Board.  Encarnacion, supra.  Although a May 13, 2024, Docketing Letter informed the Veteran that his appeal had been placed on the Direct Review Docket, the Board finds the appeal to be improperly docketed in the AMA system for the reasons discussed above.

However, the Court in Encarnacion held that the Board must determine whether an attempt to appeal an AOJ decision that implements a Board decision constitutes a timely motion for reconsideration of the underlying Board decision.  Encarnacion, supra.  Regulations state that a motion for reconsideration must be in writing and must include: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the applicable VA file number; and the date of the Board decision to be reconsidered.  38 U.S.C. § 7103; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002.  A motion for reconsideration must also clearly and specifically set forth the alleged obvious error, or errors, of fact or law in the applicable Board decision or other appropriate basis for requesting reconsideration.  If the applicable Board decision involved more than one issue on appeal, the motion for reconsideration must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the motion pertains; issues not so identified will not be considered in the disposition of the motion.  Id.  

Considering the May 1, 2024, and February 4, 2025, VA Form 10182s, the Board finds that the Veteran clearly and specifically set forth his basis for requesting reconsideration of the March 15, 2024, Board Decision regarding the issues herein; thus, the Board has construed the 10182s herein as a motion for reconsideration of the March 15, 2024, Board Decision and the Board will issue a separate decision adjudicating that matter at a later time.  38 U.S.C. § 7103; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1002.  However, because the March 19, 2024, Rating Decision was not appealable to the Board, the Board must dismiss this appeal due to procedural defect insofar as it was?improperly docketed?in the AMA system.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(a), 7105(d); Encarnacion, supra; Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).
