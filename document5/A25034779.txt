DOCKET NO. 210624-168029
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

As good cause has been shown for delay, an October 2020 VA Form 9 (substantive appeal) is considered timely filed regarding a March 2020 statement of the case (SOC), reinstatement of the underlying legacy appeal is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

While October VA Form 9 was not timely as to a March 2020 SOC, the Veteran has shown good cause for the delay.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a timely filed VA Form 9 as to the March 2020 SOC have been met. 38U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.22, 19.52.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1982 to January 2002.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in May 2021 issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In her June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Evidence Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal and any evidence submitted within 90 days of the VA Form 10182.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Timeliness of Appeal

Under VA regulations, a legacy appeal consists of a timely filed written notice of disagreement and, after a statement of the case (SOC) has been furnished, a timely filed substantive appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 19.20. A substantive appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 9, Appeal to Board, or correspondence containing the necessary information. 38 C.F.R. § 19.22. Proper completion and filing of a substantive appeal are the last actions an appellant need to take to perfect an appeal. Id. The necessary information consists of specific arguments relating to errors of facts or law made by the AOJ in reaching the determination being appealed, and the arguments made are to be construed liberally. Id.

The substantive appeal must be filed within 60 days from the date the RO mailed a claimant the SOC or within the remainder of the one-year period from the date of mailing of the rating decision being appealed, whichever period ends later. 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.51, 19.52. Otherwise, the rating decision becomes final. See 38 C.F.R. §20.1103. The date of mailing of the SOC will be presumed to be the same as the date of the SOC, and the date of mailing the letter of notification of the determination will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.30, 19.52.

The time to appeal a VA decision does not commence, and the VA decision will not become final, if a veteran is not notified of the decision and her appellate rights. See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 241(2007); Hauck v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1994).  Moreover, the filing of a timely substantive appeal, as opposed to a notice of disagreement, is not a jurisdictional bar to the Board's jurisdiction. Therefore, the Board can implicitly or explicitly waive the issue of timeliness about a substantive appeal. Nonetheless, the Board may decline to exercise jurisdiction over an appeal, if a substantive appeal was not timely filed. See Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45(2009).

A "presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties. Ashley v. Derwinski,2 Vet. App. 62, 64 (1992) (quoting United States v. Chem. Found., Inc. ,272 U.S. 1, 1415, 47 S. Ct. 1, 71 L. Ed. 131(1926))." Fithian v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 146, 150 (2010); see also Mindenhall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 271 (1994) (applying this presumption of regularity to procedures at the RO).

Once the presumption attaches to a particular VA action, the claimant attacking the presumption bears the burden of showing by "clear evidence" that regular, proper procedures were not followed. See Parks v. Shinseki, 716 F.3d 581, 584 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Butler v. Principi, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001); see also Hilkert v. West, 12 Vet. App. 145, 151(1999) (en banc) (holding that an appellant bears burden of demonstrating error on appeal).  This includes the mailing process. See Romero v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 84 (2020). 

The Board has jurisdiction over appeals of questions of law and fact that involve entitlement to VA benefits, as well as to resolve questions of its own jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.103, 20.104. The decision as to the timeliness and adequacy of a substantive appeal will be made by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7108; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104 (c), (d).

1. Whether the March 2020 SOC was timely appealed

The Veteran contends that she was unable to appeal a March 2020 SOC because she did not receive it until September 2020, and that her October 2020 VA Form-9 should be considered timely.  After a thorough and sympathetic review, the Board has found that that the Veteran has shown good cause as to why her VA Form 9 was late, and that the 60-day time limit to submit this document should be waived.  

By way of history, in a July 2017 rating decision, the RO continued the denial of the issues on appeal including service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement to this decision and, on March 26, 2020, the RO issued and mailed a SOC to the Veteran's address of record as well as to the Veteran's representative, on that same day.  While the SOC notified the Veteran that she had sixty days from the date of the SOC to file a substantive appeal and included a blank VA Form 9, the Veteran did not submit her VA Form-9 until October 2020, and over six months after the SOC was sent. 

In essence, the Veteran is asking for a waiver of the timeliness because she nor her attorney representative received the SOC.  It is true that short of clear evidence to the contrary, the presumption of regularity applies, and it is assumed that the Veteran and representative received the mailed SOC.  See Romero v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 84 (2020).  However, the Board finds that the statements from the Veteran and the attorney representative are credible.  

Moreover, as noted above, the Board emphasizes that a substantive appeal is not a jurisdictional requirement, and VA may waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a substantive appeal, either explicitly or implicitly, where appropriate. Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37 (2009). Here, it would be unnecessarily prejudicial to deny the Veteran her right to appeal when it appears that all parties involved made a good faith effort to follow VA administrative rules.  

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's VA Form 9 was timely filed, and the issues on appeal may be reviewed.
