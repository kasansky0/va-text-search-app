ORDER  

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT  

Resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's current tinnitus at least as likely as not started during and continued since active service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW  

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 2016 to October 2020.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in March 2023.  In a March 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the March 2023 rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

1. Entitlement to Service Connection for Tinnitus  

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

For chronic diseases shown in service, the second and third elements of service connection may be established through demonstrating chronicity or continuity of symptomatology in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  Tinnitus is a chronic disease.  See Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271 (2015) (section 3.309(a) "includes tinnitus, at a minimum where there is evidence of acoustic trauma, as an 'organic disease[s] of the nervous system'").  

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

A December 2022 VA hearing loss and tinnitus examination reflects a diagnosis of tinnitus.  In addition, the Veteran reported constant high pitched sounds in both ears that had worsened since onset during active service in 2020.  The AOJ previously found noise exposure during service, see 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c), and the Veteran's lay reports are sufficient to establish current tinnitus, as well as continuity of symptomatology since service.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002).  

The Board acknowledges the December 2022 VA examiner's opinion, that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by or a result of military noise exposure, however, the Veteran reported constant tinnitus and onset while on active duty to that same examiner.  While one February 2023 VA examiner concluded tinnitus did not result from certain exposures, yet another offered a favorable opinion premised on accepting the Veteran's same reports.  

Those lay reports are consistent with other evidence submitted on the Veteran's behalf.  See e.g., December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ ("during my active duty service"); December 2022 Lay Statement (recounting observing the Veteran complain of ears ringing during service).  

The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus started in service and has continued since.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  The claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.
