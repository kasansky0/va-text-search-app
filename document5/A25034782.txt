An effective date of March 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 (DEA) benefits is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The October 2008 and June 2009 rating decisions denied service connection for acquired psychiatric disorders.  The Veteran did not appeal the June 2009 rating decision and did not submit new and material evidence within one year of the notice of the decision. 

2. The next communication indicating intent to file a claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, namely PTSD, was received on March 2, 2020, and the Veteran continuously pursued this claim until the December 2022 rating decision issued under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) granted service connection for PTSD. 

3. The Veteran became permanently and totally disabled for purposes of DEA benefits effective March 2, 2020. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The October 2008 and June 2009 rating decisions denying service connection for acquired psychiatric disorders are final.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.156, 3.400, 19.20.

2. The criteria for an effective date of March 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.156, 3.303, 3.400, 3.2500. 

3. The criteria for an effective date of March 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the award of DEA benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1981 to April 1999. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (the Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decision.  The rating decision denied an effective date earlier than June 8, 2020, for the grant of service connection for PTSD with alcohol and opioid use disorder. 

By way of history, a December 2022 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD with alcohol and opioid use disorder with an initial 100 percent disability rating from June 8, 2020.  The rating decision also granted eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status from the same date.  

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the December 2022 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2022 decision.  

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 8, 2020, for the grant of service connection for PTSD.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 8, 2020, for the grant of basic eligibility for DEA benefits.

The Veteran contends that March 2, 2020, should be assigned as the effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD, as that is the date the Veteran submitted his intent to file. 

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a), the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), is applicable to all claims or requests for reopening finally decided claims for which VA issues notice of a decision on or after the effective date of the AMA. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(a).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a new supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(1) within one year of the prior denial. Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental claim or a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500(c)(2) within one year of the higher-level review decision.

By way of history, the Veteran filed his original claim for service connection for a PTSD in February 2007. An October 2008 rating decision denied the claim. The Veteran submitted additional evidence following the denial.  

In a June 2009 rating decision, the previous denial was confirmed and continued. The Veteran was notified of the decision and his appeal rights in June 2009. As the Veteran did not submit new and materia evidence within one year of the June 2009 rating decision, and did not appeal the decision, the October 2008 and June 2009 rating decisions became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

Next, on March 2, 2020, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for PTSD.  On March 3, 2020, the RO sent notification that his claim was received and that no action was needed at this time.  On March 13, 2020, the RO sent notice that the Veteran's claim is being worked on, but that more information was need regarding the Veteran's in-service incident.  

Then, on April 23, 2020, the RO sent the Veteran correspondence that his claim must be completed on a proper form, as the Veteran used a legacy system of review claim and not AMA.  The Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim for service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder on June 8, 2020, the date that was subsequently assigned by the RO as the effective date for grant of service connection for PTSD. 

In this light, an effective date of March 2, 2020, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is warranted.  Here, the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection for PTSD on March 2, 2020.  He was twice notified that his claim was being processed.  Although the claim was not received on the correct form initially, the Veteran continuously pursued the March 2, 2020, claim by submitting the correct form immediately following the notice.  Moreover, as noted above, the RO initially confirmed the Mach 2, 2020, as a complete claim, and told the Veteran that nothing further was needed from him.  It is unclear why the RO took several actions in developing the claim prior to obtaining the correct supplemental claim form from the Veteran.  

Thus, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, March 2, 2020, is the date of the claim following the last final denial.  Notably, there is no other correspondence or claims, formal or informal, that were submitted following the June 2009 final rating decision and prior to the March 2, 2020, claim. 

Next, the record indicates that prior to March 2, 2020, the Veteran was diagnosed with the claimed disability.  As such, the date of the claim is the latter between the date entitlement arose and the date of the claim.  Accordingly, the date of the claim, and in this case March 2, 2020, is the earliest possible effective date of service connection for PTSD. 

In sum, the June 2009 rating decision denying service connection was the last final denial issued under the legacy system of appeals.  The rating decision was not appealed, and no new and material evidence was submitted within one year of the decision.  The June 2009 rating decision became final, and the next correspondence that was received from the Veteran was the March 2, 2020, claim for service connection for PTSD.  As the Veteran was already diagnosed with the claimed disability prior to the filing of the March 2, 2020, claim, the date of the claim following the last final denial, is the latter between the date of the claim and the date entitlement arose.  As such, an effective date of March 2, 2020, and no earlier, is warranted for the grant of service connection for PTSD.   

Next, the effective date for basic eligibility for DEA benefits is directly related to a finding that the Veteran has a total disability that is permanent in nature. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807. The Veteran's 100 percent disability rating for PTSD satisfies the requirement for a permanent and total disability.  As the instant Board decision found that the Veteran was entitled to an effective date of March 2, 2020, for the grant of service connection for PTSD, and as the Veteran has already been granted an initial 100 percent disability rating for PTSD, that same effective date will be assigned for the Veteran's grant of Chapter 35 benefits as this is the date the Veteran first met the eligibility requirement of a permanent and total disability. Accordingly, entitlement to an earlier effective date of March 2, 2020, but no earlier, for DEA benefits is granted.
