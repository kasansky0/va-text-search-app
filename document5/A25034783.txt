ORDER

The issue of initial eligibility and any accrued benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. At the time of the Veteran's death, no benefits had accrued that can be awarded to the Appellant in this case.

2. Due to the death of the Veteran, final approval and designation for PCAFC benefits is unachievable as both the Veteran and the Primary Family Caregiver applicant are precluded from completing and complying with all applicable requirements of the program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the appeal for eligibility of PCAFC benefits must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1720G, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 71.10-71.60.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from October 1983 to December 1990.  His decorations included a Navy Expeditionary Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in December 2023 and the Appellant is his surviving spouse and co-applicant for benefits under PCAFC.

As an initial matter, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran's wife for her dedication in the care of the Veteran.  

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran and Caregiver-Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), here the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The issue of eligibility for benefits under PCAFC.

The Veteran and Primary Caregiver-Appellant (wife) applied jointly for participation in PCAFC in January 2021.  The Veteran died in December 2023, while the appeal was pending and prior to final approval of participation in the PCAFC.  The Appellant contends that entitlement to benefits is warranted for the period of care prior to the Veteran's death, specifically from October 1, 2022, through December 25, 2023.  See Appellate Brief, March 2024.

Unfortunately, due to the death of the Veteran, the Board must deny this appeal as a matter of law.

The PCAFC differs from many other benefits available to veterans and their families through the VA.  As discussed below, one difference is that final approval and participation in the PCAFC is dependent on a series of steps that include legal and medical determinations, as well as practical steps such as in-home evaluations, before a Caregiver receives final approval and benefits under the program.  Further, continued participation in the program is dependent on periodic recertification.  Because the Veteran died before completion of all of these steps required for participation in the PCAFC, at the time of his death he was not an eligible veteran as defined under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 and no monetary benefits were due at that time.  As such, no benefits had been accrued at the time of the Veteran's death to pay to the Appellant.

PCAFC is a VA program that provides certain benefits to eligible veterans who have incurred or aggravated serious injuries during military service, and to their caregivers.  38 C.F.R. § 71.10(a).  An "eligible veteran" means a veteran, or a servicemember, who is found eligible for a Family Caregiver under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20.  38 C.F.R. § 71.15.  A "Primary Family Caregiver" means an individual who meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 71.25.  Id. 

The application requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25 require that, before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must: (1) be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training, and (2) complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements.  See 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(c).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 71.25(f), final approval and designation for the Caregiver Program benefits will be conditioned on the Veteran and Caregiver "remaining eligible" for Caregiver Program benefits, including the Caregiver continuing to provide caregiver services to the Veteran and continuing compliance with all applicable requirements.

Here, the AOJ did not find the Veteran eligible for PCAFC benefits under 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 prior to his death.  See January 2021 Denial Notification Letter.  Final approval and designation did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, so periodic monthly PCAFC benefits had not been established.

In this case, final approval and designation of the PCAFC benefits did not occur by the time of the Veteran's death, the joint application was not processed, and the applicants were not enrolled in PCAFC.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 1375 (January 9, 2015) (Family Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home (whichever is later), but these benefits are not provided until a Family Caregiver has been designated.  Family Caregivers must complete all required training and instruction to become so designated).

Approval for PCAFC and designation of a Primary Family Caregiver are precluded as a matter of law because the eligible Veteran and Family Caregiver are no longer eligible for benefits.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (holding that, where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of the lack of legal merit or the lack of entitlement under the law).  The Veteran's death precludes initial eligibility.

The Board is mindful that the notification letter sent in this case is not entirely compliant with 38 U.S.C. § 5104 and that a remand may provide additional medical and procedural documents in the claim.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1720(G)(12).  However, the January 2021 denial letter is part of the record and sufficient other documentation to verify that the Appellant's PCAFC claim was not finally approved prior to the Veteran's death.  As such, there is no basis upon which to award the benefit sought in this case as a matter of law.  Hence, any error is nonprejudicial, and remand for correction of these errors would not have any reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a)(3).

The Board offers its sincere condolences to the Veteran's family and is grateful for his honorable service; however, the Board is bound by law, and its decision is dictated by the relevant statutes and regulations. 

Under these circumstances, there is no potential avenue by which the eligibility requirements for PCAFC benefits could be granted.  Therefore, this appeal must be denied as a matter of law.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

The appeal is denied.
