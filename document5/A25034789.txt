ORDER

The reduction in rating for degenerative disc disease, lumbosacral strain, intervertebral disc syndrome, spinal stenosis, and residuals of laminotomy (back disability) from 40 percent to 20 percent was proper, and restoration of the 40 percent rating effective November 17, 2023, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

An April 2024 rating decision reduced the rating for the Veteran's back disability from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective November 17, 2023; the rating decision did not reduce the overall disability rating; as of November 17, 2023, the 40 percent rating for the back disability had been in effect for less than five years and the reduction did not affect the Veteran's overall disability rating; at the time the rating reduction was effectuated, the evidence demonstrated actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The rating reduction from 40 percent to 20 percent for the Veteran's back disability, effective November 17, 2023, was proper; thus, the restoration of a rating higher than 20 percent is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (Code) 5243.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1971 to May 1974 and from June 1974 to June 1978.

This matter is before the Board on appeal from an April 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) rating decision.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Reduction and Restoration 

For the rating period on appeal from November 17, 2023, the Veteran's back disability has been rated 20 percent under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5243.  

The VA Rating Schedule provides for the following ratings for spine disabilities, with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease.  

According to the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (General Formula), the following ratings are to be assigned: [The ratings listed below apply to Codes 5235 through 5243 (unless a disability rated under Code 5243 is alternatively rated under the "Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes").]  

Under the General Formula, a 20 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is to 60 degrees or less; or combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is not greater than 120 degrees; or, with muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted when forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is limited to 30 degrees or less; or, for favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine; and a 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ reduced the 40 percent rating for the service-connected back disability to 20 percent, effective November 27, 2023.  Because the reduction accomplished in the April 2024 rating decision did not affect the Veteran's overall disability rating, the due process protections of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) are not applicable.

At the time that the rating reduction became effective, November 17, 2023, the 40 percent rating for the back disability had been continuously in effect for less than five years.  A rating reduction is not proper unless the disability shows actual improvement in the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of the applicable rating criteria.  Prior to the rating reduction, as shown on a December 2022 VA examination, the back disability manifested in forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 25 degrees, meeting the criteria for a 40 percent rating.  At the time of the rating reduction, the back disability manifested in forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine limited to 60 degrees, warranting not more than a 20 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5243.

Historically, in a February 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for the back disability and rated the disability at 40 percent from November 2, 2021.  

In this case, the weight of the evidence showed actual improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work at the time of the reduction; therefore, the criteria for restoration of a 40 percent rating for the back disability, effective from November 17, 2023, have not been met.  At the time of the rating reduction decision in April 2024, the back disability manifested in less severe symptomatology.  According to the November 17, 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported pain in the lower back on both sides radiating to his legs.  He reported having flare-ups of the back occurring all throughout the day, lasting 30 minutes or so.  On physical exam of the thoracolumbar spine, forward flexion was to 60 degrees, and extension, right and left lateral flexion, and right and left lateral rotation were each to 20 degrees.  There was no objective evidence of crepitus or of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the back.  There was no additional loss of function or range after repetitive use testing.  The evidence did not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time.  The evidence suggested that pain significantly limited functional ability with flare-ups, though the estimated ranges of motion were unchanged from active range of motion testing.  There was no localized tenderness, guarding, or muscle spasm of the thoracolumbar spine, no muscle atrophy, no ankylosis, and no other neurologic abnormalities or findings.  The Veteran did not have episodes of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome of the thoracolumbar spine that required bed rest prescribed by a physician or treatment by a physician in the previous 12 months.  The disability picture, as shown by the VA examination findings and VA treatment records, indicates that the underlying disability has shown improvement.

Based on the foregoing, the weight of the evidence of record in this case shows actual improvement in the service-connected back disability at the time of the April 2024 rating reduction, specifically, improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  For these reasons, the Board finds that the reduction of the 40 percent rating to a 20 percent rating under Code 5243 effective from November 17, 2023, was proper; therefore, restoration of the 40 percent disability rating under Code 5243 is not warranted.
