ORDER

The appeal for restoration of a 70 percent rating for anemia is granted; the 70 percent rating is restored, effective July 1, 2022.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 70 percent for anemia is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 60 percent for diabetes mellitus is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) on the basis of a single service-connected disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's anemia improved such that there is an improvement in her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

2. The Veteran is in receipt of a rating for anemia that is higher than what new rating criteria currently permit.

3. The Veteran's diabetes mellitus resulted in less than three hospitalizations for episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia and she saw her diabetic care provider for such episodes less than twice monthly. She did not have complications of diabetes.

4. Neither the Veteran's hirsutism, diabetes mellitus, bilateral eye lattice degeneration, or anemia alone prevented her from securing or maintaining substantially gainful occupation.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for restoration of a 70 percent rating for anemia, effective July 1, 2022, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344 (2024).

2. The criteria for entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 70 percent for anemia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.117, Diagnostic Code (Code) 7720 (2024).

3. The criteria for entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 60 percent for diabetes mellitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7, 4.119, Code 7913 (2024).

4. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU on the basis of a single service-connected disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.3, 4.16 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1997 to December 2005.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2021, April 2022, and November 2022 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, for the issue related to the Veteran's diabetes, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. For the issues related to the Veteran's anemia, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. For the issue related to a TDIU, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal, as applicable, cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Veteran called VA to withdraw her appeal. See July 2024 Report of General Information. This withdrawal is not valid because it is not in writing. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. The Board attempted to seek clarification regarding her intent to withdraw but did not receive a response. See January 2025 correspondence. As a result, the Board must proceed with adjudication.

Due to the Board's grant herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a combined disability rating of 100 percent during the entire review period. Thus, entitlement to a TDIU is moot, except in the context of whether it can be assigned based on a single service-connected disability such that entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate may be assigned. See Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 291-293 (2008). The Board has recharacterized the issue accordingly.

1. Whether the reduction of a 70 percent rating for anemia, effective July 1, 2022, was proper.

For reductions, 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) requires the AOJ to issue a rating decision proposing the reduction and setting forth all material facts and reasons, notify the beneficiary of the contemplated action and furnish detailed reasons therefore, and allow 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that payments should continue at the present level. If a reduction is found to be warranted upon consideration of any additional evidence submitted, final rating action will be taken, and compensation will be reduced effective the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice of the final action expires. See Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007); VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 7, 1991).

In a rating reduction case, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21 (1993); Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).

In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence of record available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether the condition has demonstrated actual improvement. Cf. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 281-82 (1992). 

As an initial matter, the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) have been met. In December 2021, the AOJ notified the Veteran of the proposed reduction, and such notice was adequate.

Notably, although the AOJ originally proposed to reduce the rating for anemia on the basis of clear and unmistakable error, see December 2021 rating decision, the reduction was ultimately on the basis that an October 2021 VA examination reflected that the condition was readily reducible. The Board will proceed accordingly.

During a November 2018 VA examination, the Veteran reported that her condition began with always being cold, and that her symptoms had stayed the same. The examiner noted that the Veteran's symptoms included weakness, easy fatigability, light-headedness, and dyspnea on mild exertion. Her hemoglobin level was 8.3L. The examiner opined that the Veteran's condition had no impact on her ability to work.

In July 2021, the Veteran went to a private hospital and underwent a blood transfusion due, at least in part, to her anemia. See July 2021 private treatment records.

During an October 2021 VA examination, the Veteran reported that her current symptoms included low energy and shortness of breath with exertion, such as when walking or climbing stairs. The examiner noted the Veteran's transfusion in July 2021 and also noted that the Veteran required continuous treatment with oral supplementation. Her hemoglobin level was 9.7L. The examiner opined that the Veteran's anemia impacted her ability to work due to fatigue and shortness of breath, which made it difficult to accomplish tasks.

After consideration of the evidence of record, the evidence does not reflect that there was an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. The only improvement in the Veteran's condition is that her hemoglobin level improved in October 2021. However, overall, the Veteran's condition appears to have stayed the same or even worsened. Indeed, she underwent a blood transfusion, which is an escalation of treatment. Moreover, the October 2021 VA examiner's opinion regarding the impact on the Veteran's ability to work reflects greater impairment than during the prior VA examination. As a result, the requirements for a reduction have not been met and the Veteran's rating is restored.

The Board notes that the rating criteria for anemia changed on December 9, 2018. See 83 Fed. Reg. 54254 (Oct. 29, 2018). However, a readjustment to the Schedule for Rating Disabilities cannot be the grounds for a reduction of a disability in effect on the date of the readjustment unless the medical evidence establishes that the disability actually improved. 38 C.F.R. § 3.951(a). For the reasons discussed above, such improvement has not been demonstrated.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular Code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, including degree of disability, is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

In any claim for an increased rating, "staged" ratings may be warranted where the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 70 percent for anemia.

The Veteran's anemia was originally rated pursuant to Code 7700, which was for anemia, hypochromic-microcytic and megaloblastic, such as iron-deficiency and pernicious anemia. Under that Code, the rating criteria allowed for a rating of 70 percent and 100 percent to be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.117 (2018).

As discussed above, the rating criteria for anemia changed, effective December 9, 2018. Code 7700 was removed. Iron deficiency anemia is now rated pursuant to Code 7720. The maximum rating allowed pursuant to Code 7720 is 30 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.117 (2024). As the Veteran is in receipt of a rating in excess of the current maximum criteria, a rating in excess of 70 percent must be denied.

2. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 60 percent for diabetes mellitus.

The Veteran's diabetes mellitus is rated pursuant to Code 7913. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.119. Code 7913 provides a structured scheme of specific, successive, cumulative criteria. Each higher rating includes the same criteria as the lower rating plus distinct new criteria. Middleton v. Shinseki, 727 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A 60 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated. A 100 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities, with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119. 

Regulation of activities means the avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities. Id., Code 7913. VA will concede that an individual's diabetes mellitus requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities when the diabetes has caused episodes of ketoacidosis that have resulted in hospitalization. Veterans Adjudication Procedure Manual (M21-1) V.iii.11.1.e.

Compensable complications of diabetes are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100-percent evaluation. Noncompensable complications of diabetes are considered part of the diabetic process. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Code 7913 (Note 1).

Because Code 7913 contains successive criteria, the criteria for the lower rating must be met before a higher disability rating may be awarded. A higher rating cannot be granted based on a finding that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. However, reasonable doubt regarding the presence of a criterion may be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).

During an August 2020 VA diabetes examination, prior to the beginning of the review period for this matter, the examiner found that the Veteran did not require regulation of activities. She would visit her diabetic care provider for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia less than two times per month. She did not have episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring hospitalization. She did not have progressive unintentional weight loss and loss of strength. The only complication of diabetes was diabetic retinopathy. However, an August 2020 VA eye examiner found that the Veteran did not have diabetic retinopathy. 

During an October 2021 VA diabetes examination, the VA examiner again found that the Veteran did not require regulation of activities. She continued to visit her diabetic care provider for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia less than two times per month. She had one episode of ketoacidosis and two episodes of hypoglycemia that required hospitalization in the past year. The Veteran did not have progressive unintentional weight loss and loss of strength. She did not have complications of diabetes.

Medical treatment records do not reflect any finding of diabetic complications. Indeed, a November 2021 VA treatment record reflects that the Veteran did not have diabetic retinopathy or macular edema.

The Board finds that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a rating in excess of 60 percent. Notably, it is conceded that the Veteran's diabetes requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities due to being hospitalized for an episode of ketoacidosis. As found by the October 2021 VA examiner, the Veteran only sees her diagnostic care provider less than two times a month for episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia-short of the required frequency of weekly visits. While the Veteran was hospitalized at least three times total for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemic reactions, the evidence reflects that she did not experience progressive weight loss or strength loss due to her diabetes. Because she simply does not meet the rating criteria, a 100 percent rating must be denied.

The evidence that may be reviewed by the Board persuasively reflects that the Veteran did not have complications of diabetes. Although the August 2020 VA diabetes examiner found that the Veteran had diabetic retinopathy, the VA eye examiner found that she did not. Additionally, the October 2021 VA diabetes examiner found that the Veteran did not have any complications. Moreover, the eye examiner's finding is supported by the other evidence of record, such as the November 2021 VA treatment record. There is no evidence, including lay statements, that conflicts with the October 2021 VA diabetes examiner's finding. Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have complications of diabetes during the applicable period being reviewed herein. As such, additional ratings are not warranted.

3. Entitlement to a TDIU on the basis of a single service-connected disability.

A TDIU may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the Veteran is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. In order to meet the schedular criteria for entitlement, the Veteran must have either: (i) one disability rated at 60 percent or more; or (ii) two or more disabilities, with at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability bringing the combined rating to at least 70 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extraschedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the schedular percentage standards. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b). The initial extraschedular referral analysis must address whether there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a veteran is unemployable because of service-connected disabilities. Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment and generally shall be deemed to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person. Marginal employment may also be held to exist, on a facts found basis (includes but is not limited to employment in a protected environment such as a family business or sheltered workshop), when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold. Id.

Entitlement to TDIU requires impairment so severe that it is impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. The central inquiry is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993). In making this determination, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to her age or the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The term "substantially gainful occupation" is not defined by VA regulation; however, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the term refers to, at a minimum, the ability to earn a living wage. A person is engaged in a "substantially gainful occupation" when that occupation provides annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2001). A determination of whether a person is capable of engaging in a substantially gainful occupation must consider both that person's abilities and his employment history. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 355-56 (2000). 

The Court has held that, although substantially gainful employment is any occupation that provides an earned income that exceeds the Federal poverty threshold, the Board must ensure that the veteran was capable of carrying out such employment. Indeed, the phrase "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" has two components: one economic and one noneconomic. The economic component simply means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. The noneconomic component includes a consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training, along with physical and psychological abilities. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019). In Ray, the Court noted that Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations provide guidance regarding what is considered substantial. Such SSA regulations provide that work can be substantial even if it is done on a part-time basis or if claimants do less, get paid less, or have less responsibility than when they worked before. Id. at 72-73. 

Here, in this case, the Board defines substantially gainful occupation to be that which is more than marginal and that permits the individual to earn a living wage. See Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991). It can otherwise be described as an occupation that "provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the veteran actually works[.]" Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 355 (2000). 

The term "protected environment" is also not defined by regulation. See Cantrell v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 382 (2017). The Board may consider the nature, length, and reason for termination of employment when assessing whether that employment was in a protected environment. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Factors such as the type and extent of accommodations received, the employer behavior or intent toward the veteran, and whether the veteran's income is significantly above the poverty threshold can be considered. See Arline v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 238 (2021) (Bartley, J., dissenting in part). In this case, the Board defines a protected environment to constitute employment wherein more than reasonable accomodation for the veteran's disabilities was required in order to secure or maintain such employment.

The Veteran has a high school diploma. Her recent employment history reflects fairly consistent full-time work. She reported that she stopped working on August 7, 2022 and that she became too disabled to work on that day. She worked in production full-time from September 2021 to November 2021 and in laundry from April 2021 to July 2022. She briefly worked part-time in a warehouse from June 2022 to July 2022, but then resumed full-time work in production for a short time from July 2022 to August 2022. She reported that the most she made in a year was in 2020 and that she made $7,870. See August 2022 VA Form 21-8940.

The poverty threshold in 2020 for a single person was $13,171. Based on the Veteran's report of her stopping full-time work in August 2022 and the report of her prior income, the Board finds that she has not been engaged in employment where she received more than marginal income since at least 2020. Thus, she has not engaged in substantially gainful occupation.

During the review period before the Board, the Veteran is service connected for the following disabilities: hirsutism, diabetes mellitus, bilateral eye lattice degeneration, and anemia. The Board will consider these disabilities individually.

	Hirsutism

The Veteran's hirsutism manifested in excess hairiness on different parts of her body. She must shave or use some sort of hair removal to maintain the desired cosmetic effects. Her activities of daily living are affected only in that occasionally there was some embarrassment in public, but this did not keep her from accomplishing what needs to be accomplished. See February 2010 VA examination. 

The Board finds that the Veteran is not unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful occupation due solely to her hirsutism. The Veteran reported that her hirsutism did not prevent her from accomplishing daily tasks. Although this report is from February 2010, significantly prior to the review period, there is no report or indication that her disability has worsened from that time. She also has not asserted that her hirsutism prevents her from working. For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's hirsutism does not render her unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful occupation and a TDIU based solely on hirsutism must be denied. 

	Diabetes Mellitus

The October 2021 VA diabetes examiner found that the impact of the Veteran's diabetes on her ability to work was that she would have to miss work for a period of time, such as taking sick days, and that she needed more breaks to take her medication and check her blood sugar, to include eating a snack.

Although the Veteran's diabetes would have an impact on her employment, the Board finds that the disability does not prevent her from securing and following substantially gainful occupation. Her diabetes alone did not prevent her from work involving at least some manual labor and most positions would allow for her to take sick days when necessary and breaks from work, including for a snack. Although she required some hospitalizations due to her disability, her sick leave would account for such absences. For these reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that a TDIU is warranted solely due to the Veteran's diabetes.

Bilateral Eye Lattice Degeneration

The Veteran underwent a VA eye examination in December 2021. The Veteran reported that her vision had changed, with her vision worse at night. Although her current glasses did not work well for her, she recently had an eye exam and was needing to pick up her most recent glasses. While at work, she had a hard time focusing on her materials up close and further away. The examiner opined that her correct vision was 20/20 or better bilaterally and that her eye condition did not impact her ability to work.

The Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral eye lattice degeneration does not alone prevent her from securing or following substantially gainful occupation. Notably, the main effect of this disability is that it is more difficult for the Veteran to see and focus her sight. However, especially in light of the Veteran's report that glasses fix these impairments, the disability appears to have minimal impact on the Veteran's ability to see or otherwise perform any duties necessary in a work environment, including when considering her education and work history. For these reasons, a TDIU solely on the basis of the Veteran's eye disability is not warranted.

	Anemia

A May 2022 VA hematologic examiner opined that the Veteran's anemia impacted her ability to work due to fatigue and shortness of breath, making it difficult to accomplish tasks. The Veteran reported shortness of breath with stairs and when walking.

The Board finds that the Veteran's anemia does not alone prevent her from securing or following substantially gainful occupation. Although the Veteran appears to have had some impairment with limited physical activity such as walking and climbing stairs, the evidence reflects that she could find work that is accomplished while seated or possibly even standing still. Even after considering her education and employment history, there are jobs available where the Veteran can remain seated, such as an administrative assistant. For these reasons, a TDIU based solely on the Veteran's anemia is not warranted.

Because a TDIU is not warranted on the basis of the Veteran's hirsutism, diabetes mellitus, bilateral eye lattice degeneration, and anemia when each is considered alone, entitlement to a TDIU must be denied.
