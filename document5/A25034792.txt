ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for dermatophytosis or tinea pedis with tinea unguium is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for maxillary sinusitis is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for lead poisoning is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's March 12, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) sought review by the Board of Veterans' of Appeals (Board) of a rating decision denying service connection for tinea pedis and sinusitis for which the Veteran received notice more than one year prior to the March 2024 NOD and prior to the February 19, 2019, effective date for the modernized review system.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had lead poisoning-or any residuals thereof-at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had mesothelioma at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinea pedis with tinea unguium are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

2. The criteria for dismissal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for sinusitis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

3. The criteria for service connection for lead poisoning, claimed as plumbism and/or saturnism, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for mesothelioma are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1998 to December 2001.

The instant matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for dermatophytosis or tinea pedis with tinea unguium and sinusitis

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  The Board concludes that the issue of service connection for dermatophytosis or tinea pedis with tinea unguium and sinusitis must be dismissed.

Review by the Board under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) is available within one year of the AOJ's issuance of notice of a decision on a claim where notice was issued on or after February 19, 2019.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500(a)(1)(ii), 20.202.  The March 2024 NOD sought review of the issue of service connection for a skin disorder affecting both of the Veteran's feet and sinusitis.  The most recent AOJ rating decision adjudicating service connection for tinea pedis and sinusitis was in January 2017.  The Veteran received notice of the decision in January 2017.  This notice pre-dates the February 19, 2019, effective date for the modernized review system, see 38 C.F.R. § 19.2, and pre-dates receipt of the March 2024 NOD by more than a year, see 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(a)(1)(ii), 20.202.  Accordingly, Board review of the issues of service connection for tinea pedis and sinusitis is not available as provided in the modernized review system, and these two service connection claims must, therefore, be dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for plumbism, saturnism, or lead poisoning

3. Entitlement to service connection for mesothelioma

The Veteran is seeking service connection for lead poisoning and mesothelioma based on toxic exposures during active service.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The AOJ has already favorably found that the Veteran was exposed to lead based on his use of ammunition during active service.  Exposure to asbestos, however, has not been established or favorably found.  Regardless, the occurrence of an in-service event or injury is only one element of service connection and does not in and of itself establish entitlement to service connection. "Congress specifically limits entitlement for service-connected disease or injury to cases where such incidents have result in a disability," and service connection is not warranted "simply because [a veteran] had a disease or injury while on active service."  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Service connection requires a present disability for which compensation can be paid.  Id.  

The Veteran is deemed to have been exposed to lead during service.  No such demonstration has been made regarding asbestos.  Importantly, the record does not show diagnoses for lead poisoning or any residuals thereof or mesothelioma.  The medical records that the Board can consider in adjudicating the claim are silent for any complaints associated with lead exposure, and there is no diagnosis for mesothelioma.  In the absence of present disabilities or at any time during the period on appeal, service connection for lead poisoning and mesothelioma must be denied. See Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

In light of the foregoing, the weight of the evidence is against the claims, and they must be denied.  Because the probative evidence weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable here.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
