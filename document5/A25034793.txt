ORDER

Entitlement to revision of the August 1987 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The August 1987 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability became final because the Veteran did not file a substantive appeal after the March 1988 Statement of the Case, and new and relevant evidence was not received within one year of the rating decision, nor were relevant service department records received at any time thereafter.

2. The correct facts as they were known at the time of the August 1987 rating decision were incorrectly applied, resulting in an undebatable and outcome determinative error, such that service connection for a back disability would have been granted had the facts been correctly applied. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for revision of the August 1987 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability on the basis of CUE have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1966 to October 1986 in the United States Navy. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

By way of history, the Veteran initially applied for service connection for a back disability in November 1986, which was denied in an August 1987 rating decision. Thereafter, he filed for service connection for a back disability in February 2017, which was denied in an April 2017 rating decision. The Veteran again filed a claim as to a back disability in October 2020, which was granted in an August 2021 rating decision with an effective date of October 14, 2020.

This matter was most recently before the Board in March 2023, when the Veteran's claim as to CUE, including an earlier effective date as to service connection for a back disability, was denied in a March 2023 Board decision. The Board declined to adjudicate the Veteran's April 2022 motion, finding that the April 2022 claim had not yet been adjudicated by the AOJ in the first instance, but did not refer the matter to the AOJ. Instead, the Board considered CUE in only the August 1987 rating decision, but not in the April 2017 rating decision. 

The Veteran appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In a June 2024 Memorandum Decision, the Court dismissed the Veteran's appeal as to an earlier effective date for the Veteran's back disability, as the Veteran did not challenge the Board's denial, and set aside the Board's decision denying revision of the August 1987 rating decision and remanded the matter. Specifically, the Court noted that the Board erred when it failed to explain why it had chosen to adjudicate the Veteran's September 2022 CUE motion rather than the April 2022 motion, which the Court noted was more extensive than that submitted in September.  

The Board notes that the April 2022 claim for CUE was a valid CUE motion. While the AOJ indicated in an August 2022 letter that the Veteran must submit a CUE claim on a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation, this status letter was incorrect. See July 2022 Status Letter. In fact, there is no specific form required for CUE. While the AOJ did not act upon the Veteran's April 2022 CUE motion until he filed a VA Form 21-526EZ in September 2022 also alleging CUE, the AOJ considered the evidence and argument submitted by the Veteran in both the April 2022 and September 2022 CUE motions in denying that CUE was present in prior rating decisions. Specifically, the January 2023 rating decision indicated that the evidence review included the Veteran's April 2022 and September 2022 submissions and all evidence therein. As such, the Board's review properly extends to both the April and September 2022 CUE claims to review the August 1987 and April 2017 rating decisions, as the AOJ considered both motions in the January 2023 rating decision that is now properly before the Board. 

Entitlement to revision of the August 1987 rating decision that denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability on the basis of CUE. 

A previous RO determination that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). 

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error." It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision. Id. 

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered. Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992) (en banc).

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442.

Review for clear and unmistakable error in a prior final decision of an agency of original jurisdiction must be based on the evidentiary record and the law that existed when that decision was made. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(iii).

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity. See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003). The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim.

The Veteran asserts that the August 1987 rating decision contained CUE in failing to grant entitlement to service connection for a back disability.

An August 1987 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement in November 1987. A Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in March 1988. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal following the issuance of the March 1988 SOC. Thus, the August 1987 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b). 

The Veteran again filed for service connection in February 2017. The claim was denied in an April 2017 rating decision which found that new and material evidence had not been received. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement in June 2017. An SOC was issued in December 2017. The Veteran did not file a substantive appeal following the issuance of the December 2017 SOC. Thus, the June 2017 rating decision also became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b). 

Evidence of record at the time of the August 1987 rating decision included service treatment records (STRs) and a VA examination. A January 1987 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran to have chronic low back pain with musculoskeletal strain based on his STRs, which noted ongoing treatment for and complaints of back pain, including an emergency room visit. The August 1987 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim as to a back disability, finding that that the examiner's diagnosis of chronic low back pain was not substantiated by the clinical evidence of record. 

Here, the Veteran's STRs and the January 1987 VA examination noted chronic low back pain with musculoskeletal strain and back pain throughout service. As such, the Board finds there was CUE in the August 1987 rating decision. The correct facts were not considered by the adjudicators, and the failure to consider the in-service documentation of low back complaints along with the January 1987 examiner's report manifestly changed the outcome of the rating decision at the time it was made such that entitlement to service connection for a back disability would have been granted but for the error. This was not a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated. Rather, the RO did not consider the evidence that showed in service treatment, a clear diagnosis of chronic low back pain, and a noted current disability. 

As such, the Veteran's motion to revise the August 1987 rating decision to the extent that it denied entitlement to service connection for a back disability on the basis of CUE is granted.
