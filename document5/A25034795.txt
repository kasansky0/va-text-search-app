REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 1970 to June 1971. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from February 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for peripheral vascular disease, low back, left hip, and right hip conditions.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral vascular disease is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his peripheral vascular disease disability is related to service to include exposure to Agent Orange. Alternatively, the Veteran contends that his peripheral vascular disease is secondary to his service-connected ischemic heart disease. See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Any veteran with "boots on the ground" service in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, is presumed by law to have been exposed to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).

"Service in the Republic of Vietnam" includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam, that is, within the land borders, including the inland waters, of Vietnam. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii). The phrase "service in the Republic of Vietnam" includes the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters of the Republic of Vietnam. 38 U.S.C. § 116A(d); Procopio v. Wilkie, 913 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2019). Here, in the February 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded the Veteran has service in Vietnam. 

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent (to include Agent Orange) during active service and has contracted an enumerated disease, the veteran is entitled to a presumption of service connection for such disease even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (e). Peripheral vascular disease is not among those diseases. Therefore, presumptive service connection based solely on herbicide exposure is not warranted.

Nevertheless, the Veteran may demonstrate his peripheral vascular disability was caused by his exposure to herbicides (or any other aspect of his service) on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. See also, Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (a presumption is intended to provide veterans with an additional alternative means of proof rather than limiting them to an exclusive means of proof).

The February 2024 rating decision concedes the Veteran has a diagnosis of vascular peripheral disease.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2023. However, this examination was inadequate because the examiner erroneously compared the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents in service to a diagnosis of dermatitis instead of peripheral vascular disease. See November 2023 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

As for the Veteran's alternative contention, that his peripheral vascular disease is secondary to his service-connected ischemic heart disease, entitlement to service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence of three elements: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) evidence of nexus establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

The Veteran has a current disability of peripheral vascular disease, and he is service connected for ischemic heart disease disability.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2024 to determine if there is a nexus between his current disability and his service connected coronary artery disease/ischemic heart disease disability. See February 2024 DBQ. However, the Board finds that this opinion is inadequate because the examiner did not address aggravation. See Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 89-91 (2018) (separate findings and rationale should be provided for causation and aggravation).

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

Here, the RO failed to obtain an adequate medical opinion to address direct and secondary service connection. The failure to obtain an adequate medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and therefore, remand is warranted.

The Board notes that after the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, in May 2024, the RO obtained a VA medical opinion to address direct service connection. While this medical opinion is outside of the evidentiary window and is not considered by the Board, the Board notes that the opinion is inadequate. The examiner provides a negative nexus opinion based on the lack of complaints and chronicity in the service treatment notes. However, the examiner does not address the Veteran's contention that this condition is related to exposure to Agent Orange.

"It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion...that contributes probative value to the medical opinion." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) (a medical opinion "must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

2. Entitlement to service connection for low back condition is remanded.

3. Entitlement to service connection for left hip condition is remanded.

4. Entitlement to service connection for right hip condition is remanded.

The Veteran contends that his low back, left hip, and right hip conditions are related to service. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his conditions were caused by continuous daily lifting of weights greater than 50 pounds which included lifting ship supplies and trash from one deck to another. See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; March 2024 VA Form 4138.

The Board regrets the delay but finds remand is necessary to properly adjudicate the Veteran's claims. 

In general, the Board grants service connection if the evidence establishes three key facts, or elements: (1) an existing disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, or "nexus," between the present disability and the in-service incurrence. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The first element of service connection is met. In the February 2024 rating decision, the RO conceded the Veteran has a current disability of the low back, right hip, and left hip.

Regarding the Veteran's reported in-service injury or disease, the Veteran contends his disability began during service. See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. While the Veteran's service treatment records show no complaints of back or hip pain, the Veteran is competent to report the occurrence of an in-service injury. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Thus, extending the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the second element. 

Finally, concerning whether there is a causal nexus between the in-service events and the Veteran's disability, while the Board observes there is an inherent logic to connecting the two, and the Veteran undoubtedly believes they are indeed connected, unfortunately the record includes no medical opinions on this issue. Therefore, the Board finds remand is required to obtain a VA medical examination and opinion to correct that deficiency.

A medical examination or medical opinion is necessary when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81-86 (2006). See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i). 

Here, there is evidence the Veteran has been diagnosed with low back, left hip, and right hip disabilities. There is evidence that these disabilities are related to service, but insufficient competent evidence to decide the claim.

Therefore, it was a pre-decisional duty to assist error for the AOJ to not obtain an examinations and medical opinions where the McLendon elements are satisfied. Remand is warranted.

As a final matter, the Board notes that in May 2024, after the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ obtained medical evaluations for the Veteran's low back, left hip, and right hip conditions. 

While this evidence is outside of the evidentiary window, the Board notes even if these opinions could be considered a remand would still be required as the medical opinions are inadequate.

The May 2024 VA examiners noted the Veteran's low back, right hip, and left hip conditions are less likely than not related to service. The examiner explained that the service treatment records are silent for complaint, diagnosis, or treatment for these conditions. Without chronicity during service or after service, a post-service event, illness, or injury is considered to be a more likely etiology. See May 2024 DBQs.

A medical opinion based solely on the absence of documentation in the service treatment records or that fails to consider lay statements is inadequate. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006). See also Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding that a medical opinion based solely on the absence of documentation in the record is inadequate and a medical opinion is inadequate if it does not consider the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and etiology of his peripheral vascular disease, low back, left hip, and right hip disabilities.

2.  The examiner should review the claim file, including this remand, lay statements, VA treatment records, service treatment records, and private treatment records. 

3. For each disability (peripheral vascular disease, low back, left hip, and right hip), the examiner must opine as to the following:

(a.) Whether it is at least approximately as likely as not the disability had its onset during service.

4. For the Veteran's peripheral vascular disease disability, the examiner should also expressly opine on the following specific issues: 

(a.) Whether it is at least approximately as likely as not the disability (peripheral vascular disease) resulted from or is otherwise causally related to any event or circumstance of service to include exposure to Agent Orange.

(b.) Whether it is at least approximately as likely as not that the peripheral vascular disease disability was caused by the Veteran's service-connected ischemic heart disease disability. The Board notes this is a "but for" causation standard-therefore, the Veteran's ischemic heart disease disability need not be the sole or even primary cause of the Veteran's peripheral vascular disease disability, so long as it is a necessary cause. In other words, if without the ischemic heart disease disability, the peripheral vascular disease disability would cease to exist, then the ischemic heart disease disability is a "but for" cause of the peripheral vascular disease disability. See Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

(c.) If "no" to (b.) above, whether it is at least approximately as likely as not that the peripheral vascular disease disability was aggravated (i.e., made worse beyond its natural progression) by the Veteran's service-connected ischemic heart disease disability. This aggravation opinion must be separate from the "caused by" opinion. The Board notes the "but for" causation standard described above applies to aggravation as well, albeit to the degree of disability rather than its existence. In other words, if without the ischemic heart disease disability, the peripheral vascular disease disability would be less severe, then the ischemic heart disease disability is a "but for" source of aggravation of the peripheral vascular disease disability. See Walsh v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 300, 306 (2020).

5. All opinions, findings and conclusions must be supported by a complete rationale, including references to patient history, evidence in the record, medical knowledge, publications, or other sources of information relied on in the examiner's analysis.

6. All opinions, findings and conclusions must take into account the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine, which means the VA must find in favor of the Veteran when positive evidence is at least "approximately balanced" with or "nearly equal" to the negative evidence on any material issue.

7. If any of the requested opinions or responses cannot be provided without resorting to speculation, the examiner must explain why this is so.
