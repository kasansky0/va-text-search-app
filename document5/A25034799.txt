REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral tinea pedis is remanded.

REASON FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1968 to December 1969 and from January 1970 to March 1993. 

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 26, 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the February 14, 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) the Veteran elected the Direct Review lane.

In a May 2, 2024 decision, the Board denied the claims. 

In a November 6, 2024 Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) the parties agreed that the May 2, 2024 Board decision should be vacated and the appeal should be remanded to the Board. On November 14, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) granted the parties' JMR, and vacated and remanded the claims for action consistent with the terms of the JMR. 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral tinea pedis is remanded.

The parties to the JMR agreed that the Board erred by not ensuring that the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) provided the Appellant with notice of his right to a hearing prior to issuing notice of its decision. Section 3.103(b)(1) states, "[c]laimants and their representatives are entitled to notice of any decision made by VA affecting the payment of benefits or the granting of relief. Such notice will clearly set forth... the right to a hearing on any issues involved in the claim as provided in paragraph (d)." The Court noted that paragraph (d) states, "[u]pon request, a claimant is entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim... before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim." 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1).

Accordingly, as the AOJ did not provide the required notice to the Appellant of his right to a hearing under 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103 (b)(1) and (d)(1) prior to the July 26, 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ committee a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error necessitating a remand to correct the error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Provide the Appellant and his Representative with proper notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ under 38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (b)(1) and (d)(1) .
