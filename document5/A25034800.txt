2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022 for the award of service connection for chronic maxillary sinusitis.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  Withdrawal may be made by a veteran or by an authorized representative and must be (1) explicit, (2) unambiguous, and (3) done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action by the appellant. Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 2018); DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 5758 (2011).  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, written appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b); see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 2 (2020).

In the present case, the Veteran submitted a written statement, received by the AOJ on July 31, 2024, wherein the Veteran, in pertinent part, indicated that he wanted to withdraw the appeal of all pending claims and appeals listed on the VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), submitted on July 17, 2024.  Furthermore, the Veteran specifically indicated that he wanted to withdraw the appeals of his claims for earlier effective dates of the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis and chronic maxillary sinusitis.  As the current appeal before the Board was the only appeal listed on the July 17, 2023 VA Form 10182, and the Veteran indicated that he wanted to withdraw the entire pending appeal, the Board finds that there is no reason to question the Veteran's intent to withdraw his appeal to the Board.  Accordingly, the withdrawal of his appeal encompasses his claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis and chronic maxillary sinusitis.

The Veteran's request was clear, unambiguous, and made with full understanding of the consequences; the Veteran clearly and unequivocally indicated that he wanted his appeal to be withdrawn.  The Board observes that the July 31, 2024 written statement contains the Veteran's name and claims file number, and the statement specified that the Veteran intended to withdraw the claims on appeal.  As such, the Board finds that the prerequisites for withdrawal have been met, and the Veteran's claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for allergic rhinitis and chronic maxillary sinusitis are withdrawn.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020).  Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review these claims and the claims are dismissed.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
