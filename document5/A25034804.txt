2. The criteria for service connection for sleep disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from September 2015 to September 2019.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time that those symptoms appeared. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39 40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

After the evidence is assembled, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for anxiety condition

The Veteran contends that he has an anxiety condition as a result of military service.

In the April 2024 rating decision, the RO determined that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease that had its onset in service. Thus, the Veteran has met one of the elements for service connection, an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury.

Turning to the current diagnosis element for service connection, a review of the Veteran's claims file shows that the Veteran does not have a current anxiety condition. 

The Veteran was provided a VA examination in January 2024. The examiner determined that the Veteran did not have a current mental disorder or any mental disorder diagnosis. The physician noted that the Veteran experienced anxiety but has never received mental health treatment and did not use any psychotropic medications. The examiner opined that there was no evidence to support a finding that the Veteran has a mental health condition.

The Veteran has not provided any medical or lay evidence of a current disability outside of making a claim for entitlement to service connection. Therefore, the Veteran has not met the current disability criterion for service connection. 

After a full review of the record, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim for service connection for anxiety condition, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for anxiety condition is denied. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. Entitlement to service connection for sleep disorder

The Veteran contends that he has a sleep disorder as a result of military service.

In the April 2024 rating decision, the RO determined that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease that had its onset in service for the sleep disorder claim. Thus, the Veteran has met the in-service incurrence of a disease or injury element for service connection.

With regard to the current diagnosis element for service connection, a review of the Veteran's claims file shows that the Veteran does not have a current sleep disorder condition.

In the January 2024 VA examination report, the examiner noted the Veteran's reports that he experienced restless sleep and had never received treatment or taken medications for his sleep disorder. The psychologist then opined that the Veteran did not have a formal diagnosis of a sleep disorder condition. And similar to the anxiety claim above, the Veteran has not presented any medical or lay evidence of a current disability outside of making a claim for entitlement to service connection.

Based on the evidence above, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has a current sleep disorder condition. The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for sleep disorder is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.
