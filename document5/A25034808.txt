ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 26, 2017, for the grant of service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder is granted.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for fatty liver disease is remanded.

Entitlement to an initial disability evaluation in excess of 70 percent for PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran initially submitted VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim on January 26, 2017, seeking entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.

2. The Veteran's January 2017 claim was denied via an August 27, 2017 Rating Decision that indicated that no service treatment records were available for review.   

3. The Veteran did not appeal that decision to the Board nor submit a request regarding another available review option within the prescribed one-year period.

4. Service treatment records were associated with the claims file in 2022.  

5. On October 22, 2022, the Veteran submitted an intent to file (ITF) a claim for compensation.

6. The Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application on November 2, 2022, and, in a rating decision dated March 1, 2023, was granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders effective October 22, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 26, 2017, but no earlier, for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.114, 3.155, 3.156(c) 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1997 to May 1998, with additional service in the Army National Guard from January 1993 to January 1999.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024, higher-level review (HLR) rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated March 20, 2024. Therefore, the AMA applies. See Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). On June 25, 2024, the Veteran timely filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and selected the Direct Review Docket. 

Under the AMA, the evidentiary record the Board may consider depends on the evidence considered by the AOJ in the decision on appeal and the Veteran's docket selection on the NOD. The present appeal stems from disagreement with the March 2024, higher-level review (HLR) rating decision, which for fatty liver disease considered the evidence of record at the time of the August 2, 2023, rating decision, and for an earlier effective date and increased disability rating for PTSD considered the evidence of record at the time of the March 1, 2023, rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 3.2500, 3.2601. As indicated above, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Docket when submitting the NOD in June 2024. The Board may therefore only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2, 2023, and March 1, 2023, rating decisions. If evidence was submitted after the August 2, 2023, and March 1, 2023, rating decisions, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim for fatty liver disease, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the readjudication of that claim on remand. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence for an earlier effective date and increased disability rating for PTSD, submitted after the March 1, 2023, rating decision that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, including the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an Earlier Effective Date for PTSD with Major Depressive and Alcohol Use Disorders 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for his PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders. 

After considering the evidence of record and the laws and regulations set forth below, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of January 26, 2017, but no earlier, is warranted for the Veteran's PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders.

  

Legal Criteria

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and grant of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for a grant of service connection is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from active service; otherwise, it is the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

Here, the Veteran initially submitted a claim for entitlement to service connection of his PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders on January 26, 2017. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, received January 26, 2017. The claim was denied in August 2017, and the Veteran was notified of the results via correspondence dated August 30, 2017. See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated August 27, 2017; Notification Letter, dated August 30, 2017.  The 2017 Rating Decision clearly indicated that no service treatment records were available for review.  The Veteran did not appeal that decision.  In 2022, service treatment records and service personnel records were associated with the claims file.  A claim to readjudicate the Veteran's entitlement to service connection for PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders that led to the present appeal was received on November 21, 2022. 

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1), at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. See Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("In other words, § 3.156(c) serves to place the veteran in the position he would have been had the VA considered the relevant service department record before the disposition of the earlier claim."). The Veteran therefore argues that the service treatment records newly associated with the claims file in 2022 dictate that the 2017 rating decision must be reconsidered and that such reconsideration would result in an earlier effective date of January 26, 2017.  See HLR - Informal Conference, received March 19, 2024. 

The Board agrees that reconsideration is warranted.  After resolving any benefit of reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board also finds that an earlier effective date of January 26, 2017 is warranted. In this case, the AOJ did not establish the in-service element of a stressor until after receiving the Veteran's STRs and service personnel records that supported his contention of a stressor in service while serving in Bosnia.   Therefore, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that the newly associated STRs and service personnel records were relevant to a matter in dispute pertinent to the VA's prior denial of a claim.  See Kisor v. McDonough, 995 F.3d 1316, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2021), petition for cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 756 (Jan. 10, 2022).  

Moreover, the record reflects that the Veteran experienced mental health symptoms for many years, commencing well before 2017.  There is no competent medical evidence demonstrating that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders at the time of the 2017 claim.  In particular, the 2022 VA examination that confirmed a diagnosis of PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders indicated the Veteran had been experiencing symptoms for many years.  Accordingly, given the significant amount of evidence demonstrating mental health symptoms going back many years and the Veteran's consistent statements regarding experiencing mental health symptoms for many years after service, the Board, after resolving any benefit of reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, finds that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders at the time of the January 2017 claim and that an earlier effective date of January 26, 2017 for the Veteran's PSTD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders is warranted. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Service Connection for Liver Disability

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Additionally, under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim, not just pre-decisional duty to assist errors. Id. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to service connection for a fatty liver disease as due to the service-connected PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders. See NOD, received June 25, 2024. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability that is due to or the result of a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Harder v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 183, 187 (1993). The controlling regulation has been interpreted to permit a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation of a non-service-connected disability by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Effective August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) implemented 38 U.S.C. § 1168, requiring a disability examination and medical opinion be requested for certain non-presumptive conditions involving toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). See Honoring Our PACT of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168. For such claims, VA is required to provide a disability examination and medical opinion when the Veteran submits a claim for compensation, has evidence of a disability, had evidence of participation in a TERA, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability. A Veteran can claim participation in a TERA explicitly or implicitly through service in a location presumed associated with toxic exposure, or records showing participation in a TERA; or, if VA has conceded exposure in a prior claim, or the file has a claim attributable to toxic exposure. Other ways to claim or establish participation in a TERA include when a Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) is associated with toxic exposure or when medical records suggest exposure to a toxic substance, chemical, or airborne hazard.

Here, the AOJ has conceded the Veteran's participation in a TERA and that the claimed primary disability PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders is service connected. See Rating Decision - Narrative, dated March 20, 2024. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Unfortunately, the evidence of record is insufficient to allow the Board to further proceed in adjudicating the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a fatty liver disease. Evidence does however indicate that in June 2023, the Veteran was treated by private examiner Dr. D.F. and was advised of the possibility that he may currently have a diagnosis of cirrhosis or some other liver disease. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, received June 16, 2023. Dr. D.F. went on to indicate that based on the Veteran's history with alcohol, a CT of the abdomen as well as additional lab work should be obtained. Id. However, after searching diligently, neither the CT scan nor the lab work was discovered. Remand is therefore warranted to determine whether such testing was conducted and, if so, the outcome.   Based on the fact that these potentially relevant records as to a current liver disability diagnosis were not requested, it was error for the AOJ to rely on the negative VA opinion that was premised on a finding of no current liver disease.

Increased Rating for PTSD with depressive and alcohol use disorders

The decision above grants an earlier effective date of service connection for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with depressive and alcohol use disorder.  The AOJ must be provided the opportunity to implement this decision and assign an initial rating for the disability for the period prior to October 22, 2022 before the Board's decision on the initial ratings to ensure the Veteran is afforded due process. See Disabled Am. Veterans v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 327 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991). 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.	Take all reasonable steps to obtain the Veteran's treatment records from Dr. D.F., to include requesting the Veteran complete VA Form 21-4142. Make two requests for the records unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile. If the requested records are not available, or the search for any such records otherwise yields negative results, that fact must clearly be documented, and notice must be provided to the Veteran.

2.	Thereafter, schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any liver disease and/or disability. The claims file is to be made available to the examiner and reviewed. After reviewing the claims file, the examiner is asked to identify all liver diseases and/or disabilities and for each identified disease and/or disability:

(a.)	Opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced, if not higher) that any currently diagnosed liver diseases and/or disabilities: (i) manifested during active-duty service, (ii) manifested within one year after discharge, or (iii) are due to the Veteran's participation in TERAs while on active duty?

(b.)	Opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced, if not higher) that any diagnosed liver diseases and/or disabilities was caused by, or is the result of, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders?

(c.)	Opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced, if not higher) that any diagnosed liver diseases and/or disabilities were aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD with major depressive and alcohol use disorders? The examiner is reminded that aggravation need not be permanent in nature.

In forming these opinions, the examiner must consider (1) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments; (2) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities (TERAs) in service; and (3) the lay statements provided by the Veteran.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including complete rationales for all opinions and conclusions reached, citing the objective medical findings leading to the conclusions. If negative opinions are provided, the examiner is asked to discuss alternate etiologies. 

The examiner is reminded that the Veteran is competent to testify as to the nature and severity of his symptomatology, and the onset of these symptoms.

3.	Implement to the Board's decision regarding the earlier effective date for the Veteran's award of service connection for PTSD with depressive disorder and alcohol use disorder, to include the assignment of an initial rating for the disability prior to October 22, 2022.
