REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 22, 2022, for the increased 20 percent rating for right shoulder painful scars under Diagnostic Code 7804 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2009 to February 2010. This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran selected the Direct Review docket without a Board hearing in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) review system by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board (Notice of Disagreement)) in March 2024. Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of March 21, 2022 - the date of the rating decision which prompted the Veteran's selection in March 2023 of the higher-level review lane. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601(f), 20.303. ("The evidentiary record in a higher-level review is limited to the evidence of record as of the date the agency of original jurisdiction issued notice of the prior decision under review and the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence."). If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after March 21, 2022, the Board did not consider it.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

An effective date earlier than February 22, 2022, for the increased 20 percent rating for right shoulder painful scars.

In this matter, a remand is necessary to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2022 rating decision on appeal. After review of the record, a remand is required in this case to ensure that VA's responsibilities under the duty to assist are followed and that the Veteran is afforded every possible consideration. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

The Veteran contends entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 22, 2022, for the for the award of the 20 percent rating for the service-connected right shoulder painful scars. The Veteran reported that her scars have always been painful and that the pain has worsened with no improvement. See 2/21/2022 VA 21-4138.

For background, the April 2019 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection right shoulder painful scars and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective September 18, 2018. Additionally, the March 2022 rating decision granted an increased rating of 20 percent, effective February 22, 2022. Further, in March 2024, the Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement with the effective date assigned in the March 2022 rating decision. See 3/19/2024 VA Form 10182.

As mentioned above, the Veteran asserts entitlement to an earlier effective date for the for the award of the 20 percent rating for the service-connected right shoulder painful scars. In support of this contention, the Veteran's authorized attorney representative argued that the Veteran has continuously pursuit this claim since September 18, 2018. Additionally, the representative argued the date of entitlement for the Veteran's painful scars was the date of the last surgery in August 2018, that the Veteran's scars have been painful and have been the same size since August 2018 and, as such, the Veteran "should have an earlier effective date that corresponds to her surgeries and the date of the filing of her claim, not the date of the last VA examination." See 3/19/2024 VA Form 10182.

In this regard, medical treatment records showed the Veteran's right shoulder scars were painful. See 3/14/2019 CAPRI, at pages 9 and 15; see also 4/15/2019 CAPRI, at page 14; 6/10/2019 CAPRI, at page 6; 2/26/2020 Medical treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, at page 6. However, the Board notes the treatment records did not specify how many of the Veteran's right shoulder scars were painful. 

The record showed that during the March 2019 VA examination, the examiner found the Veteran had two painful right shoulder scars. See 3/29/2019 C&P Examination. Further, both the June 2021 and August 2021 VA examinations showed the Veteran had no right shoulder painful scars. See 6/11/2021 C&P Examination; see also 8/30/2021 C&P Examination. However, neither the June 2021 nor the August 2021 VA examinations addressed the Veteran's treatment records that showed painful right shoulder scars nor the Veteran's lay statements that her scars have always been painful and that the pain has worsened with no improvement. See 2/21/2022 VA 21-4138.

Based on the above facts, since the record suggests that the Veteran's right shoulder scars were painful prior to February 22, 2022, the Board finds that the RO erred by failing to obtain an addendum opinion to determine how many of the Veteran's right shoulder scars were painful prior to February 22, 2022, as required for the Board to assign a rating in accordance with the diagnostic code criteria. In other words, the RO should obtain an addendum medical opinion that determines what is the earliest date it could be factually ascertainable that the Veteran had at least four right shoulder painful scars. In this regard, the medical evidence referenced above, that was of record at the time of decision on appeal, noted that prior to February 22, 2022, the Veteran had painful scars. As such, a remand is required to correct this duty to assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Forward the claims file to an appropriate clinician regarding the claim for and earlier effective date for right shoulder painful scars.

The examiner is asked to determine as best as can be ascertained; how many of the Veteran's right shoulder scars were painful prior to February 22, 2022. The examiner must provide specific evidence of record to support his/her conclusions, such as references from this Veteran's relevant medical history and/or medical literature.

In doing so, the examiner must address the medical treatment records, which showed the Veteran's scars were painful. See 3/14/2019 CAPRI, at pages 9 and 15; see also 4/15/2019 CAPRI, at page 14; 6/10/2019 CAPRI, at page 6; 2/26/2020 Medical treatment Record - Non-Government Facility, at page 6.

Additionally, the examiner must address the March 2019 VA examination, which showed two painful scars, and the February 2022 VA examination, which showed four painful scars.

Further, the examiner must address the Veteran's lay statement that her scars have always been painful and that the pain has worsened with no improvement. See 2/21/2022 VA 21-4138.

A comprehensive rationale for all opinions is to be provided. All pertinent evidence, including both lay and medical, should be considered. If medical literature is referenced, please provide a copy of it or a full citation that allows general access. If an opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).
