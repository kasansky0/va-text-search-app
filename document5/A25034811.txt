ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 15, 2011, but no earlier, for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

Service connection for bilateral hearing loss (hearing loss) is granted.

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

An increased initial rating of 70 percent for PTSD is granted effective July 15, 2011. 

REMANDED

Service connection for a right shoulder condition is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In September 1971, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. The Veteran did not appeal the claim within one year. Additionally, no new and material evidence was received within one year. Therefore, the September 1971 rating decision became final.

2. In December 2006, the RO denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for a mood disorder. The Veteran did not appeal the claim within one year. Additionally, no new and material evidence was received within one year. Therefore, the December 2006 rating decision became final.

3. In March 2011, the RO denied the Veteran's claim to reopen his claim for service connection for a mood disorder. The Veteran did not appeal the denial within one year. However, VA was in constructive possession of VA treatment records within a year of the issuance of the March 2011 decision. See July 2011 VA Treatment Records.  Therefore, the March 2011 rating decision was never finalized.

4. The hearing loss condition had its onset in service.

5. Tinnitus had its onset in service.

6. Beginning July 15, 2011, the Veteran's PTSD was productive of deficiencies in the areas of family relations, judgment, thinking, school, and mood.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date of July 15, 2011, but no earlier, for service connection for PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.400, 3.156(b), and Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 1111, 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

3. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131, 1111, 5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303.

4. The criteria for an increased rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for PTSD are met effective July 1, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1968 to November 1970. This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) on appeal from the September 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted his current claims for service connection for hearing loss, tinnitus, right shoulder, and PTSD. See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ and VA Form 20-0995. Subsequently, in September 2023, the RO granted service connection for PTSD and assigned a 50 percent evaluation effective July 1, 2023. Thereafter, in November 2023, the RO denied service connection for hearing loss, tinnitus, and the right shoulder condition. In response, the Veteran submitted a June 2024 VA Form 10182 (NOD) and selected the Direct Review docket at the Board.

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option for the PTSD claim, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of September 13, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after September 13, 2023 for the PTSD claim, the Board did not consider it. Additionally, for the hearing loss, tinnitus, and right shoulder claims, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of November 2, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after November 2, 2023 for these claims, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

As a final introductory note, in June 2024, the Veteran was informed that he had a year from the date his September 2023 and November 2023 rating decisions were mailed to him or within 60 days of the date the Board received his NOD to switch his Board review option. The Veteran did not respond to the Board's June 2024 letter. As more than year passed since the decisions on appeal were issued and the 60-day period specified in the June 2024 letter has lapsed, the Board finds that the period to switch his Board review option has expired. Accordingly, the Board will proceed with the adjudication of his appeal.

Earlier Effective Date

As indicated above in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of July 15, 2011 is warranted for the grant of service connection for PTSD. Accordingly, to this extent, the Board grants the Veteran's claim.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date for an award of a compensation based on an initial claim is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Generally, decisions of the RO and the Board that are not appealed in the prescribed period are final. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103. However, an exception to that rule exists. See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (2020) (holding that a claim remains open until the VA determines whether post-decision evidence received within the one-year period for a Legacy decision is new and material). In Lang, the Federal Circuit held that when VA treatment records are created within one year of a VA decision, those records are constructively before the adjudicator. Id. Moreover, if VA treatment records come into existence within one year of a decision, VA has an obligation to determine whether those records constitute new and material evidence, and if so, the claim must be readjudicated. Id. In a separate case, the Federal Circuit made clear that 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) requires VA to "provide a determination that is directly responsive to the new submission and... until it does so, the claim at issue remains open." Beraud v. McDonald,766 F.3d 1402, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

Here, in January 2011, the Veteran filed a claim to reopen his previously denied service connection claims. See January 2011 VA Form 21-4138. In March 2011, the RO denied the Veteran's claim to reopen his previously denied claim for service connection for a mood disorder. However, within a year of the issuance of this rating decision, the Veteran sought in-patient psychiatric treatment for his psychological symptoms. See July 2011 VA Treatment Records. The July 2011 VA treating clinician noted his chart reflected that he witnessed children and child soldiers killed during his service in the Republic of Vietnam. The clinician suggested that based on his medical history and evaluation that he endorsed symptoms consistent with PTSD and panic symptoms consistent with the in-service stressors from his service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that VA was in constructive possession of new and material evidence within one year of the March 2011 rating decision. The Board initially notes that although the Veteran filed a claim to reopen service connection for a mood disorder, the issue should have been expanded to include service connection for PTSD based on his VA treatment records. See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 4-5 (2009). Additionally, the Board finds that the July 2011 treatment records were both new and material because they did not exist at the time of and were not considered by the March 2011 rating decision. They were also material, as they showed that he had symptoms consistent with PTSD and his symptoms were attributable to his in-service stressors. Importantly, a subsequent decision addressing those new and material records was not rendered. Accordingly, the Board finds that the March 2011 rating decision did not become final as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b); Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Beraud v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1402, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

As the March 2011 rating decision was not final, his claim to reopen remained pending at the time service connection for PTSD was granted in September 2023. Although the Veteran was awarded an effective date of July 1, 2023 for the grant of service connection in the September 2023 rating decision, the Board finds that correct effective date for service connection for PTSD is July 15, 2011, the date the record established that entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(b), 3.400; Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Turning to the assignment of July 15, 2011 as the effective date, the Board finds that this is the first date as of which it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran had PTSD related to service, and thus is the date entitlement arose. By way of reminder, the proper effective date of service connection is the later of the two dates: 1) the date the claim for service connection was received; or 2) the date entitlement arose.  In this case, on January 24, 2011, the Veteran filed his claim to reopen his previously denied claims for service connection for his right shoulder and tinnitus. See January 2011 VA Form 21-4138. However, the RO construed this claim to reopen as including a claim to reopen service connection for a mood disorder because it was denied in the March 2011 rating decision. It was not until July 15, 2011, after the claim filing, that the record shows that the symptoms the Veteran was experiencing were related to PTSD attributable to stressful events in service.  Thus, the later of the two operative dates in this case is the date entitlement to service connection for PTSD arose. As such, the Board finds that July 15, 2011 is the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection for PTSD. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7?Vet. App.?498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table). 

Impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38?C.F.R. §?3.385. "When audiometric test results at a veteran's separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a 'disability' at that time, he or she may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is causally related to service."  Hensley v. Brown, 5?Vet. App.?155, 160 (1993).   

Where a Veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war or after December 31, 1946, and manifests certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system, to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309.  In an October 4, 1995, opinion, VA's Under Secretary for Health determined that it was appropriate to consider high frequency sensorineural hearing loss an organic disease of the nervous system and therefore a presumptive disability. 

For any Veteran who engaged in combat with the enemy in active service of the United States during a period of war, campaign, or expedition, VA shall accept as sufficient proof of service connection of any disease or injury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by that service satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of that injury or disease, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of that incurrence or aggravation in such service. VA shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. Service connection of that injury or disease may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b); see also Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (under 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b), a combat veteran's assertions of an event during combat are to be presumed if consistent with the time, place, and circumstances of such service).

Hearing Loss Condition

As noted in the Conclusion of Law section, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's hearing loss condition. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is granted.

The Veteran contends that he was exposed to noise associated with engines, generators, and diesel trucks in service. See June 2006 VA Form 21-4138. He reported that he was exposed to hazardous noise while performing demolition work and working near heavy machinery in the Republic of Vietnam. Id. He also reported that his unit helped fire howitzers in South Vietnam with the Vietnamese Army, and he was exposed to sniper fire. He reported an onset of hearing loss in service that continued to the present. 

At the outset, the Board finds that the combat presumption is applicable to the hearing loss condition in the current appeal. In Maxson v. Gober, the Federal Circuit stated that the combat presumption is an "evidentiary mechanism [that] involves a three-step analysis." 230 F.3d 1330, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The first two steps require (1) determining "whether the veteran has presented 'satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease' " and (2) determining "whether the evidence is 'consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such service.' " Id. at 1323-33 (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b)). The Federal Circuit established that, "[i]f these two steps are met, the Secretary shall accept the evidence as 'sufficient proof of service-connection,' regardless of the absence of official records." Id. at 1333 (quoting 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b)). The third step then requires an analysis of whether service connection "may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary." 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (b); Maxson, 230 F.3d at 1333.

The combat presumption not only allows the occurrence of both the "cause" of a disability, but the "disability itself." See Reeves v. Shinseki, 682 F.3d 988, 998-9 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("In short, although the record contained evidence of the cause of Reeves' disability... he still had the right to invoke the section 1154(b) presumption in order to show that he incurred the disability itself while in service.") (citing Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (2004)).

The combat presumption reduces for veterans who have engaged in combat the burden of presenting evidence of incurrence of an injury in service, but does not eliminate the nexus requirement. Collette v. Brown, 82 F.3d 389, 392 (1996). The Veteran must show that the disability he incurred in service was a chronic condition that persisted in the years following his active duty. Reeves, 682 F.3d. at 988.

A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). It is the Board's principal responsibility to assess the credibility, and therefore the probative value of the evidence of record in its entirety. Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429 (1995); Elkins v. Gober, 229 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Guimond v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 69 (1993); Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155 (1993). In determining whether evidence submitted by a Veteran is credible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other information submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995). The Board is not required to accept a veteran's uncorroborated account of active service experiences. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).

Here, the Board first finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hearing loss that meets the VA disability criteria. Therefore, the first element of service connection is met. 

Second, the Board finds that an in-service incurrence of hearing loss has been established. In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran has presented satisfactory lay evidence showing an in-service onset of hearing loss, and this evidence is consistent with circumstances of service. During service, the Veteran served as an engine foreman, and he received both the Vietnam Service Medal and Vietnam Campaign Medal. See DD 214. He reported that he was exposed to hazardous noise while performing demolition work and working near heavy machinery in the Republic of Vietnam. See June 2006 VA Form 21-4138. He also reported that he put sandbags around Howitzers. See May 2013 VA Medical Opinion. He also reported that he was exposed to sniper fire during service. See September 2006 VA Medical Opinion. Further, entrance and separation audiograms demonstrate that his hearing shifted by at least 15 decibels at multiple frequencies in each ear. See March 1968 and October 1970 Service Treatment Records (STRs). Based on the Veteran's MOS, lay statements regarding noise exposure, and his in-service audiograms, the Board finds that the Veteran had hazardous noise exposure during service. As such, the second element of service connection, an in-service incurrence, is satisfied. 

Third, regarding nexus, the Board finds that a nexus to service has been established. Although there is negative opinion evidence, the Board finds that the VA examiners failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that rebutted the Veteran's lay statements that his hearing loss was caused by service. Specifically, the November 2006 VA examiner based the negative nexus opinion in part, on a lack of evidence of auditory damage during service. However, this examiner did not address the shift in hearing from entrance to separation at the 1000 Hertz and 2000 Hertz auditory threshold frequencies, in the right ear. This examiner also failed to address the shift in hearing from entrance to separation at 500 Hertz, 1000 Hertz, and 2000 Hertz in the left ear. Further, the November 2006 and May 2013 VA examiners based their opinions, in part, on a finding that the Veteran's hearing was "well within normal limits at separation." However, there is no indication that the examiners considered the October 1970 separation audiogram findings as converted from American Standards Association (ASA) standards to the International Standards Organization-American National Standards Institute (ISO-ANSI) standards. Historically, when interpreting audiometric data from service treatment records (STRs), it is necessary to note that service departments changed from using ASA standards to using ISO-ANSI standards when providing audiograms beginning at some point between approximately January 1, 1967, and December 31, 1970, though the conversion date was not consistent between all branches of the armed forces. Therefore, VA must consider the recorded metrics under both standards, relying on the unit measurements most favorable to the Veteran's appeal. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that these opinions are inadequate.

In contrast, the Veteran has consistently reported that he first noticed that he suffered from hearing loss during service. See November 2006 VA Medical Opinion and January 2021 VA Treatment Record. As noted above, the Veteran is competent to report both the onset and continuity of his symptoms after service. See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470. Based on his reports, the Board finds the Veteran's reports regarding the onset of his hearing loss while in combat in Vietnam competent, credible, and consistent with the circumstances of his service in the Republic of Vietnam, as noted in his service personnel records. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(b).

In Lynch v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) held that, under 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), the benefit-of-the-doubt principle may be triggered where the evidence of record is nearly equal.  21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citations omitted).  The Federal Circuit further explained that this interpretation of 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) "necessarily includes scenarios where the evidence is not in equipoise but nevertheless is in approximate balance."  Id.

The Board finds Lynch to be applicable in the instant case as the evidence of record is in approximate balance, but not equipoise, regarding whether the Veteran's current hearing loss symptoms are attributable to his combat service versus other factors.  Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that a positive nexus to service has been established, resulting in a grant of the Veteran's claim.  Thus, entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

Tinnitus

As noted in the Conclusion of Law section, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for tinnitus. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim is granted.

As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to identify tinnitus and testify as to observable symptoms, such as ringing in his ears. See Charles v. Principi, 16?Vet. App.?370, 374 (2002); Layno, 6?Vet. App.?at 465. The Veteran reported that he experienced tinnitus since service. See May 2013 VA Medical Opinion. Therefore, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is satisfied. 

Second, as noted above, the Board finds that the Veteran was exposed to excessive levels of noise in service and that he sustained acoustic trauma as a result. The Board also finds that a nexus exists between the Veteran's current tinnitus and his military service. The Board acknowledges that the November 2006 and May 2013 negative nexus opinions. However, the Board finds that the Veteran is competent to identify the onset and continuity of his?tinnitus. 

As the Board has determined that the Veteran developed chronic tinnitus during his period of active service, service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. Id. Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

PTSD

As noted in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that an increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD is warranted, but no higher, effective July 15, 2011. Accordingly, to this extent, the Veteran's claim is granted.

Turning to the evidence of record, the relevant clinical evidence includes August 2023 VA medical opinion and post-service treatment records. The August 2023 VA examiner concluded that PTSD caused occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. Notably, this determination is not binding on the Board. 

As stated in the Findings of Fact section, the Board, however, finds that PTSD resulted in an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. In first addressing impairment in family relations, the Veteran reported that he lived with his wife, and his family is his social network. See August 2023 VA Medical Opinion. However, his VA treatment records show that he reported interpersonal stress related to his family. See May 2023 VA Treatment Record. See May 2023 VA Treatment Record. Additionally, the clinician reported that he had a persistent negative emotional state, suffered from anhedonia, and experienced feelings of detachment or estrangement from others. He also reported that he tended to isolate himself rather than interact with others. Although he seemed to suggest that there were no impairments related to his family at the August 2023 VA examination, his candor regarding his mood and thoughts suggest that his PTSD symptoms impacted his family relations. Based on the medical evidence, the Board finds that an impairment in family and social relations has been established. 

Additionally, the August 2023 VA medical opinion demonstrates that the Veteran experienced impairments in the areas of thinking, mood, and judgment. In this regard, the examiner noted that the Veteran endorsed depression, anxiety, suspiciousness, hopelessness, chronic sleep problems, and panic attacks that occurred more than once a week. See August 2023 VA Medical Opinion and July 2011 VA Treatment Record. The August 2023 VA examiner also noted that he had impaired judgment. Id. and July 2011 VA Treatment Record. Further, this examiner also noted he reported that the Veteran suffered from anger, hypervigilance, exaggerated startled response, and poor concentration. Moreover, the examiner noted these PTSD symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or other important areas of functioning. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that record demonstrates that the Veteran experienced impairment in the areas of mood, judgment, and thinking. 

Turning next to impairment in the area of work, the Board finds an impairment in this area. Although the Veteran is retired, the examiner noted that the Veteran experienced difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. The examiner also noted that his PTSD symptoms could greatly interfere with his ability to work due to his PTSD symptoms. The Board also finds that if the Veteran was enrolled in school, he would also experience an impairment in that area as well due to his PTSD symptoms.  

Although the Board finds that an increased 70 percent rating is warranted, it also finds that the next higher rating of 100 percent is not warranted for this period on appeal. In support of this determination, the Board finds that the PTSD was not productive of total?social?impairment as contemplated by the criteria for a 100 percent rating. In this regard, the August 2023 VA examiner noted that there was no evidence of any delusional thinking or hallucinations. The July 2011 VA treating clinician noted that he reported suicidal ideations, but that he did not have a current plan. Although the August 2023 VA examiner noted that he had impaired judgment, the Board finds that the record did not demonstrate that he was in persistent danger of hurting himself or others. The Board acknowledges that he was admitted into the hospital in July 2011 for psychiatric treatment, but he reported that he was feeling bad because he had recently relapse. However, the record does not demonstrate that he regularly engaged in reckless behavior, self-destructive behavior, or unprovoked periods of violence since July 2011 onward. Although the Veteran experienced impairment in?most areas as?contemplated by the regulation, the Board cannot find that his condition was productive of total social or occupational impairment, in line with an even higher?100?percent rating.? Further, the record does not reflect, nor has the Veteran reported, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, extreme memory loss, or an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.? As such, a higher 100 percent rating for PTSD is not warranted. 

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a 70 percent rating for PTSD, but no higher, July 15, 2011. ?See?38?C.F.R. §?4.7. 

As a final note, the Board has considered whether a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) was raised as part and parcel of the Veteran's increased rating claim for his PTSD. However, the Board finds that the record shows that he was employed until 2019, when he retired. The Board acknowledges that PTSD results in work impairment due to the severity of symptoms, but the record does not show that the was unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due to his PTSD symptoms from July 2011 onward. In this regard, there is no evidence in the record that he was unemployed or working in a marginal capacity for the period on appeal. Accordingly, the Board finds that entitlement to TDIU has not been raised by the Veteran or the record. If the Veteran disagrees, the Board invites the Veteran to submit a VA Form 20-0995 and VA Form 21-8940.

Lastly, to the extent that the Board in this decision limited its analysis to the Veteran's entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for the period since July 1, 2023, in implementing the Board's grant of an earlier effective date of service connection for PTSD, the RO will assign an initial evaluation for the severity of PTSD for the period prior to July 1, 2023.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Right Shoulder Condition

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that a remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the November 2023 rating decision. 

Specifically, the RO failed to fulfill its duty to assist the Veteran in developing his claim by providing the Veteran with a VA examination. VA must provide an examination or obtain a medical opinion in a claim of service connection when the record contains competent lay or medical evidence of (1) a current diagnosed disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability; (2) evidence establishing that the veteran suffered an event, injury or disease in-service; (3) an indication that the claimed disability or symptoms may be associated with the established event, injury, or disease in-service or with another service-connected disability; and (4) insufficient competent medical evidence for VA to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 81-83 (2006); see also 38?U.S.C. §?5103A(d); 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(c)(4). The threshold for finding that the disability may be associated with service is low. Id. A Veteran is competent to report his observable symptoms and history, including the onset and timing of symptoms, and such reports must be considered. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).?

Applying McLendon to the instant case, the Board finds that at the time the RO denied the Veteran's claim, there was evidence of a current disability and of an in-service incurrence of the right shoulder condition. Here, his post-service treatment records show that he has been diagnosed with acromioclavicular joint arthritis and supraspinatus cuff tear. See July 2014 VA Treatment Record. He also reported that he injured his right shoulder during physical training during service. See Id. and June 2006 VA 21-4138. Therefore, the Board finds that there was sufficient evidence showing an indication that the current disability may be associated with the in-service event and that there was otherwise insufficient evidence to decide the claim. As such, the RO should have requested a medical examination to determine whether the right shoulder condition was related to do so, and not doing so was a duty to assist error. A remand is necessary to correct it.

Based on the foregoing deficiencies, the Board finds that a VA examination is warranted. In ordering a remand in the instant case, the Board is not making a preliminary formal finding as to the credibility of the Veteran's lay reports.  Rather, the Board is merely requesting that the examiner on remand consider the Veteran's own descriptions of the history of his right shoulder condition. See Smith v. Wilkie,?32?Vet. App.?332, 338-39 (2020).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate clinician to determine if right shoulder is etiologically related to service. The Veteran's claims file should be made available to and be reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination. All indicated tests and studies should be performed and the results reported in detail. For all diagnosed conditions:

(a.) Please state whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that the acromioclavicular joint arthritis can be etiologically related to the Veteran's active-duty service in any way, including whether it manifested within a year of separation from service. Please explain why or why not. 

In providing a response to Part (a), please specifically consider the Veteran' statement that he placed a fellow servicemember on his shoulder during training and he heard something pop.

(b.) If you find that his acromioclavicular joint arthritis is related to service, please state whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that the acromioclavicular joint arthritis caused or contributed to the later development of a supraspinatus cuff tear. Please explain why or why not. 

(c.) Please state whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that the supraspinatus cuff tear is etiologically related to the Veteran's active-duty service in any way. Please explain why or why not.

In providing a response to Part (b), please specifically consider the Veteran' statement that he placed a fellow servicemember on his shoulder during training and he heard something pop.

For the purpose of providing the opinion requested, state whether a nexus between service and his right shoulder condition is medically consistent with the information provided by the Veteran. 

(The Board reminds the Veteran that in asking the examiner to accept the history she provided, the Board is not at this time making an assessment of the credibility of her statements).    

Please keep in mind that the phrase "at least as likely as not" means that "the favorable and unfavorable evidence is in approximate balance or is nearly equal.

A discussion of the underlying reasons for any opinion expressed must be included in your report, to include reference to pertinent evidence of record and?medical literature?or treatises where appropriate. If you cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why that is so (e.g. lack of sufficient information/evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
