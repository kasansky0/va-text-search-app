ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 9, 2017, but not earlier, for service connection for adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is granted.

Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but not higher, for chronic sinusitis is granted.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 40 percent for fibromyalgia is denied.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disabilities is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. VA treatment records containing new and material evidence related to the Veteran's claim for service connection for an adjustment disorder were created within one year of the February 2017 legacy rating decision that denied service connection for that disability and the February 2017 rating decision is not final.

2. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's chronic sinusitis manifested as three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting but did not manifest as three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting; and did not manifest as chronic osteomyelitis following radical surgery or near constant sinusitis after repeated surgeries.

3. The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for fibromyalgia, and there is no indication of symptoms or effects not contemplated by the rating schedule.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of February 9, 2017, but not earlier, for service connection for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an initial rating of 10 percent, but not higher, for chronic sinusitis have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.31, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6513.

3. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 40 percent for fibromyalgia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.14, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5025. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2014 to February 2017.   

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from October 2023 rating decisions (for adjustment disorder and sinusitis) and a November 2023 rating decision (for fibromyalgia) by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decisions on appeal constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

With respect to adjustment disorder, in August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of a claim for service connection most recently addressed in a February 2017 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a Supplemental Claim decision which implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted service connection for adjustment disorder with a rating of 70 percent effective August 24, 2023 based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

With respect to fibromyalgia, rating decisions were issued under the legacy system in October 2017 and November 2017.  In January 2019, the Veteran opted into the AMA by submitting a Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) election form.  The Board granted service connection for fibromyalgia in November 2023 and the AOJ issued the rating decision on appeal in November 2023 assigning a rating of 40 percent.     

In August 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review Docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decisions (for adjustment disorder and sinusitis) and at the time of the November 2023 rating decision (for fibromyalgia). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued these rating decisions, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R.               § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim for a separate rating for a TDIU, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Effective Dates

The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R.                    § 3.400. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on a reopened claim is the date of receipt of the new claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2), (r). Thus, once a previous decision has become final, the earliest effective date of service connection generally is the date of the petition to reopen rather than the date of the initial claim. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), a rating decision does not become final if VA fails to consider new and material evidence submitted within the one-year appeal period following the rating decision and that evidence establishes entitlement to the benefit sought.  Young v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 461, 466 (2009); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 252 (2011).  That is, when statements are received within one year of the rating decision, the Board's inquiry is not limited to whether those statements constitute notices of disagreement but whether those statements include the submission of new and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the creation of VA treatment records containing new and material evidence within one year of a legacy decision may vitiate the finality of that decision, without regard to whether VA adjudicators are notified of the existence of these records within one year of the issuance of that decision. Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020). 

New evidence means evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. Material evidence means evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, related to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Material evidence is: (1) evidence on an element where the claimant initially failed to submit any competent evidence; (2) evidence on an element where the previously submitted evidence was found to be insufficient; (3) evidence on an element where the appellant did not have to submit evidence until a decision of the Secretary determined that an evidentiary presumption had been rebutted; or (4) some combination or variation of the above three situations. Kent v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 1 (2006).

In order to be new and material evidence, the evidence must not be cumulative or redundant, and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim, which has been found to be enabling, not preclusive. Shade v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 110 (2010). When determining whether the claim should be reopened, the credibility of the newly submitted evidence is to be presumed. Justus v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 510, 513 (1991).   

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date of February 9, 2017, but not earlier, is granted for service connection for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. 

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for service connection for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and that the AOJ failed to properly apply 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) in assigning the effective date of service connection.  See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement. The Board agrees.  

The Veteran filed a June 2016 claim for service connection for adjustment disorder while she was still on active duty as part of a pre-discharge benefits program.  See June 2016 VA/DoD Joint Disability Evaluation Board Claim (VA Form 21-0819).  Her request for service connection was denied in a February 2017 legacy rating decision because the VA examiner found that her adjustment disorder had resolved and she had no permanent residual or chronic disability. The Veteran did not file a Notice of Disagreement to appeal the February 2017 denial of service connection for an adjustment disorder.    

In the year following the issuance of the February 2017 rating decision, VA treatment records were created showing that the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and was engaged in psychotherapy for that condition.  See, e.g., Mental Health E&M Notes dated May 2017, June 2017, July 2017, August 2017 in CAPRI Records (submitted October 4, 2017).  

The Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim in August 2023 renewing her claim for service connection for adjustment disorder.  She was afforded a VA examination in October 2023 and diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  The AOJ issued an October 2023 rating decision that granted service connection with an evaluation of 70 percent, effective August 24, 2023. 

The Board finds that the February 2017 legacy rating decision denying service connection for an adjustment disorder did not become final because VA treatment records containing new and material evidence were created in the year following the rating decision and there is no evidence they were considered by VA. Young v. Shinseki, supra; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  VA was in constructive possession of these VA treatment records. Lang v. Wilkie, supra. The records were new because they had not previously been submitted to the AOJ and they were material because they related to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the Veteran's claim for service connection, namely, whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of adjustment disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).    

Because the February 2017 rating decision never became final, the June 2016 claim for service connection filed by the Veteran while she was still on active duty was not finally adjudicated.  Accordingly, the October 2023 rating decision granting service connection relates to the June 2016 claim for service connection.  

As noted above, the date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. 38 U.S.C.                       § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  In this case, the June 2016 claim was received prior to the Veteran's separation from active service.  Thus, the effective date of service connection is the day following separation from active service, namely February 9, 2017.

Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date of February 9, 2017, but not earlier, for the award of service connection for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood is warranted.  The appeal is granted. 38 U.S.C.                   § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.  

Increased Rating Claims

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. It is permissible to switch diagnostic codes to reflect more accurately a claimant's current symptoms. Read v. Shinseki, 651 F. 3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011). 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Although a rating specialist is directed to review the recorded history of a disability in order to make a more accurate evaluation, see 38 C.F.R. § 4.2, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994).

Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Rating Schedule, but that findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21. Therefore, the Board has considered the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA benefits, whether or not they were raised by the veteran, as well as the entire history of the veteran's disability in reaching its decision. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

In general, all disabilities, including those arising from a single disease entity, are rated separately, and all disability ratings are then combined in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Pyramiding, the evaluation of the same disability, or the same manifestation of a disability, under different diagnostic codes, is to be avoided when rating a veteran's service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. It is possible for a veteran to have separate and distinct manifestations from the same injury which would permit rating under several diagnostic codes, however, the critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

The basis of disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

A veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by her senses. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 38 C.F.R.          § 3.159(a).

Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no obligation to discuss, in detail, the extensive evidence of record. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). Therefore, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence where appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus specifically on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as it relates to the Veteran's claims.

The veteran can provide competent reports of factual matters of which she has first-hand knowledge, such as experiencing pain in service, reporting to sick call, being placed on limited duty, and undergoing physical therapy. Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a lay person is competent to identify the medical condition (noting that sometimes the lay person will be competent to identify the condition where the condition is simple, for example a broken leg, and sometimes not, for example, a form of cancer), (2) the lay person is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, supra. Similarly, laypersons are competent to diagnose and provide nexus opinions to some extent, notably where the diagnosis or opinion is not of a complex nature. Id., see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

2. Entitlement to an initial rating of 10 percent, but not higher, for chronic sinusitis is granted.

The Veteran contends that her sinusitis is worse than contemplated by the currently assigned rating.  See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  In September 2023 correspondence, the Veteran stated that she experienced three incapacitating episodes of sinusitis in the one year prior to her claim for benefits.  See September 2023 Buddy/Lay Statement.   

The Veteran's sinusitis is rated as noncompensable throughout the period on appeal.    

Sinusitis is evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Sinusitis, Diagnostic Codes 6510-6514. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.  Under the General Rating Formula, a noncompensable rating is warranted for sinusitis detected by X-ray only.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or three to six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. A 30 percent rating is warranted for three or more incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis requiring prolonged (lasting four to six weeks) antibiotic treatment, or more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting. Finally, a 50 percent (maximum) rating is warranted for chronic sinusitis following radical surgery with chronic osteomyelitis, or near constant sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain and tenderness of the affected sinus, and purulent discharge or crusting after repeated surgeries. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6510.  

An incapacitating episode of sinusitis means one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6510.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2023.  The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with chronic sinusitis and noted that the Veteran's current symptoms attributable to chronic sinusitis were headaches, pain, nasal drainage, and congestion.  The examiner reported that the Veteran had experienced two episodes of non-incapacitating sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting in the past 12 months and no episodes of incapacitating sinusitis requiring prolonged (four to six weeks) of antibiotics treatment in the past 12 months.  The examiner observed that the Veteran had not undergone sinus surgery.  Imaging studies from November 2022 showed mucosal thickening and air locules in the right maxillary sinus with an impression of frothy opacification of the right maxillary antrum with a fluid level.  

A September 2022 VA treatment note states that the Veteran was diagnosed with an acute upper respiratory infection that was more likely bacterial than viral.  She was prescribed Augmentin, an antibiotic, for seven days.  A November 2022 VA treatment note states that the Veteran was diagnosed with rhinosinusitis.  She was prescribed Augmentin, an antibiotic, for seven days.  After the Veteran completed this course of antibiotics, a separate November 2022 VA treatment note states that the Veteran was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis and prescribed Doxycycline, an antibiotic.     

In light of the above, the Board finds that an initial rating of 10 percent, but not higher, is warranted for the Veteran's chronic sinusitis. Although the September 2022 VA treatment note describes the Veteran's condition as an upper respiratory infection rather than sinusitis, the note states that the condition was more likely bacterial than viral and the Veteran was prescribed an antibiotic.  Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran experienced three non-incapacitating episodes per year of sinusitis characterized by headaches, pain, and purulent discharge or crusting.  Accordingly, a 10 percent rating for chronic sinusitis is warranted.  

The Board finds that a 30 percent rating is not warranted because there is no evidence that the Veteran experienced more than six non-incapacitating episodes per year or three or more incapacitating episodes of sinusitis per year.  As noted above, an incapacitating episode is defined as one that requires bed rest and treatment by a physician.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6510.  Finally, a 50 percent rating is not warranted because the Veteran did not undergo radical surgery or experience near constant sinusitis after repeated surgeries.  Therefore, a rating for chronic sinusitis in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.   

The Board has considered whether a higher or separate rating is warranted under other diagnostic codes. However, the record does not reveal, and the Veteran does not allege, allergic rhinitis, bacterial rhinitis, granulomatous rhinitis, an injury to the pharynx, stenosis of the larynx, aphonia or laryngitis. Therefore, a higher or separate rating under Diagnostic Codes 6515, 6516, 6519, 6520, 6521, 6522, 6523, or 6524 is not warranted.

The Board has also considered whether a staged rating under Hart v. Mansfield, supra, is warranted.  The Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology has been stable throughout the period on appeal. Therefore, assigning a staged rating is not warranted. Further, neither the Veteran nor her representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

Accordingly, the Board finds that an initial rating of 10 percent, but not higher, for chronic sinusitis is warranted. To that extent, the appeal is granted.  38 U.S.C.                § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.

3. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 40 percent for fibromyalgia is denied.  

The Veteran contends that the rating assigned for fibromyalgia does not consider all the effects she experiences as a result of her condition, including psychiatric impairments.  See August 2024 Notice of Disagreement.  

Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's fibromyalgia has been rated at 40 percent.  

Fibromyalgia is rated under Diagnostic Code 5025, which provides a maximum 40 percent disability rating when fibromyalgia manifests with widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, with or without associated fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, paresthesias, headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression, anxiety, or Raynaud's-like symptoms, that is constant, or nearly so, and refractory to therapy.  "Widespread pain" means pain in both the left and right sides of the body that is both above and below the waist, and that affects both axial skeleton (i.e., cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine, or low back) and the extremities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5025.  

As the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for the entire period on appeal, there is no legal basis for awarding a higher schedular rating for fibromyalgia.  Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994). To the extent that the Veteran has alleged that her rating for fibromyalgia does not consider her psychiatric symptoms, the Board notes that the Veteran is in receipt of a separate 70 percent rating for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood.  

The Veteran has not alleged that an extraschedular rating is warranted for her fibromyalgia and such is not reasonably raised by the record. Bagwell v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 337, 339 (1996); Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008). The Veteran's symptoms related to fibromyalgia include fatigue, non-restorative sleep, headache, chronic pain in upper extremities and upper back, weakness, and pain in both legs.  See June 2017 VA examination; October 2017 VA examination; February 2020 Response to Board of Veterans' Appeals with Additional Evidence and Argument in Support of Appeals.  These symptoms are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria discussed above. Mittleider v. West, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998).  Since the schedular rating criteria are more than adequate in this case, the Board need not consider whether the Veteran's disability picture includes exceptional factors, and referral for consideration of the assignment of a disability evaluation on an extraschedular basis is not warranted.  Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 111; see also Bagwell v. Brown, supra; Floyd v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 88, 96 (1996); Shipwash v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 218, 227 (1995).  

Therefore, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 40 percent is not warranted. The appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.

REASONS FOR REMAND

In Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), the Court held that a claim for a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is part of a rating claim when such claim is expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record. 

In this case, a VA treatment note from May 2023 states that the Veteran works remotely as an attorney for a private law firm and travels as part of her job.  However, an August 2023 treatment note states that the Veteran has been unable to work as an attorney in a salaried position due to her disabilities.  As a result, she works part-time as an independent contractor and earned no money in July 2023. It is not clear from the record whether the Veteran is gainful employed.  

The Board finds that the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU is reasonably raised by the record.  However, additional information regarding the nature and scope of the Veteran's occupational activities is needed so that the Board may adjudicate the Veteran's claim for a TDIU.  The AOJ's failure to obtain this information was a pre-decisional duty to assist error.   

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Send the Veteran and her representative a notice letter informing her of what is needed to substantiate entitlement to a TDIU, to include a VA Form 21-8940, and of the allocation of responsibilities between the Veteran and VA for obtaining relevant evidence on her behalf.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
