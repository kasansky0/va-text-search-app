ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to service connection for reaction to severe stress disorder is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On May 20, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2012 to April 2012. 

In an October 30, 2023, rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for reaction to severe stress disorder. In that same rating decision, the AOJ also denied service connection for major depressive disorder.  

[In an April 21, 2024, VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), the Veteran requested review of the October 2023 decision as it pertained to the denial of service connection for major depressive disorder.  On the same day, the Veteran also submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), by which she sought to appeal a January 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder; she argued that an examination showed major depressive disorder.]  

In a May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran identified the October 2023 rating decision which denied entitlement to service connection for reaction to severe stress disorder and wrote, "cancel board review with law judge to HLR option instead." 

[On that same May 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran wrote a nearly identical statement for the major depressive disorder claim.]

In April 2025, the AOJ indicated to the Board that it would accept the Veteran's April 21, 2024, HLR request and process it for all pending psychiatric disorder claims. This would include the Veteran's claim for service connection for reaction to severe stress disorder.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1). 

In the present case, the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal by way of her May 2024 VA Form 10182. The Board finds the Veteran's statement on the form met the requisite criteria as described immediately above. Furthermore, because the AOJ has agreed to process the Veteran's April 2024 HLR for this matter, and concurrent election is prohibited in the modernized appeal system pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (b); there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration by the Board.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
