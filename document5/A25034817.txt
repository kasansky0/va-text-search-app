FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In July 2011, the Veteran submitted informal claims of entitlement to service connection for right and left knee/right and left "legs" disabilities.

2. In February 2013, the Veteran submitted formal claims of entitlement to service connection for right and left knee/right and left "legs" disabilities, which were denied in a March 2014 rating decision.

3. In the March 2014 rating decision, service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, was denied because the evidence did not establish the presence of current diagnosis.  The evidence of record did not establish the presence of a diabetes mellitus, type II, diagnosis until sometime in 2018.

4. Despite receiving notice of the March 2014 rating decision and notice of his appellate rights, the Veteran did not perfect an appeal and did not submit new and material evidence during the appeal period.

5. In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a formal claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension and diabetes mellitus, type II, which the RO found reasonably raised entitlement to service connection for kidney disability, as well as right and left lower extremity diabetic neuropathies, deep vein thrombosis, and erectile dysfunction.

6. In an April 2023 rating decision, service connection for hypertension was granted, a noncompensable rating was assigned thereof, effective August 10, 2022.

7. In a December 2023 rating decision, service connection was granted for diabetes mellitus, type II, a 20 percent rating was assigned thereto, effective August 10, 2022.

8. In a January 2024 rating decision, the scope of service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, was expanded to include erectile dysfunction and deep vein thrombosis, but the rating and effective date remained the same.  SMC for loss of use of creative organ was assigned effective August 10, 2022.  Service connection was also granted for chronic kidney disease, stage 2, which was assigned a 30 percent rating effective August 10, 2022.  Service connection was granted for right and left lower extremity sciatic diabetic neuropathy and right and left lower extremity femoral diabetic neuropathy; each of these four disabilities was assigned a 10 percent rating, effective August 10, 2022.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1969 to July 1973.  These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system on appeal from rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Specifically, after the issuance of March and May 2024 rating decisions, the Veteran timely submitted a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  Therein, the Veteran selected a Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.

In November 2024, the Board denied the above-captioned claims.  The Veteran appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In February 2025, the involved parties filed a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), asking the Court to vacate the Board's November 2024 decision insofar as it pertains to the above-captioned claims.  By a March 2025 Order, the Court granted the JMPR and remanded these matters to the Board for action consistent with the directives of the JMPR.

Preliminarily, in order to better understand the factual and procedural bases for these decisions, an examination of the relevant histories is helpful.

In July 2011, the Veteran submitted a variety of "informal claims" for service connection, including disabilities of the right and left lower extremities.  In response, the RO sent the Veteran a letter in July 2011, notifying him that, in order to process these claims, he needed to submit "the enclosed application."  A close inspection of the "enclosures" section of the July 2011 letter reveals that no enclosures were listed, and there is no contemporaneous, blank application form associated with the record.  The RO did not develop or adjudicate the Veteran's claims.

In February 2013, the Veteran submitted formal claims of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and right and left lower extremity disabilities, among others.  The RO developed and adjudicated these claims.  In a March 2014 rating decision, the RO denied service connection diabetes mellitus, type II, and right and left lower extremities (captioned and evaluated as right and left knee disabilities).  Despite receiving notice of this decision and notice of his appellate rights via a March 2014 letter, he did not perfect an appeal to the Board.

From October 2022 to January 2023, the Veteran submitted a variety of claims, including service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, right and left lower extremity disabilities, and hypertension, among others.  Additionally, based on the evidence of record, the RO subsequently found that the evidence of record reasonably raised the issue of entitlement to service connection for kidney disability, lower extremity diabetic neuropathies, and erectile dysfunction (with SMC for loss of use of a creative organ).

In an April 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for hypertension, assigned a non-compensable rating, effective August 10, 2022.  

In a December 2023 rating decision, service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and a 20 percent rating was assigned thereto, effective August 10, 2022.  

Then, in a January 2024 rating decision, the scope of the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, was expanded to include erectile dysfunction and deep vein thrombosis, but the already assigned 20 percent rating and effective date were continued.  The RO separately granted SMC for loss of use of creative organ, which was granted the same effective date as service connection for erectile dysfunction, August 10, 2022.  Also, in the January 2024 rating decision, service connection for right and left lower extremity sciatic and femoral diabetic neuropathy was granted; each of these four disabilities was assigned a 10 percent rating, effective August 10, 2022.  Additionally, the RO granted service connection for chronic kidney disease, stage 2, and assigned a 30 percent rating, effective August 10, 2022. 

In a March 2024 rating decision, TDIU and DEA benefits were granted, effective January 29, 2024.

The Veteran submitted an April 2024 VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher Level Review.  In response, the RO issued a May 2024 rating decision continuing the effective dates already assigned.  The Veteran timely submitted VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, seeking earlier effective dates for diabetes mellitus, type II; right and left lower extremity sciatic diabetic neuropathy; right and left lower extremity femoral diabetic neuropathy; chronic kidney disease, stage 2; hypertension; and SMC for loss of use of creative organ.

Generally, governing law provides that the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).  However, there are exceptions to the governing law that provide for different effective dates based on the circumstances of a veteran's military service.

Specifically, on August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (Aug. 10, 2022), was signed into law.  This is a liberalizing law which, among other additions, expanded the locations associated with presumptive exposure to herbicide agents.  Therefore, service connection claims granted under the liberalizing law of the PACT Act cannot be effective earlier than August 10, 2022 (the Act's date of enactment).

Service connection for the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, right and left lower extremity diabetic sciatic neuropathy, right and left lower extremity diabetic femoral neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, stage 2, hypertension, and, by extension SMC for loss of use of creative organ, was granted pursuant to the provisions of the PACT Act.  Consequently, the earliest effective date available for these grants is August 10, 2022.  Id.  However, the Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, under a different liberalizing law.

In Procopio v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) interpreted "served in the Republic of Vietnam" in 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(1) to unambiguously include service in the territorial sea of that country.  Procopio v. Wilke, 913 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  Prior to Procopio, Veterans known as "Blue Water Navy Veterans," did not receive the presumption of herbicide agent exposure afforded by the Agent Orange Act of 1991.  In Procopio v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit interpreted "served in the Republic of Vietnam" in 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(1) to unambiguously include service in the territorial sea of that country.  Procopio, 913 F.3d at 1376.  The court expressly overruled Haas v. Peake, 525 F.3d 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2008), which had upheld VA's "foot-on-land" requirement over a decade earlier.  Id. at 1373, 1380.

The Blue Water Navy Act of 2019 codified the Procopio holding and authorizes VA to award disability benefits retroactively to Blue Water Navy Veterans if the following criteria are satisfied:  (1) a veteran filed "a claim for disability compensation" between September 1985 and January 2020; (2) the claim was "for a disease covered by" 38 U.S.C. § 1116A; (3) VA denied the claim "by reason of the claim not establishing that the disease was incurred or aggravated by the service of the veteran"; (4) the veteran, on or after January 1, 2020, "submit[ted] a claim...for the same condition"; and (5) VA granted "the [new] claim...pursuant to [38 U.S.C. § 1116A]."  Crews v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 67, 80-81 (2023).

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to earlier effective dates under the Blue Water Navy Act for his diabetes mellitus, type II, right and left lower extremity sciatic diabetic neuropathy; right and left lower extremity femoral diabetic neuropathy; chronic kidney disease, stage 2; hypertension; and SMC for loss of use of creative organ.  See July 2024 Addendum to VA Form 10182.

The Veteran's right and left lower extremity sciatic diabetic neuropathy, right and left lower extremity femoral diabetic neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease, stage 2, were each granted service connection on a secondary basis to his diabetes mellitus, type II, as well as SMC for loss of use of creative organ based on the inclusion of erectile dysfunction.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, and hypertension was granted based on his presumed in-service exposure to herbicide agents.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309, PACT Act.

The Veteran's original claims of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, kidney disability, and SMC for loss of use of creative organ (via erectile dysfunction) were not received until October 2022.  Consequently, service connection for hypertension and kidney disability was not "previously denied" due to lack of service on the landmass or inland waterways of the Republic of Vietnam, and neither was SMC for loss of use of a creative organ.  Accordingly, the provisions of the Blue Water Navy Act are inapplicable to the Veteran's hypertension, kidney disability, and SMC claims and, thus, an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is not warranted under the Blue Water Navy Act.

VA received an original claim of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, in February 2013.  At that time, the Veteran also claimed right and left "leg" disabilities, as well as right and left knee disabilities.  The RO subsequently denied those claims in a March 2014 rating decision.  The March 2014 adjudication does not constitute a "previous denial" for right and/or left lower extremity sciatic or femoral diabetic neuropathy.  This is so because, despite the Veteran's February 2013 claims, the RO developed and adjudicated them only as right and left knee degenerative joint disease, not diabetic neuropathies and not disabilities associated with in-service exposure to herbicidal agents.  Consequently, claims of entitlement to service connection for right and left lower extremity sciatic and femoral diabetic neuropathy were not "previously denied."  Thus, the provisions of the Blue Water Navy Act are not applicable to these claims and, as such, effective dates prior to August 10, 2022, for the grants of service connection for these disabilities are not warranted under the Blue Water Navy Act.

The Board will now address applicability of the Blue Water Navy Act to the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II.  

"	The Veteran's original claim of entitlement to service connection was received by VA in February 2013 (which is between September 1985 and January 2020).  

"	Diabetes mellitus, type II, is a disease covered by 38 U.S.C. § 1116A.  

"	The RO denied the Veteran's claim in the March 2014 rating decision for several reasons: (1) the presumption of in-service exposure to herbicidal agents did not apply to the Veteran because he did not serve within the land borders of the Republic of Vietnam or its inland waterways, and the evidence of record did not otherwise establish that he was exposed to herbicidal agents, which meant service connection on a presumptive basis was not available; (2) the evidence of record did not demonstrate the presence of a diabetes mellitus, type II, diagnosis; (3) the evidence of record did not otherwise show that there was an event, disease, or injury in service; (4) the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, did not manifest to a compensable degree within 1 year following his release from active service; and (5) the Veteran's service treatment records did not contain complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for diabetes mellitus, type II.  The Board finds that these bases for denial satisfy the criterion of denial "by reason of the claim not establishing that the disease was incurred or aggravated by the service of the veteran."

"	In October 2022, the Veteran submitted another claim of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, which is on or after January 1, 2020.

"	Finally, in a December 2023 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1116A.  

Consequently, consistent with the February 2025 JMPR and February 2025 Court Order, the Board finds that the Blue Water Navy Act applies to the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, claim.  38 U.S.C. § 1116A; Crews, 36 Vet. App. at 80-81.

In the February 2025 JMPR, the Board is directed to provide adequate reasons and bases, addressing potentially favorable evidence of the Veteran's exposure to herbicides under the Blue Water Navy Act and consider the Court's holding in Crews.  See February 2025 JMPR, pp. 3-4.  The Board observes that neither the holding in Crews nor the February 2025 JMPR requires the Board to assign a specific effective date pursuant to the Blue Water Navy Act/38 U.S.C. § 1116A.  Indeed, in Crews, the Court stated that "the Blue Water Act permits the effective date for an award of benefits under that Act to be based on 'the date on which [an] individual filed [a] prior claim'" if the above-discussed criteria are met. (italics added for emphasis).  Crews, 36 Vet. App. at 80.  Moreover, in the February 2025 JMPR, parties to the motion cite to the Crews decision in stating that "the statute does not prohibit a retroactive effective date if a prior claim was denied based in part on the lack of a current disability."  See February 2025 JMPR, p. 3; (italics added for emphasis).  Thus, the Board finds that permission to assign an earlier effective date and/or not being prevented from assigning an earlier effective date does not equate to a requirement to assign an earlier effective date.  

Given the availability of an earlier effective date for diabetes mellitus, type II, under the Blue Water Navy Act, the Board must ascertain whether an earlier effective is warranted.  In other words, although the Veteran may be eligible for an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, under the Blue Water Navy Act, the Board must ascertain whether the Veteran is entitled to one under the relevant regulations. 

Again, the governing law provides that the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The date of the Veteran's original claim is February 8, 2013.  

The Board will now ascertain the date entitlement arose insofar as it applies to the Veteran's February 8, 2013 claim.

To establish service connection for a claimed disorder, the following criteria must be met: (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and current disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  Significantly, the existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1333 (1997).

In accordance with the February 2025 JMPR, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to herbicidal agents during his active service pursuant to the Blue Water Navy Act.  However, presumed in-service exposure to an herbicidal agent is insufficient in and of itself to satisfy the criteria for service connection.  The evidence of record must establish the presence of a current disability, among other criteria.  Id.

According to a September 2013 VA treatment record, "none" is listed next to diabetes mellitus.  

The Veteran did not otherwise submit or identify evidence demonstrating the presence of diabetes mellitus, type II.  Thus, at the time of the March 2014 rating decision, no current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II, had been established.  Moreover, the Veteran did not submit any new and material evidence within the appeal period following the March 2014 rating decision as to a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II.  Given that the Veteran was provided notice of his decision and notice of his appellate rights, the March 2014 rating decision is final.

Years later, the Veteran underwent a March 2023 VA examination.  The examiner found that the Veteran did not meet the criteria of a diagnosis of diabetes.  In a June 2023 addendum, the examiner indicated that the Veteran's initial diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II, occurred sometime in 2018.  This initial 2018 diagnosis was reiterated by an October 2023 VA examiner, as well as a November 2024 VA examiner.  Consequently, the presence of diabetes mellitus, type II, was not established until years after the March 2014 rating decision was final and, as such, the evidence cannot be considered with respect to the February 8, 2013 claim. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that, while the Veteran is eligible under the Blue Water Navy Act for an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for his diabetes mellitus, type II, he is not entitled to an earlier effective date based on the governing regulations.  38 U.S.C. § 1116A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Alternatively, the Veteran asserts that his July 2011 "informal claims" were unadjudicated and, thus, remained pending before VA until the grants of service connection.  As discussed above, the notice letter sent to the Veteran requesting that he submit formal claims did not specifically include an indication that a formal claims form was enclosed (i.e., blank enclosures note) and, thus, according to the Veteran, the date VA received the July 2011 informal claims should be the date of claim (citing to Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196 (1992)).

While the Veteran is correct in asserting that he submitted a variety of informal claims in July 2011, none of them pertained to diabetes mellitus, type II, hypertension, or kidney disease.  The first claim of entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, was received in February 2013, which was denied in the March 2014 rating decision.  Despite receiving notice of this decision and notice of his appellate rights, he did not perfect an appeal as to this issue or submit new and material evidence.  As such, the March 2014 rating decision is final.  

The initial service connection claims for hypertension and kidney disease were received (or found to be reasonably raised by the record) in October 2022; these claims are, at least in part, the origin of the appeal currently before the Board.  VA has already granted effective dates prior to October 2022 for these two disabilities.

The July 2011 informal claims included service connection claims for right and left knee/right and left "legs," which may be construed as encompassing the Veteran's lower extremity diabetic neuropathies.  However, even if so, the Veteran submitted formal claims of entitlement to service connection for right and left knee/right and left "legs" in February 2013, which were considered and denied in the March 2014 rating decision.  The March 2014 rating decision subsumes the July 2011 informal claims.  Given that the Veteran was provided notice of the March 2014 decision and notice of his appellate rights, but did not perfect an appeal or submit new and material evidence, the March 2014 rating decision is final.

In order to assign a July 2011 date of claim and be assignable herein, the finality of the March 2014 rating decision must be vitiated.  However, neither the Veteran nor his attorney have submitted or identified evidence or argument as to how the March 2014 rating decision is not final.

In making this determination, the Board considered whether the Veteran's or his attorney's assertions constituted a claim of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the March 2014 rating decision.  However, neither the Veteran nor his attorney have described an alleged error in fact or law with some degree of specificity, nor have they provided persuasive reasons as to why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error.  See Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993); Andre v. West, 14 Vet. App. 7, 10 (2000), aff'd sub nom, Andre v. Principi, 301 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002).  For a claim of CUE to succeed, it must be shown that the RO committed an error of law or fact that would compel later reviewers to the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Eddy v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 52, 57 (1996).  "Thus, even where the premise of error is accepted, if it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be, ipso facto, clear and unmistakable."  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993) (citation omitted).  As such, the Board finds that the assertions by the Veteran and his attorney do not constitute a CUE claim.

In sum, the Board finds that no formal or informal claim remained unadjudicated so as to warrant an effective date prior to August 10, 2022.  While the Blue Water Navy Act applies to the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II, and, thus, renders him eligible for an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection, the Veteran was not entitled to such a date under the relevant regulations.  Additionally, neither the Veteran nor his attorney adequately raised CUE or otherwise vitiated the finality of the March 2014 rating decision.  August 10, 2022, is the earliest effective date assignable.  Accordingly, effective dates prior to August 10, 2022, for the grant of service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, right and left lower extremity sciatic diabetic neuropathy, right and left lower extremity femoral diabetic neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, stage 2, and hypertension are not warranted.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
