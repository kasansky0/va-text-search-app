DOCKET NO. 240507-438805
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a 20 percent rating, but no higher, for bilateral dry eye syndrome is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran is diagnosed with bilateral dry eye syndrome.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 20 percent disability rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.20, 4.75-4.79, Diagnostic Code 6099-6025.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from June 2019 to April 2023.  During his period of service, he earned the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, National Defense Service Medal, Global War of Terrorism Service Medal, Korea Defense Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (3), and Marksman Rifle Qualification Badge. 

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an increased rating for bilateral dry eye syndrome

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Consideration must be given to increased evaluations under other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when assigning disability ratings.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If there is disagreement with the initial rating assigned following a grant of service connection, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time, based upon the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  But where service connection has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Veteran is in receipt of a noncompensable disability rating for his service-connected bilateral dry eye syndrome.  He contends that a higher rating is warranted.

The Veteran's eye disability is currently evaluated under DC 6099-6025.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.79.  Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.27 provide that unlisted disabilities requiring rating by analogy will be coded with the first two numbers of the schedule provisions for the most closely related body part and 99.  Here, the hyphenated diagnostic code indicates that the Veteran's eye disability is rated as analogous to a disease of the eye (Diagnostic Code 6099) under the criteria for disorders of the lacrimal apparatus (epiphora, dacryocystitis, etc.) (Diagnostic Code 6025).  38 C.F.R. § 4.79.

Under Diagnostic Code 6025, a 10 percent rating is warranted for unilateral involvement and a 20 percent rating is warranted for bilateral involvement.

The Veteran appeared for a VA eye conditions examination in March 2024.  The examiner noted the Veteran had bilateral dry eye syndrome.  The Veteran's condition was treated with over-the-counter artificial tear drops.

Here, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran and considering all evidence of record, the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's symptoms more nearly approximate the criteria for a 20 percent rating for bilateral involvement under DC 6025.  Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran's eye disability has been manifested by bilateral dry eye syndrome.  Thus, for the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that this evidence supports a 20 percent disability rating.  This represents the maximum disability rating under DC 6025.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that a 20 percent rating is appropriate for the entire period on appeal.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has applied the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
