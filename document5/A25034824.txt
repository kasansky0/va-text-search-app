DOCKET NO. 241017-483868
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1995 to July 1998. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision.

In an October 17, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran appealed the September 2024 decision and elected the Board's Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As a final preliminary matter, in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board generally may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) has elapsed. In this regard, 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new notice of disagreement within one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives an NOD, whichever is later, unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony. 

In this case, the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has not yet elapsed. However, in light of the fact that the Board is awarding service connection for tinnitus (thus reflecting a full grant of the benefit sought), there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication of the matter on appeal at this time.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury suffered or disease contracted in active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service injury or disease; and (3) a relationship between the two. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

In this case, a July 2024 VA audiological examination report indicates that the Veteran experiences tinnitus. Therefore, current tinnitus has been demonstrated. Moreover, there is evidence of tinnitus in service and evidence of continuous tinnitus in the years since service. In this regard, the Veteran has reported that he began to experienced tinnitus during service. Additionally, his post-service medical records and lay statements essentially indicate that he has experienced continuous tinnitus in the years since service.

The Veteran is competent to report tinnitus in service and continuous tinnitus in the years since service. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Moreover, his statements regarding his tinnitus are generally internally consistent, consistent with the other evidence of record, and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of his service. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran's report of tinnitus in service and continuous tinnitus in the years since service is credible.

The audiologist who conducted the July 2024 VA audiological examination opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was not likely ("less likely than not"/"likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal") caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner reasoned that the Veteran's service treatment records indicated that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability during service. This was evidence of no permanent auditory damage during active service. There was no complaint of tinnitus in the Veteran's service treatment records or at the time of his separation from service, and he did not report tinnitus until his service connection claim, which was more than 25 years after service. Although excessive noise exposure during service was conceded and he reported tinnitus at the time of the July 2024 examination, there was no nexus of auditory damage during active service to relate his current tinnitus to military noise exposure.

The July 2024 opinion is of little, if any, probative value because it is entirely based on the absence of evidence of tinnitus in service or for many years following service. The examiner did not acknowledge or comment on the Veteran's competent and credible reports of tinnitus in service and continuous tinnitus in the years since service. In this regard, a medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history (even if recorded in the course of the examination). Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).

In sum, the evidence reflects that the Veteran experienced tinnitus in service and that there has been continuous tinnitus in the years since service. He also experiences current tinnitus. There is no adequate medical opinion that is contrary to a conclusion that this disability had its onset in service. Thus, the evidence is approximately evenly balanced as to whether this disability had its onset in service. As the reasonable doubt created by this approximate balance in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. See also Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 ("If the Board concludes that the lay evidence presented by a veteran is credible and ultimately competent, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence should not be an absolute bar to the veteran's ability to prove his claim of entitlement to disability benefits based on that competent lay evidence").
