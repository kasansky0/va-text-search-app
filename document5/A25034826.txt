FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a December 2019 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), granted service connection for a right hip disability, effective December 2, 2019, and, inter alia, assigned the following ratings: 10 percent for limitation of extension of the right hip (5251) and zero percent for impairment of the right hip (5253).  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review rights in a letter dated December 16, 2019, but he did not file a supplemental claim, higher-level review request, or appeal as to this rating decision within one year.

2. On February 24, 2022, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating for his service-connected right hip disability, and a claim of entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability.

3. In a November 2022 rating decision, the RO, inter alia, increased the rating for impairment of the right hip (5253) to 20 percent, effective February 24, 2022, and decreased the rating for limitation of extension of the right hip (5251) to zero percent effective February 24, 2022.  In addition, the RO granted service connection for the left hip, effective February 24, 2022, assigning the following ratings: zero percent for limitation of extension of the left thigh (5251), and zero percent for impairment of the left thigh (5253).  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review options in a letter dated November 17, 2022, but he did not exercise any of the available review options within one year.

4. On December 24, 2022, the Veteran filed a new claim for an increased rating for his service-connected right hip and left his disabilities.

5. During the period under review, the Veteran's right hip impairment did not more nearly approximate limitation of rotation to 15 degrees or less; limitation of adduction causing an inability to cross legs; or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

6. During the period under review, the Veteran's right hip disability did not more nearly approximate limitation of extension to 5 degrees.

7. The record does not contain evidence of an ascertainable increase in the severity of the Veteran's right hip disability to include right hip impairment and limitation of extension in the one year period prior to receipt of December 24, 2022 increased rating claim.

8. During the period under review, the Veteran's left thigh impairment did not more nearly approximate limitation of rotation to 15 degrees or less; limitation of adduction causing an inability to cross legs; or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

9. During the period under review, the Veteran's left thigh disability did not more nearly approximate limitation of extension to 5 degrees.

10. The record does not contain evidence of an ascertainable increase in the severity of the Veteran's left thigh disability include left hip impairment and limitation of extension in the one year period prior to receipt of December 24, 2022 increased rating claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 20 percent disability rating for right hip impairment have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 4.7, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5253.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 10 percent disability rating for right hip limitation of extension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5251.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 20 percent disability rating for left thigh impairment have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5253.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 10 percent disability rating for left thigh limitation of extension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400, 4.7, 4.71a, DC 5251.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2016 to December 2019.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which, in pertinent part, increased the rating for impairment of the right hip from zero to 20 percent, effective September 11, 2023 (DC 5253); increased the rating for impairment of the left thigh from zero to 20 percent, effective September 11, 2023 (DC 5253); increased the rating for limitation of extension of the left thigh from zero to 10 percent, effective September 11, 2023 (DC 5251); and increased the rating for limitation of extension of the right hip from zero to 10 percent, effective September 11, 2023 (DC 5251).  The Veteran was notified of the decision by letter dated November 6, 2023.

On April 17, 2024, VA received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), from the Veteran, through his attorney, Brady P. Grove.  On the VA Form 10182, Mr. Grove identified the October 2023 HLR rating decision, the issues as "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for right hip impairment," "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for impairment of left thigh," "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for right hip limitation of extension," and "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for left thigh limitation of extension."  Mr. Grove elected the Direct Review docket.

By way of history, in a December 2019 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for a right hip disability, effective December 2, 2019, assigning the following ratings: 10 percent for limitation of extension of the right hip (5251), zero percent for limitation of flexion of the right hip (5252), and zero percent for impairment of the right hip (5253).  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review rights in a letter dated December 16, 2019, but he did not file a supplemental claim, higher-level review request, or appeal as to this rating decision within one year.

On February 24, 2022, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on which the Veteran sought, inter alia, service connection for a left hip disability and an increased rating for his service-connected right hip disability.  A claim for an increased rating on a VA Form 21-256EZ is an initial claim requesting a higher rating based on a change or worsening in condition or circumstance since the last decision issued by VA for the benefit.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?3.1(p)(1)(ii); 3.160(d).  Unlike a supplemental claim, a VA Form 21-526EZ does not maintain continuous pursuit of the prior claim.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.2500(c), (h)(1); Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277, 281 (2024) (holding that a new claim is distinct from a supplemental claim and, therefore, cannot be considered "continuous pursuit" for purposes of effective dates or for purposes of attorney fees).

In a November 2022 rating decision, the RO, inter alia, increased the ratings for impairment of the right hip (5253) and limitation of flexion on the right hip (5252) to 20 percent, effective February 24, 2022, the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim.  The RO also decreased the rating for limitation of extension of the right hip (5251) to zero percent effective February 24, 2022.  In addition, the RO granted service connection for the left hip, effective February 24, 2022, assigning the following ratings: zero percent for limitation of extension of the left thigh (5251), 10 percent for limitation of flexion of the right thigh (5252), and zero percent for impairment of the left thigh (5253).  The Veteran was notified of the decision and his review options in a letter dated November 17, 2022, but he did not exercise any of the available review options within one year.  

On December 24, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, on which he sought, inter alia, increased ratings for his service-connected right and left hip disabilities.

In a March 2023 rating decision, the RO continued the noncompensable ratings for limitation of extension of the right hip, impairment of the left thigh, and limitation of extension of the left thigh.  The RO proposed to reduce the ratings for impairment of the right hip, limitation of flexion of the right hip, and limitation of flexion of the left thigh.  After providing the required due process, in a June 2023 rating decision, the RO reduced the rating for impairment of the right hip from 20 to zero percent, effective September 1, 2023; continued the 10 percent rating for limitation of flexion of the left thigh, and reduced the rating for limitation of flexion of the right hip from 20 to zero percent, effective September 1, 2023.

In August 2023, Mr. Grove submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, on which he requested, in pertinent part, review of the March 2023 rating decision denying compensable ratings for right hip limitation of extension, left thigh impairment, and left thigh limitation of extension.  Mr. Grove also identified the June 2023 rating decision and the issues as entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right hip limitation of flexion, a compensable rating for impairment of the right hip, and a rating in excess of 10 percent for left thigh limitation of flexion.

In an October 12, 2023 rating decision issued in response to the August 2023 supplemental claim, the RO, inter alia, denied a rating for right hip impairment in excess of zero percent from December 2, 2019, in excess of 20 percent from February 24, 2022 (notwithstanding a period of a temporary total rating), and in excess of zero percent from September 1, 2023; a rating for right hip limitation of extension in excess of 10 percent prior to February 24, 2022 and in excess of zero percent thereafter; a compensable disability rating for left thigh impairment from February 24, 2022; and a compensable rating for left thigh limitation of extension from February 24, 2022.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 12, 2023 decision.

In the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision, the RO, inter alia, increased the rating for right hip impairment to 20 percent, effective September 11, 2023, increased the rating for right hip limitation of extension to 10 percent from September 11, 2023, increased the rating for left thigh impairment to 20 percent from September 11, 2023, and increased the rating for left thigh limitation of extension to 10 percent from September 11, 2023.  The Veteran was notified of the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision in a letter dated November 6, 2023.

As set forth above, in April 2024, Mr. Grove submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in which he identified the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision, the issues as "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for right hip impairment," "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for impairment of left thigh," "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for right hip limitation of extension," and "Entitlement to earlier effective date for increased rating for left thigh limitation of extension."  Mr. Grove elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 12, 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to Higher-Level Review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for service-connected right hip impairment.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the assignment of a 10 percent disability rating for service-connected right hip limitation of extension.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for service-connected left thigh impairment.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the assignment of a 10 percent disability rating for service-connected left thigh limitation of extension.

The Veteran's service-connected right hip impairment (5253) is assigned a noncompensable disability rating from December 2, 2019, a 20 percent rating from February 24, 2022, a 100 percent rating for July 19, 2022, a 20 percent rating from November 19, 2022, a zero percent rating from September 1, 2023, and a 20 percent rating from September 11, 2023.  He is also service-connected for right hip limitation of extension (5251), which is assigned a 10 percent rating from December 2, 2019, zero percent rating from February 24, 2022, and a 10 percent rating from September 11, 2023.

The Veteran's service-connected left thigh impairment (5253) is assigned a zero percent disability rating from February 24, 2022 and 20 percent from September 11, 2023.  He is also service-connected for left thigh limitation of extension (5251), which is assigned a zero percent rating from February 24, 2022 and a 10 percent rating from September 11, 2023.

In these matters, the Veteran asserts entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the assignment of a 20 percent disability rating for his right hip impairment (5253), a 10 percent rating for right hip limitation of extension (5251), a 20 percent rating for left thigh impairment (5253), and a 10 percent rating for left thigh limitation of extension (5251).  See, e.g., the VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) dated April 2024.  Notably, in the VA Form 10182, Mr. Grove asserted that, "[t]he Veteran had continuously pursued these issues prior to September 11, 2023" and therefore "staged ratings are not necessary, as the severity was continuous."  Mr. Grove has, unfortunately, provided no further argument or identified the date from which he contends the Veteran has continuously pursued the claims.

The Board notes that the Veteran is assigned separate disability ratings for limitation of flexion (5252) of both the right hip and left thigh.  However, he did not express disagreement with the assigned ratings/effective dates for these disabilities in the April 2024 VA Form 10182.  As such, the assigned ratings and effective dates for limitation of flexion (5252) of the right hip and left thigh will not be addressed in this Board decision.

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A claimant "may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing [an enumerated] administrative review [option]" following issuance of a decision by a RO, the Board, or the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).  An effective date will be preserved if a veteran files for administrative review within one year of any decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  However, while the date of claim is preserved when a claim is continuously pursued, the proper effective date is still subject to a finding regarding when entitlement to the benefit sought arose.

The reference above to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 52 (2011); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000) (noting that what matters when assessing the "facts found" is not the date an examination was conducted but the date the disability first manifested).

In this matter, the Veteran was granted service connection for right hip limitation of extension in a December 2019 rating decision, which, inter alia, assigned an initial 10 percent disability rating effective from December 2, 2019.  In the December 2019 rating decision, the RO also assigned a separate noncompensable (zero percent) initial disability rating for right hip impairment from December 2, 2019.  As set forth above, the Veteran was notified of the decision and his review rights in a letter dated December 16, 2019, but he did not file a supplemental claim, higher-level review request, or appeal as to this rating decision within one year.  Thus, the Veteran did not continuously pursue the claim of December 2, 2019.

On February 24, 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim (VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation)) in which he asserted entitlement to service connection for a left hip disability as well as entitlement to an increased rating for his right hip disability.  Nothing that could be construed as a claim for benefits or an intent to file was received between the December 2019 rating decision and the February 24, 2022 claim, nor does the Veteran so contend.

In a November 2022 rating decision, the RO, inter alia, increased the assigned disability rating for right hip impairment to 20 percent from February 24, 2022, the date of receipt of his claim for an increased rating, assigned a temporary total evaluation for surgical procedure with period of convalescence from July 19, 2022 to November 19, 2022, and a 20 percent rating from November 19, 2022.  The RO also decreased the assigned rating for right hip extension to zero percent, effective from February 24, 2022.  Additionally, the November 2022 rating decision awarded service connection for left thigh impairment and assigned a noncompensable rating from February 24, 2022, and awarded service connection for left thigh limitation of extension assigning a separate 10 percent rating from February 24, 2022.  As noted, the Veteran was notified of the decision and his review options in a letter dated November 17, 2022, but he did not exercise any of the available review options within one year.

The Veteran filed an increased rating claim for the right hip and left thigh disabilities on December 24, 2022.  This claim was submitted on a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), and was not a supplemental claim, a higher-level review request, or an appeal as to the November 2022 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a) (requiring a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary to be filed to be paid VA benefits).  A VA examination was conducted in February 2023 to assess the severity of the Veteran's right hip and left thigh disabilities.

Based on the evidence developed, in a March 2023 rating decision, the RO, inter alia, proposed to decrease the assigned disability rating for right hip impairment to zero percent, and denied increased ratings for right hip limitation of extension, left thigh impairment, and left thigh limitation of extension.  After providing due process, in a June 2023 rating decision, the RO, inter alia, effectuated the proposed reduction of the rating for right hip impairment to zero percent, effective from September 1, 2023.

In August 2023, Mr. Grove submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, on which he requested, in pertinent part, review of the March 2023 rating decision denying compensable ratings for right hip limitation of extension, left thigh impairment, and left thigh limitation of extension.  Mr. Grove also identified the June 2023 rating decision and, in pertinent part, the issue of entitlement to a compensable rating for impairment of the right hip.  Cf. Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992) (distinguishing between rating reduction issues and increased rating claims).

The Board recognizes that the August 2023 supplemental claim was filed within one year of the November 2022 rating decision.  However, Mr. Grove specifically requested review of the March 2023 rating decision denying compensable ratings for right hip limitation of extension, left thigh impairment, and left thigh limitation of extension, as well as the June 2023 rating decision, in pertinent part, assigning a noncompensable rating for impairment of the right hip.  Therefore, the August 2023 supplemental claim was not an attempt to seek review of the claims adjudicated in the November 2022 rating decision, but was rather a supplemental claim that specifically sought review of the matters adjudicated in the March 2023 and June 2023 rating decisions.  The Board therefore finds that the November 2022 rating decision became final, and the Veteran did not continuously pursue his right hip and left thigh claims from the February 24, 2022 increased rating claim.

In rendering this finding, the Board recognizes the recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims, LEXIS 336* (March 13, 2025) (holding that when a veteran is seeking higher ratings for their service-connected disabilities by applying for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), the TDIU application (VA Form 21-8940) may serve as a supplemental claim in the AMA when it is filed after VA denies increased ratings for those disabilities).  However, in Chisholm, the Court did not hold that VA claims forms are interchangeable, but rather that a TDIU claim could potentially be interpreted as a supplemental claim for an increased rating in conjunction with specific evidence and argument submitted by a veteran.  That is not the case here.  The Veteran did not submit a TDIU claim within a year of the November 2022 rating decision and, as such, the requirement to submit a supplemental claim on the correct form pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a) may not be waived.

In an October 12, 2023 rating decision issued in response to the August 2023 supplemental claim, the RO, inter alia, determined that for right hip impairment, a compensable rating from December 2, 2019, a rating in excess of 20 percent from February 24, 2022 (notwithstanding the period of the temporary total rating), and a compensable rating from September 1, 2023, could not be established.  The RO also determined that a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to February 24, 2022 and in excess of zero percent thereafter for right hip limitation of extension could not be established.  Finally, the RO determined that compensable ratings for left thigh impairment and left thigh limitation of extension could not be established.

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 12, 2023 decision.  In the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision, the RO, in pertinent part, increased the rating for right hip impairment to 20 percent, effective from September 11, 2023, increased the rating for right hip limitation of extension to 10 percent from September 11, 2023, increased the rating for left thigh impairment to 20 percent from September 11, 2023, and increased the rating for left thigh limitation of extension to 10 percent from September 11, 2023.  The Veteran was notified of the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision in a letter dated November 6, 2023.  As indicated above, Mr. Grove submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), in April 2024, in which he identified the October 24, 2023 HLR rating decision and elected the Direct Review docket.

Accordingly, based upon the procedural history set forth in pertinent part above, the Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his right hip and left thigh claims from December 24, 2022, but no earlier, based upon the date he filed the VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), seeking entitlement to increased disability ratings.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.2500(c), (h).

As the right hip and left thigh disability claims were based upon an increased rating claim, the Board will now consider whether, for the period dated from December 24, 2022 to September 11, 2023, the criteria for a 20 percent disability rating for right hip impairment (5253), a 10 percent disability rating for right hip limitation of extension (5251), a 20 percent disability rating is for left hip impairment (5253), and a 10 percent disability for left hip limitation of extension (5251) are met.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The Board will also consider whether entitlement to these increased disability ratings for the right hip and left thigh is warranted within the one-year look back period prior to the December 24, 2022 increased rating claim, subject to the February 24, 2022 effective date assigned for service connection for the Veteran's left thigh disabilities.  Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The Veteran's service-connected right hip and left thigh impairment disabilities are rated under DC 5253 (thigh, impairment of) and his right hip and left thigh limitation of extension disabilities are rated under DC 5251 (thigh, limitation of extension).

During the pendency of the appeal, the rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021.  85 Fed. Reg. 230 (Nov. 30, 2020).  No changes were made to diagnostic codes 5251 or 5253.

Under DC 5251 for limitation of extension of thigh, a 10 percent rating is warranted for extension limited to 5 degrees.

Under DC 5253 for impairment of thigh, a 10 percent rating is warranted for limitation of rotation of, cannot toe-out more than 15°, affected leg.  A 10 percent rating is additionally warranted for limitation of adduction, cannot cross legs.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees.

Turning to the evidence, VA treatment records dated in December 2021 documented the Veteran's report of right hip pain for which he was taking over-the-counter Tylenol and Advil.  He indicated that his hip pain was at 4/10 in severity.  VA treatment records dated in March 2022 noted the Veteran's report of right hip pain at a 1/10 in severity.  The Veteran's treatment provider noted that the Veteran's report that he was previously advised he had a labral tear and impingement in his right hip and needed surgery.  However, he did not proceed with the surgery because he started a new job.  The treatment provider conducted range of motion testing, and noted that the Veteran's right hip flexion was to 95 degrees with pain, extension was to 45 degrees with pain, and his internal rotation was to 20 degrees.

Private treatment records dated in June 2022 noted the Veteran's report of continuing right hip pain, which he described as aching, throbbing, and constant.  He indicated that his right hip pain was at 7/10 in severity.  He stated that his right hip pain is better when sitting down with his leg propped up.  Range of motion testing of the right hip revealed flexion to 120 degrees, extension to 70 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  The examiner reported that sensation to light touch was intact throughout both hips.

In July 2022, the Veteran underwent a right hip arthroscopy with labral repair.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022 at which time the examiner diagnosed right femoral acetabular impingement syndrome including labral tears.  He also noted that the Veteran reported left hip pain.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran completed physical therapy for his right hip two weeks ago.  The Veteran reported daily right hip pain at 7/10 in severity and daily left hip pain at 5-6/10 in severity.  His right and left hip pain is brought on with walking 100 yards, squatting, or going up steps.  He reported that his right hip pain flares to 8-9/10 in severity.  Range of motion testing of the right hip revealed flexion to 75 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 30 degrees, adduction to 15 degrees, external rotation to 30 degrees, and internal rotation to 35 degrees with pain throughout motion.  Range of motion testing of the left hip revealed flexion to 80 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 40 degrees, adduction to 25 degrees, external rotation to 60 degrees, and internal rotation to 40 degrees.  Range of motion testing measurements were the same in both passive and active motion.  The examiner reported that limitation of adduction of the right hip does prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs in both active and passive motion.  Limitation of adduction of the left hip does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs in either active or passive motion.  The examiner reported that the Veteran exhibited pain with weight-bearing, nonweight-bearing, active and passive motion, and rest/movement in both hips.  Pain causes functional loss.  There was no additional limitation of motion on repetitive use testing of either hip.

The November 2022 examiner opined that the procured evidence suggests that pain and fatigability significantly limit the functional ability of the Veteran's right and left hips with repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  The examiner estimated that with repeated use over time, the Veteran's range of motion of the right hip is limited to flexion to 30 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, abduction to 20 degrees, adduction to 10 degrees, external rotation to 20 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  As to the left hip, the examiner estimated that, with repeated use over time, the Veteran's exhibits flexion to 55 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 25 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 60 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  During flare-ups, range of motion of the right hips is additionally limited to flexion to 30 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, abduction to 10 degrees, adduction to 10 degrees, external rotation to 10 degrees, and internal rotation to 10 degrees.  The examiner noted that the Veteran experiences "increased pain with extended use" of the right hip.  The estimated range of motion measurements provided by the examiner for left hip during flare-ups was the same as with repeated use over time.  The examiner reported that the Veteran does not have muscle atrophy or ankylosis in either hip.  He noted that the Veteran experiences difficulty with prolonged walking, walking up and down steps, and squatting.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in February 2023 at which time the examiner diagnosed bilateral femoral acetabular impingement syndrome, including labral tears.  The examiner noted that the Veteran reports new symptoms of his right hip locking up on him while walking.  He stated that these symptoms began in approximately January 2023.  The Veteran takes Tylenol to treat hip pain.  The Veteran described flare-ups of bilateral hip pain at 8-9/10 in severity.  Range of motion testing of the right hip revealed flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 30, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 35 degrees, and internal rotation to 30 degrees.  There was pain with flexion, adduction, and external rotation.  Range of motion of the left hip revealed flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, abduction to 40 degrees, adduction to 25 de3grees, external rotation to 60 degrees, and internal rotation to 40 degrees.  The examiner reported that passive motion of the left hip was the same as active motion; however, the Veteran was able to achieve extension to 30 degrees.  The examiner reported that limitation in passive motion does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  There was no evidence of crepitus.  There was no additional limitation of motion on repetitive use testing.  The examiner reported that the procured evidence suggests pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability of the right hip with repeated use over time.  The examiner estimated that, in the right hip with repeated use over time, flexion is 90 degrees, extension is 25 degrees, abduction is 30 degrees, adduction is 25 degrees, external rotation is 35 degrees, and internal rotation is 20 degrees.  The examiner reported that these estimates were "based on patient demonstration."  The examiner reported that the procured evidence does not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability of the left hip with repeated use over time.  The examiner stated that limitation in adduction after repeated use over time does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  The examiner reported that the procured evidence does not suggest that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limit the Veteran's functional ability in either hip during flare-ups.  The Veteran does not use an assistive device for ambulation.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's right and left hip disabilities do impact his ability to perform any type of occupational task; specifically, the "Veteran states he is functionally unable to run and is limited with taking stairs."  The examiner additionally noted "[h]ip exam reveals [the Veteran] displaying poor effort.  20 degree left hip forward movement after [sitting] at 90 degrees angle."

VA treatment records dated in July 2023 noted the Veteran's history of popping and locking of the right hip.  X-rays of the right and left hips revealed, "[n]o acute osseous abnormality or significant degenerative changes."

In an August 2023 statement, the Veteran explained that he underwent right hip surgery in July 2022 and "now my right hip is limited on flexion, it makes it difficult to walk.  [O]n my worst days, I have to ice it and prop it up because the pain is so bad it makes me sick to my stomach."  He further stated that his right hip impairment, "[l]imits my day to day function due to making it hard to walk and run when I have to."

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in September 2023 at which time the examiner noted the Veteran's report of leg pain, difficulty bending and squatting, as well as pain into the groin area.  The Veteran reported that his hip disabilities have worsened over time.  His current symptoms are pain in the hips, which cause the legs to lock up.  The Veteran described the following impact on occupational functioning and ordinary activities: "[d]ifficulty climbing stairs or walking up steps."  The Veteran endorsed flare-ups of right and left hip symptoms.  His right hip flare-ups occur 4 to 5 times per week, are severe, and last 3-4 hours.  His left hip flare-ups occur 2 times per week, are moderate, and last 1 hour.  The Veteran's flare-ups are precipitated by walking or bending, and are alleviated by Tylenol, rest, and sitting.  Range of motion testing of the right hip revealed flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, abduction to 20 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 30 degrees, and internal rotation to 20 degrees.  Range of motion testing of the left hip revealed flexion to 50 degrees, extension to 10 degrees, abduction to 20 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, external rotation to 30 degrees, and internal rotation to 20 degrees.  There was pain throughout motion of both hips.  The examiner reported that limitation in adduction does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  Passive range of motion was the same as active.  There was pain with nonweight-bearing, active and passive motion, and the pain causes functional loss.  The examiner noted, "[t]he Veteran complained of pain during range of motion that adds to functional loss of mobility."  There was on objective evidence of crepitus or localized tenderness.  There was no additional limitation of motion on repetitive use testing.  The examiner reported that the procured evidence suggests that pain significantly limits the functional ability of the Veteran's right and left hips with repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  The examiner estimated that range of motion of the right hip was additionally limited as follows:  flexion to 50 degrees, extension to 5 degrees, abduction to 10 degrees, adduction to 10 degrees, external rotation to 20 degrees, and internal rotation to 10 degrees.  Range of motion of the left hip was estimated to be additionally limited as follows:  flexion to 40 degrees, extension to 5 degrees, abduction to 10 degrees, adduction to 10 degrees, external rotation to 20 degrees, and internal rotation to 10 degrees.  The examiner reported that, with repeated use over time and during flare-ups, limitation in adduction does prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  The examiner indicated that additional factors contributing to the Veteran's hip disabilities include interference with standing and disturbance of locomotion.  There was no muscle atrophy or ankylosis.  The Veteran does not use assistive devices for ambulation.  The examiner reported that the Veteran's right and left hip disabilities do impact his ability to perform occupational tasks; specifically, "[n]otes he cannot stand or walk longer than 30 minutes."

	Right hip

As indicated above, the Veteran's right hip disability is assigned a 20 percent rating for right hip impairment under DC 5253 from February 24, 2022 to July 19, 2022, 100 percent from July 19, 2022 to November 19, 2022, 20 percent from November 19, 2022 to September 1, 2023, zero percent from September 1, 2023 to September 11, 2023, and 20 percent from September 11, 2023.

He is also assigned a 10 percent disability rating for right hip limitation of extension under DC 5251 from December 2, 2019 to February 24, 2022, zero percent from February 24, 2022, and 10 percent from September 11, 2023.

With respect to the service-connected right hip impairment, the Board will herein consider whether entitlement to a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for the period dating from the December 24, 2022 increased rating claim to September 11, 2023, to include the one year look back period.  Given the ratings already assigned for the right hip impairment, and liberally interpreting Mr. Grove's limited argument, the Veteran essentially contends that a 20 percent disability rating is warranted for right hip impairment under DC 5253 from September 1, 2023 to September 11, 2023.  However, there are no VA or private treatment records corresponding to this period that document compensable right hip impairment based upon limitation of rotation, adduction, or abduction.  Moreover, as detailed above, the February 2023 VA examination report identified external rotation to 35 degrees, internal rotation to 20 degrees, abduction to 30 degrees, and adduction to 25 degrees.  The February 2023 VA examiner specifically indicated that the Veteran's right hip symptoms did not render him unable to cross his legs.  Accordingly, the Veteran's right hip disability did not demonstrate limitation of rotation of, inability to toe-out more than 15 degrees, or limitation of adduction rendering him unable to cross his legs, or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees during the period dating from September 1, 2023 to September 11, 2023, even considering active and passive motion, weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing, flare-ups, and repeated use over time.  Therefore, a compensable disability rating for right hip impairment under DC 5253 is not warranted for the period prior to September 11, 2023.

As to the right hip limitation of extension, the Board will herein consider whether entitlement to a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for the period dating from the December 24, 2022 increased rating claim to September 11, 2023, to include the one year look back period.  Given the ratings already assigned for the right hip limitation of extension, the Veteran is essentially contending that a 10 percent is warranted under DC 5251 for the period dated from February 24, 2022 to September 11, 2023.  To this end, there are no VA or private treatment records for this period that document compensable limitation of extension of the right hip.  Rather, the November 2022 and February 2023 VA examination reports documented right hip extension to, at worst, 10 degrees, even taking into consideration repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  Extension limited to 5 degrees, which would warrant a 10 percent rating under DC 5251, was not documented until the September 11, 2023 VA examination.  As extension was not limited to 5 degrees or less, or functional impairment more nearly approximating such, during active or passive motion, on weight-bearing or nonweight-bearing, during flare-ups, or with repeated use over time, a compensable disability rating for right hip limitation of extension under DC 5251 is not warranted for the period dating prior to September 11, 2023.

For the periods under consideration, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was right hip functional loss due to pain, including during flare-ups and with repetitive use over time with locking.  Critically, however, functional loss must be rated under the diagnostic code pertaining to limitation of motion of the affected joint, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 592 (1991) (noting that functional loss due to pain is to be rated at the same level as where motion is impeded); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-06 (1995) (noting that the disabling effect of painful motion must be considered when rating joint disabilities); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37 (2011) (stating that functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if that functional loss were caused by some other factor that actually limited motion)); c.f., Petitti v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 415 (2015).  Even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he experiences flare-ups with excessive walking or prolonged standing would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating extension limited to 5 degrees or limitation of rotation of, inability to toe-out more than 15 degrees, or limitation of adduction rendering him unable to cross his legs, or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees, which are the criteria for compensable disability ratings under DCs 5251 and 5253, respectively.

The Board reiterates that it has considered whether increased ratings for the Veteran's right hip disability may be effectuated during the one-year look back period under both DCs 5251 and 5253, but it is not factually ascertainable that any increase in severity specifically took place during that time period.  The Veteran does not specifically assert the worsening of his right hip symptoms occurred during the one-year period prior to his December 24, 2022 increased rating claim, and the evidence does not indicate such an increase occurred during that time period.

The clinical evidence of record reflects that, during the period under review, the Veteran has used over-the-counter Tylenol and Advil to manage his right hip pain.  The Court has held that, in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012).  Here, the applicable Diagnostic Codes do not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  The Board, however, notes that the record contains no indication, nor has the Veteran contended, that the medication he used resulted in ameliorative effects.  Rather, in the VA examinations conducted during the period on appeal, the Veteran has reported using Tylenol and Advil to help with his right hip pain, but he has not contended, nor does the record show, that this medication alleviated limitations with joint function.  The medical evidence of record also does not show that the Veteran's use of over-the-counter Tylenol has impacted the functional impairment manifested by his right hip disability, nor does the Veteran so contend.

For the reasons set forth above, the Board finds that the evidence substantially weighs against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 20 percent disability rating for right hip impairment and a 10 percent disability rating for right hip limitation of extension; as such, the claims are denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

	Left thigh

As indicated above, the Veteran's left thigh disability is assigned noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating for left thigh impairment under DC 5253 from February 24, 2022 to September 11, 2023, and a 20 percent rating from September 11, 2023.  He is also assigned a noncompensable (zero percent) disability rating for right hip limitation of extension under DC 5251 from February 24, 2022 to September 11, 2023 and 10 percent from September 11, 2023.

As indicated above, the date of the increased rating claim on appeal is December 24, 2022.  The Board will therefore consider whether entitlement to increased ratings for left thigh impairment (5253) and limitation of extension (5251) are warranted from December 24, 2022 to September 11, 2023, to include the one year look-back period, subject to the February 24, 2022 award of entitlement to service connection for the left thigh disabilities.

With respect to the left thigh impairment, the Veteran, through his representative, essentially asserts that a 20 percent rating is warranted for the period dating prior to September 11, 2023.  See the statement of the Veteran's representative dated October 2023.  To this end, the Board notes that treatment records and VA examination reports dated prior to September 11, 2023 did not document compensable right hip impairment based upon limitation of rotation, adduction, or abduction.  As detailed above, the November 2022 VA examination report documented, at worst, external rotation to 60 degrees, adduction to 20 degrees, and abduction to 25 degrees, even considering repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  The examiners also specifically indicated that limitation in adduction does not prevent the Veteran from crossing his legs.  In sum, the Veteran's left thigh disability did not demonstrate limitation of rotation of, inability to toe-out more than 15 degrees, limitation of adduction rendering him unable to cross his legs, or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees during the period dating prior to September 11, 2023, even considering active and passive motion, weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing, flare-ups, and repeated use over time.  Therefore, a compensable disability rating for left thigh impairment under DC 5253 is not warranted prior to September 11, 2023.

As to the left thigh limitation of extension, the Veteran, through his representative, essentially asserts that a 10 percent rating is warranted for the period dating prior to September 11, 2023.  See the statement of the Veteran's representative dated October 2023.  To this end, the Board notes that there are no VA or private treatment records dated prior to September 11, 2023, which document compensable limitation of extension of the left thigh.  In particular, the November 2022 and February 2023 VA examinations documented left hip extension to, at worst, 25 degrees, even taking into consideration repeated use over time and during flare-ups.  Extension limited to 5 degrees, sufficient to warrant a 10 percent rating under DC 5251, was not documented until the September 11, 2023 VA examination.  As extension was not limited to 5 degrees or less or functional impairment more nearly approximating such, during active or passive motion, on weight-bearing or nonweight-bearing, during flare-ups, or with repeated use over time, a compensable disability rating for left thigh limitation of extension under DC 5251 is not warranted prior to September 11, 2023.

For the periods under consideration, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was left thigh loss due to pain, including during flare-ups and with repetitive use over time.  However, functional loss must be rated under the diagnostic code pertaining to limitation of motion of the affected joint, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 592 (noting that functional loss due to pain is to be rated at the same level as where motion is impeded); DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 205-06 (noting that the disabling effect of painful motion must be considered when rating joint disabilities); Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 37 (stating that functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if that functional loss were caused by some other factor that actually limited motion)); c.f., Petitti, supra.  Even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements that he experiences flare-ups with excessive walking or prolonged standing would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating extension limited to 5 degrees or limitation of rotation of, inability to toe-out more than 15 degrees, limitation of adduction rendering him unable to cross his legs, or limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees, which are the criteria for compensable disability ratings under DCs 5251 and 5253, respectively.

The Board reiterates that it has considered whether increased ratings for the Veteran's left thigh disability may be effectuated during the one-year look back period under both DCs 5251 and 5253, but it is not factually ascertainable that any increase in severity specifically took place during that time period.  The Veteran does not specifically assert the worsening of his left thigh symptoms occurred during the one-year period prior to his December 24, 2022 increased rating claim (subject to the February 24, 2022 award of service connection for his left thigh disabilities), and the evidence does not indicate such an increase occurred during that time period.

The clinical evidence of record reflects that, during the period under review, the Veteran has used over-the-counter Tylenol and Advil to manage his left thigh pain.  As described above, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria, as in this case.  See Jones, 26 Vet. App. at 63.  In this matter, the applicable Diagnostic Codes do not consider the ameliorative effects of medication.  The Board notes that the record contains no indication, nor has the Veteran contended, that the medication he used resulted in ameliorative effects.  Rather, in the VA examinations conducted during the period on appeal, the Veteran has reported using Tylenol to help with his left thigh pain, but he has not contended that this medication helped with his left hip joint function.  The medical evidence of record also does not show that the Veteran's use of over-the-counter Tylenol and Advil has impacted the functional impairment manifested by his left thigh disability, nor does the Veteran so contend.

For the reasons set forth above, the Board finds that the evidence substantially weighs against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to an effective date prior to September 11, 2023 for the award of a 20 percent disability rating for left thigh impairment and a 10 percent disability rating for left thigh limitation of extension; as such, the claims are denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Lynch, supra.
