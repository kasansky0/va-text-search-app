2. There is no question of law or fact on appeal regarding the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for the award of SMC(s); the appeal must be dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1972 to May 1992.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) following his appeal of an October 2023 rating decision.

By way of background, in an April 2023 supplemental claim decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) found that new and relevant evidence had been submitted, readjudicated the claim for a higher initial rating for Meniere's syndrome, and increased the rating for that disability to 60 percent effective November 10, 2022. The Veteran requested higher-level review. An October 2023 higher-level review decision rated the Veteran's Meniere's syndrome as 100 percent disabling effective June 15, 2022, and granted SMC(s) and DEA eligibility effective the same date. The Veteran subsequently appealed in a January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), seeking an earlier effective date for the award of the 100 percent rating. In May 2024, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted an "addendum" Notice of Disagreement, requesting review of the effective dates assigned for the awards of SMC(s) and DEA eligibility in the October 2023 higher-level review decision in addition to the effective date awarded for the 100 percent rating for Meniere's syndrome.

In his May 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the April 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

1. The appeal for an earlier effective date for entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 is dismissed.

2. The appeal for an earlier effective date for entitlement to the award of SMC(s) is dismissed.

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Under 38 U.S.C. § 7105, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 

Here, a dismissal of these issues is required as a matter of law.

The October 2023 higher-level review decision on appeal rated the Veteran's Meniere's syndrome as 100 percent disabling effective June 15, 2022, and granted SMC(s) and DEA eligibility effective the same date.

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted a Notice of Disagreement appealing the effective date for the award of the 100 percent rating for Meniere's syndrome. The Board docketed the appeal under docket number 240103-406095. 

In May 2024, the Veteran, through his attorney, submitted an "addendum" Notice of Disagreement, requesting review of the effective dates assigned for the awards of SMC(s) and DEA eligibility in the October 2023 higher-level review decision in addition to the effective date awarded for the 100 percent rating for Meniere's syndrome. See May 1, 2024 VA Form 10182. The Board separately docketed the May 2024 appeal as to those issues (Board docket number 240501-436868). However, for purposes of efficiency, the Board added the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of the ancillary benefits of SMC(s) and DEA eligibility and addressed all three issues in its March 31, 2025 decision. As stated in that decision, the Board explained that it will dismiss this separately docketed appeal associated with the May 2024 addendum Notice of Disagreement (Board docket number 240501-436868), as those issues are entirely duplicative of the issues addressed in the March 31, 2025 decision docketed as 240103-406095. In addition, entitlement to the ancillary benefits sought was granted in full in the March 31, 2025, rendering this appeal moot.

Because the March 31, 2025 Board decision fully adjudicated the issues of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of the ancillary benefits of SMC(s) and DEA eligibility and awarded those benefits in full, and the issues on appeal here are entirely duplicative, there remains no final action by the AOJ for the Veteran to appeal. There are no questions of fact or law to be decided by the Board in connection with this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104(a). Accordingly, the appeals of an earlier effective date for entitlement to basic eligibility for DEA and an earlier effective date for entitlement to the award of SMC(s), are dismissed as moot. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
