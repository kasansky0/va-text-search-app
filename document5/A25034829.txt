REMANDED

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than August 10, 2022 for service connection for prostate cancer is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served active duty in the United States Navy from January 1973 to January 1993. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In July 2024, the Veteran disagreed with the decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and electing direct review by a Veterans Law Judge under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system. 

As the appellant has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.  The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the notice of disagreement, known under the AMA system as the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. The appellant is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered.  Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).

The Board notes that an appeal may not be decided prior to the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows claimants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within one year from the date the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from when the Board receives the NOD, whichever is later; unless a claimant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Hence, there is no prejudicial error in this case as the matter is being remanded for additional development to prevent further delay of its adjudication.

Upon review of the claims file, the Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error has occurred that requires remand of the claim.

The RO decision that granted service connection for prostate cancer, effective August 10, 2022 shows the date of the award was based on the enactment and effective date of the PACT Act.  Although service connection for prostate cancer is granted on a presumptive basis under the PACT Act, the Board acknowledges that the effective date of such award can be no earlier than August 10, 2022, the date of enactment of the PACT Act.  However, VA has a duty to maximize benefits, and a grant of service connection on another basis other than under the PACT Act may provide the Veteran an earlier effective date.  Therefore, this means alternate theories of entitlement to service connection must be explored for the period prior to the effective date of the PACT Act. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

While the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2023, pursuant to a January 2023 Board remand, the AOJ did not obtain a medical opinion that addressed whether the Veteran's prostate cancer was directly related to his military service under another basis besides presumptively under the PACT Act.  For this reason, remand is necessary for an opinion that addresses other theories of entitlement.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should obtain an opinion from an appropriately qualified clinician to determine whether the Veteran's prostate cancer had its onset during active duty service or was otherwise etiologically related to service, to include his exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, including plastics, resins, solvents, fuels, oil, asbestos, and fiberglass while performing the duties of repairing and refurbishing nuclear submarines.

In providing the above opinion, the examiner should consider the Veteran's assertions of exposure.  The Board advises the examiner that, while service connection has already been presumptively service connected under the PACT Act, an opinion is needed to address whether the prostate cancer was directly caused by exposure (outside of presumptive connection), warranting an earlier effective date for service connection.  Therefore, the question the examiner is requested to answer is whether the Veteran's prostate cancer was caused by active duty service, despite being presumptively service connected, prior to August 10, 2022.

A complete rationale with discussion of medical literature for any opinion expressed must be provided. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, discuss why this is the case.
