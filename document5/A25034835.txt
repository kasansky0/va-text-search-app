ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for right ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his right ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation were aggravated beyond its natural progression during active service.

2. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, his left ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation were aggravated beyond its natural progression during active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306.

2. The criteria for service connection for left ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.306.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1995 to April 2019.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2020 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In March 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2019 decision.  In July 2020, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2019 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2019 decision.

In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2019 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for right ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation

The Veteran seeks service connection for hearing disabilities in both ears.  Because each ear shares similar history and symptoms as the other, both ears will be discussed simultaneously.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

A Veteran is presumed to have been sound upon entry into the military, except as to conditions noted at the time of the acceptance, examination, or enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the condition existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.  38 U.S.C. § 1111; Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury not noted upon entry to service manifests in service, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service.  Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012), aff'd 749 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

The burden falls on VA to rebut the presumption of soundness by clear and unmistakable evidence that an injury or disease manifested in service was both preexisting and not aggravated by service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1111; Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.  Clear and unmistakable evidence means that the evidence cannot be misinterpreted and misunderstood, i.e., it is undebatable.  Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009).  Clear and unmistakable evidence can consist of the Veteran's own admissions of a preservice disability.  Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 237 (2012).  If there is clear and unmistakable evidence to show that the Veteran's disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service, then the Veteran is not entitled to service-connected benefits for the preexisting condition.  Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.

In the July 2020 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the claimed conditions existed prior to military service, were treated during service, and that the Veteran had a current disability of eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation.  Any finding favorable to the claimant made by a VA adjudicator is binding on all subsequent agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless the favorable finding is rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding.  38 U.S.C. § 3.104(c).  Because the favorable findings are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous, the Board will not disturb them, and the only issue remains is whether the Veteran's ear disabilities were aggravated during service.

Prior to service, the Veteran had suffered from chronic otitis media and had pressure equalization tubes (PETs) inserted in both ears.  These procedures occurred in 1978, 1980, and 1989.  See May 2019 STR.  As part of the enlistment process, the Veteran submitted a letter from a private ENT specialist indicating that despite his ear trouble, the Veteran would not experience difficulty undertaking military service.  The physician further indicated that they would not expect any change in the Veteran's ear condition.  Id.

The Veteran's entrance examination indicated that he suffered from hearing loss prior to enlistment.  The enlistment audiogram showed left conductive hearing loss.  The medical records indicated that the Veteran experienced trauma to his right ear in 1998.  The Veteran experienced left tympanic membrane perforation in 2000 and 2002, undergoing a tympanoplasty and PET tube placement in 2005.  A left stapedectomy occurred in 2006 and was repeated some years later followed by the same procedure on the right side.  See May 2019 STR.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with this claim.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's ear conditions existed prior to service and progressively worsened during service.  However, the examiner concluded that the progression was not beyond the natural progression of the disease.  As rationale, the examiner noted that there was no injury or illness during service that would worsen the Veteran's condition, and that the Veteran's condition developed due to the "inherent characteristics of his auditory system."  See June 2019 C&P Exam.

As previously stated, the VA has the burden to prove that the Veteran's ear disabilities were not aggravated beyond the natural progression of the disease during service.  The Board finds that the VA examination report does not meet this burden.  

The report suffers from several defects.  First, the report does not acknowledge that the Veteran suffered trauma to both ears during service, as indicated by service treatment records.  In fact, the examiner incorrectly stated that no injuries occurred during service.  Second, the report does not explain how eustachian tube dysfunction naturally progresses into otosclerosis, which required stapedectomies and other interventions, when the Veteran's own physician stated that no further progression was expected.  Rather, the report simply states a conclusion without providing a medical explanation.  

The Board finds that the Veteran's eustachian tube dysfunction existed prior to service and progressively worsened during service.  Further, the Board finds that the VA has failed to meet its burden of proving that the Veteran's condition was not aggravated beyond its natural progression during service.  The presumption of aggravation applies.  Therefore, entitlement to service connection for left and right ear eustachian tube dysfunction, otosclerosis, residuals of stapedectomy, and tympanic membrane perforation is warranted.
