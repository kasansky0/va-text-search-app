FINDING OF FACT

In January 2024, VA was notified that the Veteran had died in December 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from June 1968 to April 1970.

1. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, left upper extremity

2. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, right lower extremity

3. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, right upper extremity

4. Entitlement to service connection for peripheral neuropathy, left lower extremity

These matters are on appeal from an October 2022 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim(s) at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

Here, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
