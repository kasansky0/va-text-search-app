REMANDED

Service connection for chronic kidney disease, to include as secondary to diabetes mellitus, and as due to exposure to herbicide agents and contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1974 to May 1978; he also has service in the Marine Corps Reserve.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket. See July 2024 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the rating decision on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window. However, as this matter is being remanded, the AOJ will consider the issue in light of the entire claims file upon remand.

As a final preliminary matter, the Board notes that this decision is being issued while the Veteran still has the right to modify his VA Form 10182 and change to another evidentiary window option. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see also Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, as the claim is being remanded for further development, the Board finds it would be more prejudicial for the Board to delay remanding the claim.

Service connection for chronic kidney disease, to include as secondary to diabetes mellitus, and as due to exposure to herbicide agents and contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, is remanded.

Of note, the Veteran expanded his claim of service connection for kidney disease to include due to herbicide exposure in addition to due to water contamination at Camp Lejeune. See July 2018 VA Form 21-0820; see also August 2018 Medical Treatment Record. 

The Board finds it necessary to remand this matter to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the issuance of the May 2024 rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 20.802.

VA failed to fully develop the record relating to the Veteran's assertions about his exposures to herbicides during service. In January 2004, he asserted that he was indirectly exposed to herbicide agents. See April 1982 VA Form 21-4138. He was a diesel mechanic and worked on all equipment coming out of Vietnam while stationed at Camp Pendleton. See also October 2012 SHARE Print Screens; October 2012 VA Form 21-4138. In May 2012, he reported direct exposure to Agent Orange while stationed in Okinawa, Japan between 1976 and 1977. See May 2012 NOD. He was the non-commissioned officer of the decontamination team in charge of disposing of Agent Orange; he put it in a one and a half deep [ditch]. See September 2012 & October 2012 VA Form 21-4138.

In an October 2012 Memorandum, VA noted it was unable to concede herbicide exposure because the Veteran failed to provide sufficient information to research his claimed exposures. See October 2012 VA Memo. VA placed additional research requests in June 2016, July 2016, October 2016, and December 2016. See June 2016 Email Correspondence; July 2016 & October 2016 Correspondences. In a December 2016 response, VA was directed to contact the Joint Services Records Research Center (JSRRC) Coordinator at the local VARO station to complete the research. See December 2016 Email Correspondence. In February 2017, VA received multiple documents addressing toxic contamination on Okinawa. See December 2016 VA Form 21-0820; February 2017 Correspondence. Due to confusion as to whether VA had conceded to herbicide exposure, VA sent an additional research request in December 2018. See October 2018 & December 2018 Email Correspondences. 

In a December 2018 response, the JSRRC again stated that it does not research Marine Corps records and directed VA to contact the Marine Corps Gray Research Center (Quantico, VA) or National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) (College Park, MD). However, there is no evidence that VA sent a request to the Marine Corps Gray Research Center or NARA to research the Veteran's claims about his exposure to Agent Orange while stationed at Camp Pendleton and at Camp Schwab in Okinawa.

Moreover, it is unclear to the Board what exposures VA has conceded. The claims file shows that, in October 2012, VA declined to concede the Veteran was exposed to or served in a location for presumptive exposure to an herbicide agent under 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). See October 2012 VA Memo. However, a March 2017 rating decision awarded service connection on a presumptive basis for diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy secondary to herbicide exposure during service.  

In the December 2018 research response, VA acknowledged the use of commercial herbicides on all military bases worldwide but that commercial herbicides do not fall under the regulations governing presumptions related to specifically designated herbicides, such as Agent Orange. See January 2019 Email Correspondence. "All evidence shows that any herbicide use the claimant or others observed, or were associated with, was the commercial variety, not Agent Orange." Of note, VA severed service connection for the diabetes mellitus and peripheral neuropathy in an April 2019 rating decision because VA had been unable to verify exposure to Agent Orange during service.

Between June 2023 and April 2024, VA issued five toxic exposure risk activities (TERA) Memorandums. An April 2023 memorandum identified that the Veteran qualified for presumptive non-deployment related exposure to water contamination at Camp Lejeune (December 13, 1977, to May 5, 1978). See April 2023 TERA Memorandum (Other). An August 2023 memorandum amended the dates of exposure (exposure started on January 18, 1978). See August 2023 TERA Memorandum (Other). Two weeks later, 2 separate memorandums were issued. See August 2023 TERA Memorandums (Other). One document, the response to Question 5A reads, "MPR rcvd 10/17/2016 CAMP SCHWAB OKINAWA 12/1976-11/1977". The second document identifies that the Veteran qualifies for presumptive exposure to water contamination at Camp Lejeune and also herbicide agent exposure based on his service at Camp Schwab. No other changes were made. In the April 2024 memorandum, VA noted only that the Veteran qualified for presumptive exposure to water contamination at Camp Lejeune. See April 2024 TERA Memorandum (Other). The response to Question 5A is negative. Question 6 discusses only the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) as a vehicle repairman.

The Board recognizes that the claims file raises an alternative theory of entitlement - service connection on a secondary basis. Both the October 2017 and February 2024 VA medical opinions point out that the Veteran has risk factors for kidney disease, including diabetes mellitus (the number 1 cause of kidney disease). See October 2017 & April 2024 C&P Exams. The Board takes administrative notice that the Veteran has a pending claim to reestablish service connection for diabetes mellitus. A request to research the claimed in-service exposures and clarification about which exposures the VA concedes to is needed before the Board can address all theories of entitlement raised, including consideration as to whether service connection is warranted on a facts-found basis. Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1038, 1042 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Upon remand, the AOJ will request the Marine Corps Gray Research Center, NARA, and/or any other appropriate agency research the Veteran's claims relating to his exposure to herbicides or other heavy metals while stationed at Camp Pendleton and Camp Schwab and clarify VA's position as to which exposures it is or is not conceding to.

Additionally, an addendum VA medical opinion is needed. When VA undertakes to provide a veteran with an examination or obtain a medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination and/or opinion is adequate and addresses all relevant theories of entitlement. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). 

In February 2024, consistent with the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), the AOJ requested a TERA medical opinion addressing whether the kidney disease was at least as likely as not "caused by (the) exposure to contaminated water while stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran". See February 2024 Exam Request. In the February 2024 medical opinion, the VA examiner opined that the kidney disease was less likely than not "caused by the indicated [TERAs], after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran." See April 2024 C&P Exam. The examiner concluded that the etiology of the condition was hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus, and that literature did not support a nexus based on toxic exposure. Of note, the examiner failed to provide a response to list all types of known exposures.

The opinion is conclusory and incomplete. The examiner merely concluded that literature does not support a nexus without providing citations to such literature. It is unclear if the examiner was informed that VA had also conceded to exposures related to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS). The request for the medical opinion was sent prior to the April 2024 TERA Memorandum and there is nothing to indicate VA requested an addendum opinion to include MOS-related exposures.

Upon remand, the AOJ will obtain an addendum VA medical opinions addressing service connection for kidney disease on direct and secondary bases that are factually accurate, fully articulated, and of sound reasoning. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?295, 304 (2008); Stefl?v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?120, 124 (2007). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send a research request to Marine Corps Gray Research Center, NARA, and/or another appropriate agency to verify the Veteran's assertions that he was directly exposed to an herbicide agent while stationed at Camp Pendleton and deployed to Camp Schwab in Okinawa, Japan. The response should clearly identify each base and/or camp the Veteran or his unit were assigned to, the dates of the assignments, and all exposures at all assigned bases or camps, to include commercial herbicides and heavy metals.

2. When the above directive has been completed, obtain an addendum medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the kidney disease. The need for an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner. The examiner must review the entire claims file, including a copy of this remand, and note such in the accompanying report.

3. The examiner is asked to opine on the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (i.e., likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the kidney disease is etiologically related to an injury, event, or illness during service, to include but not limited to exposure to an herbicide agent, contaminated water, heavy metals, or an exposure consistent with the Veteran's military occupational specialty?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not that the kidney disease is due to or aggravated by another condition, to include diabetes mellitus?

The examiner should be reminded that while the kidney disease is not listed as a presumptive disease due to exposure to an herbicide agent or contaminated water at Camp Lejeune (which addresses kidney cancer), service connection may still be established through proof of direct contact.

Under Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2023), when evaluating whether a condition was aggravated by another condition, the Veteran need only show that there was an incremental increase in severity of the alleged disability and that the increase in severity would not have occurred "but for" the service-connected disability.

The examiner must provide a thorough rationale for all opinions and conclusions expressed and cite to supporting clinical data and/or medical literature as appropriate. The examiner should also address the Veteran's lay statements regarding the claimed exposures and history of symptomology. 

Because the Veteran is competent to attest to factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge, including observable symptomatology, the examiner should provide a well-reasoned explanation if there is a medical basis that supports or calls into doubt the Veteran's reported history of his symptoms or if an alleged disability is more likely than not related to an intercurrent cause.

If any examiner is unable to provide an opinion, the examiner should indicate whether there is any additional evidence that would facilitate an opinion, or whether the examiner's inability to opine is based on the limits of the examiner's medical knowledge.
