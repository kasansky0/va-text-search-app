FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The issue of service connection for erectile dysfunction was previously denied in an August 2014 rating decision.

3. The December 19, 2023, rating decision granted service connection for erectile dysfunction and included an award of special monthly compensation based on the loss of use of a creative organ.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility for attorney fees associated with past due benefits awarded in the December 19, 2023, rating decision have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1965 to November 1968 with a period of active duty for training from May 1965 to October 1965.  The appellant, A.P.G., was the Veteran's attorney during periods pertinent to this appeal.

The fee decision on appeal (Summary of the Case) was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket. The Veteran did not elect to change the docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 fee decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301, 20.405.  Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

This case involves a simultaneously contested claim; therefore, the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 7105A are applicable. Cases involving simultaneously contested claims are also subject to special procedural regulations. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400, 20.401, 20.402, 20.403, 20.404, 20.405, 20.406, 20.407. Specifically, 38 C.F.R. § 20.400 provides that, in a simultaneously contested claim, all interested parties are to be notified of the action taken by the AOJ and of the right and time limit for initiating an appeal, as well as notification of the right to a hearing and representation. Upon the filing of a notice of disagreement, all interested parties will be furnished a copy of the substance of the notice of disagreement, including what type of review was selected and whether a hearing was requested. 38 C.F.R. § 20.403.

The foregoing procedures were satisfied by letters to each party dated in December 2023, January 2024, and March 2025.

Eligibility for attorney fees associated with past due benefits awarded in the December 19, 2023, rating decision

The appellant disagrees with the denial of attorney fees in the December 2023 fee decision.  

The December 2023 fee decision denied fees because the notice of initial decision associated with the supplemental claim was not issued on or after the effective date of the modernized review system under 38 CFR 19.2(a)(February 19, 2019) and 38 CFR 14.636(c)(1)(i). The provisions of 38 CFR 14.636(c)(2)(i) apply.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904.

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22 or VA Form 21-22a, is required to represent a claimant before VA. The power of attorney shall contain the signature of the claimant and the signature of the agent or attorney and shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631 (f)(1).

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following: the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (c)(1).

A supplemental claim filed more than a year after the initial rating decision is part of the original case, and an attorney may charge fees for representation provided in filing that supplemental claim. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4 th 1110, 1138-41 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  That decision invalidated 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(c)(1)(i) as contrary with the plain and ordinary meaning of 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1).  

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904 (d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636 (h)(1), 14.636(h)(2).

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded based on a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636 (h)(3)(i).

Fees are not payable for an award resulting from the initial decision in an increased rating claim. See Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024).

In this case, the attorney has complied with regulatory POA and fee agreement requirements. See 38 U.S.C. § 5904.  Specifically, the Veteran and the appellant executed a November 2022 VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative." At that same time, the parties executed a direct pay fee agreement which provided that the appellant was entitled to fees in the amount of 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee was to be paid directly by VA to the appellant. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his representative and the associated fee agreement are valid.

The Board now turns to whether the appellant is otherwise eligible to charge fees.  The issue in the case is whether the December 2023 rating decision is the initial decision with respect to the case.  The Board finds that it is a decision rendered after the initial decision with respect to the case.

The December 2023 rating decision granted service connection for erectile dysfunction and granted special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ.

The issue of service connection for erectile dysfunction was previously denied in an August 2014 rating decision.  In February 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (supplemental claim) seeking to reopen the claim of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  That claim led to the award of benefits in December 2023.

The Board finds that the August 2014 rating decision was the initial decision with respect to the case.  The regulation the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) relied upon to deny benefits has been invalidated, as stated above.  The Board knows of no statute or regulation that limits entitlement to fees only to supplemental claims on decisions issued after the effective date of the AMA.  Consequently, fees are warranted.
