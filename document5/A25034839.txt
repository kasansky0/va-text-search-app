DOCKET NO. 240303-421925
DATE: April 15, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraine including migraine variants (migraines) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew his appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraines.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraines, by the Veteran, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2017 to November 2021.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative and must include the name of the Veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  Id.  Here, an October 2024 VA Form 27-0820, Report of General Information, memorializes, in writing, a phone call received from the Veteran.  Specifically, the Report of General Information reflects the Veteran's name, VA file number, and that the Veteran was requesting to cancel his appeal with the BVA, docket number D240303-421925 so that he could file a supplemental claim.  

The Board acknowledges that, in March 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking him to clarify whether it was his intent to withdraw his appeal before the Board.  The Veteran did not respond to this letter.  However, upon further review, the Board finds that the October 2024 VA Form 27-0820 reflects that the Veteran explicitly withdrew the issue of entitlement to service connection for migraines.  Thus, the Veteran's withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for migraines was effective in October 2024.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(3) ("An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board.")

Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal and it is dismissed.
