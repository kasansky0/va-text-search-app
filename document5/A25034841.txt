Entitlement to an effective date of May 11, 2022, though no earlier, for the award of special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively supports that allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, and sinusitis have not been shown during the pendency of the appeal, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

2. The evidence persuasively supports that a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes has not been shown during the pendency of the appeal, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor. 

3. The evidence persuasively supports that a heart condition did not originate in service or for many years thereafter and is not related to any incident during active service, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

4. The evidence persuasively supports that tinnitus did not originate in service or for many years thereafter and is not related to any incident during active service, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

5. The evidence persuasively supports that sleep apnea did not originate in service or for many years thereafter and is not related to any incident during active service, and therefore there is no benefit of the doubt to resolve in the Veteran's favor.

6. In a June 2009 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to service connection for a post concussion headache and assigned a disability rating from August 1, 2008, which is still currently in effect, and as such, there is no unresolved question of law or fact in this matter before the Board. 

7. The probative evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain, at worst, has been productive of flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, objective evidence of pain but no additional limitation, no additional limitation with observed repetitive use, repetitive use over time or flare ups, no localized tenderness or guarding resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; there were no findings of flexion limited between 30 to 60 degrees or 30 degrees or less, favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine or the entire spine, or incapacitating episodes in a 12 month period.

8. The probative evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's cervical spondyloarthropathy, at worst, has been productive of pain and limitation of flexion to 40 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, and pain with range of motion, pain limiting motion to 35 degrees of flexion with repetitive use over time, and no reports of flare ups; there have been no findings of incapacitating episodes or ankylosis, favorable or unfavorable, of the cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine or entire spine.

9. The probative evidence demonstrates that erectile dysfunction was initially diagnosed in March 2009 and the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction on June 8, 2023; prior to this date, there was no pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction.

10. The probative evidence demonstrates that low back pain was initially diagnosed in October 2015 and the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for back pain on May 11, 2023; prior to this date, there was no pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection for lumbosacral strain or other low back disability.

11. The Veteran's claim for an effective date prior to May 11, 2023, for the assignment of a 10 percent disability rating for cervical spine disability constitutes a "freestanding" earlier effective date claim. 

12. For the period from May 11, 2022, within a year of the claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's psychiatric disability, it was factually ascertainable that his bipolar I disorder with anxious distress with rapid cycling with mood-congruent psychotic features, most recent episode depressed, and TBI warranted a disability rating of 100 percent. 

13. For the period from May 11, 2022, the Veteran had a single service-connected disability rated as totally disabling, namely, the service-connected psychiatric disability has been awarded 100 percent back to May 11, 2022, in this decision, and additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2006 to July 2008.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, for all the claims except for the effective date claim for erectile dysfunction, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the November 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error for the claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for erectile dysfunction, which considered additional evidence following the August 2023 rating decision, including a January 2024 VA examination of the male genitourinary system and a January 2024 VA opinion. The Veteran subsequently appealed the January 2024 decision regarding the effective date awarded for erectile dysfunction. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 decision. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

1. Service Connection for Allergic Rhinitis

2. Service Connection for GERD

3. Service Connection for Hypertension

4. Service Connection for Sinusitis

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, there were no favorable findings for allergic rhinitis, GERD or sinusitis in the December 2023 rating decision. The December 2023 rating decision did include a favorable finding for the issue of service connection for hypertension, including that elevated blood pressure was noted in service. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran has not had a current diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, GERD, sinusitis, or hypertension at any time during the pendency of the claims. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Service treatment records (STRs) are negative for any complaints, findings or treatment for allergies, gastrointestinal or esophageal problems or sinus problems. While a July 2007 STR noted blood pressure was slightly elevated, neither high blood pressure, nor hypertension were noted or diagnosed. A subsequent January 2008 STR noted the Veteran underwent a full cardiology evaluation in October 2007 which found that he had a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise.

Post-service medical records reflect no diagnoses of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis at any time throughout the duration of the appeal. Private treatment reports from January 2008 and from July 2020 to October 2020 and VA outpatient treatment reports from March 2009 and from July 2015 to August 2023 reflect no findings, complaints or diagnoses of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007). VA outpatient treatment reports from July 2015 to August 2023 reflect the Veteran had continually reported having no known allergies, denied rhinorrhea in October 2016, and reported having no nausea, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, and no change in bowel habits in May 2016.

The Board notes that the record is absent of any service or post-service medical records showing any diagnoses of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis. However, the Board notes that consideration of the functional impairment of earning capacity resulting from the Veteran's claimed disabilities must be given if no diagnosis is of record. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The Board finds the available evidence of record does not show symptoms of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis that have impaired the Veteran's ability to perform occupational tasks. Thus, the Veteran's claimed disabilities have not demonstrated functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1368.

Regarding the Veteran's allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, and sinusitis, aside from the Veteran's bare assertion of entitlement to service connection for these conditions as several of a number of claimed conditions on his June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, he has made no other statements concerning these conditions. Thus, the Veteran's claimed disabilities have not demonstrated functional impairment of earning capacity. Saunders, 886 F.3d at 1368.

While the Veteran is competent to report past treatment and lay observations, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and knowledge of bodily systems. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence which does not demonstrate a current diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis during the period of the appeal. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was not afforded an examination in connection with the claims for service connection for allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis. VA's duty to assist requires provision of an examination when there is a current disability, an injury in service, and a possible nexus between them. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. §3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). However, the probative evidence does not establish a threshold requirement of service connection. Thus, the Board finds a VA examination was not required in connection with these claims, as there was no competent evidence during the period of review, lay or medical, of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability. As such, a VA examination is not warranted for these claims. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997). During the period on appeal, the evidence of record did not demonstrate any confirmed diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis at any time during the period of the appeal. In this case, entitlement to service connection for allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis cannot be established without the requested medical evidence. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Without competent evidence of a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis, the Board must deny the Veteran's claims. The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against the claims for service connection for allergic rhinitis, GERD, hypertension, or sinusitis, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Service Connection for Bilateral Hearing Loss

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the December 2023 rating decision included a favorable finding that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's active service, specifically noting that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was that of a motor vehicle operator, which has a moderate probability of noise exposure. See DD Form 214.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland (MD) CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects his MOS was that of a motor vehicle operator, which, as noted above, the RO found to support exposure to excessive noise during active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). 

During the pendency of the appeal, there have been no auditory thresholds in any of the relevant frequencies at 40 decibels or greater, there were not three frequencies at greater than 26 decibels for the left ear, and the speech recognition score was above 94 percent, thereby not meeting the criteria to qualify as a hearing loss disability for VA compensation purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The results of the audiometric testing in the July 2023 VA examination are as follows: 

			HERTZ		

					

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	10	10	15	10

LEFT	15	10	10	15	15

Speech discrimination scores using the MD CNC word recognition list revealed findings of 100 percent in both ears. 

During this examination, the Veteran reported having pre-military noise exposure of concerts, power tools, motor sports, chain saws, and wood working and stated that hearing protection was not used. He reported that pre-military, he worked in a marina. The Veteran reported serving in the Marines, with service during Afghan War and Iraq War, although he did not participate in combat activity. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran had an MOS of 3531 Motor Vehicle Operator, which had a moderate probability of hazardous noise exposure, and he also noted the Veteran had a Rifle Qualification Badge Marksman. The VA examiner then was noted to have been exposed to Humvees, 7-ton trucks, power tools, M16's, 249SAW's, M4's, MK19's and M203's. The Veteran stated that he shot with his right hand. His post-military noise exposure included heavy machinery, concerts, power tools, chain saws, and wood working, and he stated that hearing protection was not used. His post-military occupation was installing custom glass showers. The VA examiner concluded there was no diagnosis because there were no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis for either the right ear or left ear.

The VA examiner opined there were no findings, signs and/or symptoms to support a diagnosis of right or left ear hearing loss. He found that the Veteran had normal hearing (i.e. 25dB HL or less thresholds) from 250-8000Hz in both ears with excellent word recognition, so an etiology for right ear or left ear hearing loss is obviously not applicable.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; see Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F. 3d 1328, 1332 (1997). Here, the VA hearing examination findings are not sufficient to establish a current right or left ear hearing loss disability during the period on appeal for VA purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. During the period on appeal, the evidence of record demonstrated the Veteran was evaluated to have normal hearing in both ears by a VA examiner. In the absence of proof of a current disability, there can be no valid claim. Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

While the Veteran is competent to report his observations of hearing loss, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education and knowledge of bodily systems. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence which does not demonstrate a current diagnosis of hearing loss in either ear for VA purposes. 

Without competent evidence of a diagnosis of a bilateral hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, the Board must deny the Veteran's claim. The Board concludes that, as the evidence persuasively favors against service connection for bilateral hearing loss, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

6. Service Connection for Heart Condition

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision include that the claimed heart disability was a chronic disease which may be presumptively linked to service and that the Veteran met the minimum service requirements for presumptive service connection. The August 2023 rating decision for which higher-level review was sought also had the favorable finding that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability, specifically, a diagnosis of syncope and collapse noted in VA outpatient treatment records. 

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current disability of syncope and marked sinus bradycardia, noted in an October 2015 VA outpatient treatment report, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that such began during service or was otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service treatment records (STRs) reflect no findings, complaints, or diagnoses of any heart or cardiovascular problems at any time during the Veteran's active service. In a January 2008 STR, the Veteran underwent a full cardiology evaluation in October 2007 pursuant to being hospitalized for headaches and neurological problems. At that time, he was found to have a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise.

Post service treatment records, including private medical records from January 2008 and from July 2020 to October 2020 and VA medical records from March 2009 and from July 2015 to August 2023 reflect that the Veteran has been treated for and diagnosed with syncope and sinus bradycardia in October 2015 VA outpatient treatment reports.

The Board observes that there is no evidence of a nexus between the currently diagnosed syncope and sinus bradycardia and the Veteran's active service. The evidence of record does not demonstrate any medical opinions relating the current disability to the Veteran's active service, and the medical evidence of record does not demonstrate a continuity of treatment or symptoms. In a May 2009 VA general medical examination, an evaluation of cardiac symptoms found there was no congestive heart failure, no heart disease or hypertension, no angina, no history of syncope, no dyspnea, no fatigue, and no dizziness. No cardiac disabilities were diagnosed at that time.

While a Veteran is competent to report treatment and symptoms of a disorder, he is not competent to diagnose or medically attribute any in-service symptom or incident to a current disorder. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any cardiac symptoms began during his active service or have continued since that time. The issues are medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran to relate the current disabilities to active service in this case, as such would constitute a medical conclusion, which the Veteran is not competent to make as a lay person. See id. Regarding presumptive service connection or service connection based on continuity of symptomatology, the Board reiterates that the medical and lay evidence does not show that the Veteran's heart disability manifested within one year of discharge or that he experienced it continuously since service. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was not afforded an examination in connection with the claim for service connection for a heart disability. VA's duty to assist requires provision of an examination when there is a current disability, an injury in service, and a possible nexus between them. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). However, the probative evidence does not establish a threshold requirement of service connection. Thus, the Board finds a VA examination was not required in connection with this claim, as there was no competent evidence during the period of review, lay or medical, of any symptoms or complaints during service. As such, a VA examination is not warranted for this claim.

As the evidence persuasively favors against the claim for service connection for a heart condition, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for a heart condition is denied.

7. Service Connection for Tinnitus

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision includes that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability, specifically, as the July 2023 VA examination diagnosed the Veteran with tinnitus. In addition, the December 2023 rating decision found the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during active service, noting that his MOS of motor vehicle operator had a moderate probability of noise exposure. 

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosed disability of tinnitus, noted in a July 2023 VA examination, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that such began during service or was otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

The Veteran's DD Form 214 reflects his MOS was that of a motor vehicle operator, which, as noted above, the RO found to support exposure to excessive noise during active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1154. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see also Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). 

STRs reflect no findings, complaints, or diagnoses of any hearing or tinnitus problems at any time during the Veteran's active service. 

Post service treatment records, including private medical records from January 2008 and from July 2020 to October 2020 and VA medical records from March 2009 and from July 2015 to August 2023 do not reflect that the Veteran has been treated for tinnitus. Although a May 2009 VA general medical examination noted the Veteran reported a history of right ear hearing loss, a physical examination at that time revealed grossly normal hearing and normal tympanic membranes in both ears. Moreover, the Board observes that there were no complaints of tinnitus or a ringing or buzzing in either ear at that time. 

The Board observes that there is no evidence of a nexus between the currently diagnosed tinnitus and the Veteran's active service. The evidence of record does not demonstrate any medical opinions relating the current disability to the Veteran's active service, and the medical evidence of record does not demonstrate a continuity of treatment or symptoms. In the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus. At that time, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus began "at least a year ago," and the circumstance of the onset of tinnitus was unknown. The VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was a result of military noise exposure. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran reported that tinnitus started at least a year ago, about 14 years after his separation in July 2008. She cited to the study called "Implications for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus" (2005), noting that there was a possibility of a delay in onset of tinnitus due to noise exposure. She noted that this study stated that "as the interval between a noise exposure and the onset of tinnitus lengthens, the possibility that tinnitus will be triggered by other factors increases [and that a] more complete understanding of the mechanisms by which tinnitus is generated will be needed before the existence of delayed onset of noise-induced tinnitus can be confirmed or rejected." In so finding, the VA examiner noted, that tinnitus due to noise exposure or acoustic trauma was known to have a noticeable onset immediately or soon following the incident; however, the Veteran reported the onset of tinnitus was many years after leaving military service. Therefore, she concluded that it was less likely than not that tinnitus was caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The Board assigns high probative weight to this medical opinion, as the examiner reviewed the record, considered the Veteran's lay statements, cited to medical literature, and provided an adequate rationale for the conclusion.

While a Veteran is competent to report treatment and symptoms of a disorder, he is not competent to diagnose or medically attribute any in-service symptom or incident to a current disorder. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any tinnitus symptoms began during his active service or have continued since that time. The issues are medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran to relate the current tinnitus to active service in this case, as such would constitute a medical conclusion, which the Veteran is not competent to make as a lay person. See id. Regarding presumptive service connection or service connection based on continuity of symptomatology, the Board reiterates that the medical and lay evidence does not show that the Veteran's tinnitus manifested within one year of discharge or that he experienced it continuously since service.

As the evidence persuasively favors against the claim for service connection for a tinnitus, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus is denied.

8. Service Connection for Sleep Apnea

In light of the regulations governing the AMA review system, the Board is bound by the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2(d). In this case, the favorable findings in the December 2023 rating decision includes that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability, specifically, as VA treatment records noted a diagnosis of sleep apnea. 

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current disability of sleep apnea, noted in VA medical records and an October 2020 private treatment report, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that such began during service or was otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Service treatment records (STRs) reflect no findings, complaints, or diagnoses of any sleep apnea problems at any time during the Veteran's active service. In August 2007 and September 2007, the Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia; however, there was no indication that a sleep study was necessary or that there was possible sleep apnea.

Post service treatment records, including private medical records from January 2008 and from July 2020 to October 2020 and VA medical records from March 2009 and from July 2015 to August 2023 reflect that the Veteran has been treated for and diagnosed with sleep apnea. The Veteran initially reported he may have been experiencing symptoms of sleep apnea in an October 2015 VA outpatient treatment report, which was confirmed by a sleep study with an initial diagnosis in an October 2020 private treatment report. A March 2009 VA outpatient treatment report reflects the Veteran was diagnosed with insomnia related to traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, no complaints or findings of sleep apnea were noted at that time and a physical examination revealed normal ear, nose and throat as well as respiratory systems. In a May 2009 VA general medical examination, although the Veteran reported having a history of sleep impairment, being unable to sleep for more than four hours, and that he had trouble falling asleep, these were noted as psychiatric symptoms. During this VA examination, he also reported no history of sleep apnea symptoms and there was no indication of sleep apnea problems due to his reported sleep issues. While a May 2016 VA examination for mental disorder reflects that the Veteran reported he had talked to his providers about his sleep apnea symptoms, he had not had a sleep study yet. At that time, the VA examiner noted it was difficult to determine what level of sleep impairment was secondary to his psychiatric diagnosis versus possible untreated sleep apnea without resorting to mere speculation. Also at that time, there was no follow up to determine sleep apnea, and no sleep study had been done until October 2020 to confirm a diagnosis of sleep apnea. 

The Board observes that there is no evidence of a nexus between the currently diagnosed sleep apnea and the Veteran's active service. The evidence of record does not demonstrate any medical opinions relating the current disability to the Veteran's active service, and the medical evidence of record does not demonstrate a continuity of treatment or symptoms. Although insomnia was noted in service and in post-service treatment records, this disability has distinctly different characteristics from sleep apnea, which was initially complained of in an October 2015 VA outpatient treatment report and confirmed by a sleep study in an October 2020 private treatment report.

While a Veteran is competent to report treatment and symptoms of a disorder, s/he is not competent to diagnose or medically attribute any in-service symptom or incident to a current disorder. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any sleep apnea symptoms began during his active service or have continued since that time. The issues are medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. Therefore, it is outside the competence of the Veteran to relate the current sleep apnea disability to active service in this case, as such would constitute a medical conclusion, which the Veteran is not competent to make as a lay person. See id. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran was not afforded an examination in connection with the claim for service connection for sleep apnea. VA's duty to assist requires provision of an examination when there is a current disability, an injury in service, and a possible nexus between them. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). However, the probative evidence does not establish a threshold requirement of service connection. Thus, the Board finds a VA examination was not required in connection with this claim, as there was no competent evidence during the period of review, lay or medical, of any symptoms or complaints during service. As such, a VA examination is not warranted for this claim.

As the evidence persuasively favors against the claim for service connection for sleep apnea it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection for sleep apnea is denied. 

9. Service Connection for Headaches

In considering that the June 2009 AOJ decision granted entitlement to service connection for a post-concussion headache and assigned a disability rating from August 1, 2008, which is still currently in effect, there is no unresolved question of law or fact in this matter before the Board. The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5). In light of the fact that the issue for service connection for headaches has already been granted from August 1, 2008, the date after his separation from active service, and is currently in effect, there remains no claim over which the Board may exercise jurisdiction. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (a), 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.101; see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997). As such, this issue is dismissed as moot.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher evaluation; otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). 

A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). The analysis in the following decision is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different "staged" ratings may be warranted for different time periods. Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned after the granting of service connection, separate ratings may also be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, i.e., "staged" ratings. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). 

In rating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider, along with the schedular criteria, functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995). The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated innervation, or other pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.40. Pain on movement, swelling, deformity, or atrophy of disuse as well as instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, standing, and weight bearing are relevant considerations for determination of joint disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45. Painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimal compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 applies to disabilities other than arthritis). Although pain may cause functional loss, pain, itself, does not constitute functional loss and is just one factor to be considered when evaluating functional impairment. Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011). 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 does not require a separate rating for pain but rather provides guidance for determining ratings under other diagnostic codes assessing musculoskeletal function. See Spurgeon v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 194 (1997).

In order to be adequate, VA examinations must include joint testing for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016). VA examiners must provide opinions regarding flare-ups based upon estimates derived from information procured from relevant sources, including lay statements, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (21q017). 

In this case, the VA examinations of the cervical and thoracolumbar spine during the applicable period of review documented whether there was pain on movement in active and passive ranges of motion as well as pain in weight-bearing and in non-weightbearing positions in both the affected joint and non-affected opposite joint. The VA examiners also provided opinions regarding flare ups, repetitive motion and repeated use over time. As the VA examinations addressed flare ups, weight bearing, non-weight-bearing, and active and passive motion in accordance with the Correia and Sharp cases, a remand would be unnecessary.

The Board observes that changes were made to several musculoskeletal rating codes in 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, effective February 7, 2021. However, as the claims were initiated following the regulation changes and there were no substantive changes to DCs 5237, 5243 or the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, the claims for increased ratings will be considered under the rating criteria in effect from February 7, 2021, and the Board is able to proceed with a decision on these issues. 

The Veteran's cervical and lumbar spine disabilities are rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5237 (lumbar) and 5243 (cervical), which are evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine. 

DC 5003 provides that degenerative arthritis that is established by X-ray findings will be rated on the basis of limitation of motion under the appropriate diagnostic codes for the specific joint or joints involved unless there is noncompensable limitation of motion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Disabilities of the spine are rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine (in other words under DCs 5235 to 5242, unless evaluated instead under DC 5243, the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, with or without symptoms such as pain (whether or not it radiates), stiffness, or aching in the area of the spine affected by residuals of injury or disease:  

A 10 percent evaluation is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. 

A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine; or forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.

A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

The Notes following the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine provide further guidance in rating diseases or injuries of the spine. Note (1) provides that any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, should be rated separately under an appropriate DC. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5235-5243. 

Note (2) provides that, for VA compensation purposes, normal forward flexion of the cervical spine is zero to 45 degrees, extension is zero to 45 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 45 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 80 degrees. Normal forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine is zero to 90 degrees, extension is zero to 30 degrees, left and right lateral flexion are zero to 30 degrees, and left and right lateral rotation are zero to 30 degrees. The combined range of motion refers to the sum of the range of forward flexion, extension, left and right lateral flexion, and left and right rotation. The normal combined range of motion of the cervical spine is 340 degrees and of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. The normal ranges of motion for each component of spinal motion provided in this note are the maximum that can be used for calculation of the combined range of motion. See also 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.

Note (3) provides that, in exceptional cases, an examiner may state that because of age, body habitus, neurologic disease, or other factors not the result of disease or injury of the spine, the range of motion of the spine in a particular individual should be considered normal for that individual, even though it does not conform to the normal range of motion stated in Note (2). Provided that the examiner supplies an explanation, the examiner's assessment that the range of motion is normal for that individual will be accepted. 

Note (4) provides that the rater is to round each range of motion measurement to the nearest five degrees. 

Note (5) provides that, for VA compensation purposes, unfavorable ankylosis is a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the  following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of  vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal  margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching. Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis.

Note (6) provides that disability of the thoracolumbar and cervical spine segments are to be rated separately, except when there is unfavorable ankylosis of both segments, which will be rated as a single disability.

Under DC 5243, intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) or disc disease may be rated under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, which includes combining separate evaluations of the chronic orthopedic and neurologic manifestations, or under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, which are rated on the total duration of incapacitating episodes over the past 12 months, whichever results in the higher evaluation when all disabilities are combined under 38 C.F.R. § 4.25. Under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, if there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least one week but less than two weeks during the past 12 months, a 10 percent rating is warranted. If there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months, a 20 percent rating is warranted. If there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months, a 40 percent rating is warranted. If there are incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least six weeks during the past 12 months, a 60 percent rating is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

Note (1) in DC 5243 defines an incapacitating episode as a period of acute signs and symptoms requiring bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician. Supplementary information in the published final regulations states that treatment by a physician would not require a visit to a physician's office or hospital but would include telephone consultation with a physician. If there are no records of the need for bed rest and treatment, by regulation, there are no incapacitating episodes. Id.

1. A Disability Rating in Excess of 10 percent for Lumbosacral Strain

Throughout the duration of the appeal, the probative evidence of record, including private and VA medical records and the July 2023 VA examination, demonstrates that the Veteran's lumbosacral strain, at worst, has been productive of flexion to 90 degrees, extension to 30 degrees, objective evidence of pain but no additional limitation, no additional limitation with observed repetitive use, repetitive use over time or flare ups, no localized tenderness or guarding resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; no findings of flexion limited between 30 to 60 degrees or 30 degrees or less, favorable or unfavorable ankylosis of the thoracolumbar spine or the entire spine, or incapacitating episodes in a 12 month period. In the July 2023 VA examination, the Veteran specifically denied having flare ups. Therefore, the lumbosacral strain more nearly approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent disability rating under DC 5237. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

While neurological manifestations of the thoracolumbar spine have been indicated by the July 2023 VA examination, separate ratings for these manifestations have been awarded and were not specifically noted in the VA Form 10182, and thus, are not on appeal before the Board.

While pain was noted throughout the duration of the appeal, there have been no findings of pain causing limitation of motion or function, and no additional limitation akin to flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees, or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees. In fact, the July 2023 VA examiner considered the Veteran's reported symptoms, which included pain but denied flare-ups. Thus, in considering the complaints and findings of pain in the lumbar spine with active and passive range of motion in conjunction with 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, consistent with the decision in DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995), the Board finds the evidence supports no more than the 10 percent disability rating currently assigned for the Veteran's back condition. See Voyles v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 451, 454 (1993); Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011). 

Accordingly, the Veteran's lumbosacral strain does not warrant a disability rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5237 throughout the duration of the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).

2. A Disability Rating in Excess of 10 Percent for Cervical Spondyloarthropathy

Throughout the duration of the appeal, the probative evidence of record, including private and VA medical records and the June 2023 VA examination, demonstrates that the Veteran's cervical spondyloarthropathy, at worst, has been productive of pain and limitation of flexion to 40 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, pain with range of motion, pain limiting motion to 35 degrees of flexion with repetitive use over time, and no reports of flare ups. There have been no findings of incapacitating episodes or ankylosis, favorable or unfavorable, of the cervical spine, thoracolumbar spine or entire spine. In the June 2023 VA examination, the Veteran specifically denied having flare ups. Therefore, the cervical spondyloarthropathy more nearly approximates the criteria for the currently assigned 10 percent disability rating under DC 5243. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. 

While pain was noted throughout the duration of the appeal, there have been no findings of pain causing limitation of motion or function, and the June 2023 VA examination demonstrated pain with repetitive use limiting flexion to 35 degrees and no additional limitation akin to flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees, or the combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees. In addition, the June 2023 VA examiner considered the Veteran's reported symptoms, which included pain but denied flare-ups. Thus, in considering the complaints and findings of pain in the cervical spine with active and passive range of motion in conjunction with 38 C.F.R. § 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, consistent with the decision in DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995), the Board finds the evidence supports no more than the 10 percent disability rating currently assigned for the Veteran's cervical spine disability. See Voyles v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 451, 454 (1993); Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011). 

The Board has considered whether separate ratings are warranted based on neurological manifestations of the Veteran's cervical spine disability; however, no such manifestations have been demonstrated by the objective or subjective findings of record.

Accordingly, the Veteran's cervical spondyloarthropathy does not warrant a disability rating in excess of 10 percent under DC 5243 throughout the duration of the appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a; Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518, 519 (1996).

Effective Dates

Generally, and except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim for disability compensation, i.e., service connection, is received within one year after separation from service, the effective date of entitlement is the day following separation or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

The effective date for an increase will typically be the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). However, for an increase in disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). For earlier effective date increased rating claims, if the increase occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (Sept. 23, 1998). 

Under former regulations pertaining to legacy appeals, prior to February 19, 2019, a rating decision becomes final and binding if the Veteran does not timely perfect an appeal of the decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of the rating decision. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(a), 3.156(b), 3.160(d), 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.1103. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), a claimant may continuously pursue a claim after notice of a decision on an initial claim or supplemental claim by timely and properly filing a supplemental claim, requesting higher-level review, or appealing to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on higher-level review, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. After notice of a decision on an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the claimant may file a supplemental claim or file a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. After a decision on an appeal to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, the claimant may file a supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

The Court has emphasized that an effective date cannot be challenged with a freestanding earlier effective date claim. Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006). Rather, once a rating decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only basis for challenging the effective date is a motion to revise the decision on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the decision assigning the effective date, the reversal of which would result in an earlier effective date. 38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.160; Rudd, 20 Vet. App. 296 at 299.

1. An Effective Date Prior to June 8, 2023, for the Award of Service Connection for Erectile Dysfunction

The outcome of this claim rests on whether there was an earlier date of entitlement and an earlier date of claim which did not have a final and binding disposition. In this case, the Veteran's current appeal stems from his intent to file form, received on June 8, 2023, and the filing of a fully developed claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction on June 30, 2023. Although his attorney argued in the April 2024 VA Form 10182 that service connection for erectile dysfunction should be awarded back to May 11, 2023, which he states is the date of the intent to file form, the record does not reflect that an intent to file form was received on May 11, 2023. In this case, an intent to file form was received in December 2021, over one year prior to this claim, and a subsequent intent to file form was not received until June 2023. The Board acknowledges that there was a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, dated May 11, 2023. However, erectile dysfunction was not claimed on this form.

The Board observes that, although VA outpatient treatment records reflect prior treatment for erectile dysfunction as far back as March 2009, there was no pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction prior to June 8, 2023. 

The Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction on June 8, 2023. This claim was denied in an August 2023 rating decision. The Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher Level Review on November 14, 2023. On December 19, 2023, the RO found that the issue of erectile dysfunction was returned for correction of a duty to assist error in the prior decision, nothing that the RO had failed to get an examination and/or medical opinion and the claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction will be developed for a VA examination with medical opinion. Thereafter, the claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction was granted by a January 2024 rating decision and awarded a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation, effective June 8, 2023. This decision was appealed to the Board via an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

The probative medical evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran was initially treated and diagnosed with erectile dysfunction in a March 2009 VA outpatient treatment report. 

The applicable regulation is clear that the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection in this case is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Although there was treatment for erectile dysfunction prior to June 8, 2023, there were no prior pending or unadjudicated claims for erectile dysfunction and the earliest date of claim is June 8, 2023. Accordingly, while there was an earlier date of entitlement dating back to March 2009, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 can be no earlier than June 8, 2023, the effective date assigned by the RO, as this is the later of the two dates. Thus, an effective date prior to June 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction is not warranted. 

2. An Effective Date Prior to May 11, 2023, for the Award of Service Connection for Lumbosacral Strain

The outcome of this claim rests on whether there was an earlier date of entitlement and an earlier date of claim which did not have a final and binding disposition. In this case, the Veteran's current appeal stems from his claims form on May 11, 2023. The Board observes that, although VA outpatient treatment records reflect prior treatment for low back pain as far back as October 2015, there was no pending, unadjudicated claim for service connection for lumbosacral strain, or other low back disability, prior to May 11, 2023. 

The Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for back pain on May 11, 2023. This claim was granted in an August 2023 rating decision and assigned an effective date of May 11, 2023. The Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Request for a Higher Level Review on November 14, 2023. On December 19, 2023, the RO found that an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain was not warranted. This decision was appealed to the Board via an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

The probative medical evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran was initially treated and diagnosed with low back pain in an October 2015 VA outpatient treatment report. Prior to this date, the Board observes that "back pain" was noted as far back as a March 2009 VA outpatient treatment records; however, this was specified as upper back pain. 

The applicable regulation is clear that the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection in this case is the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Although there was treatment for lumbosacral strain prior to May 11, 2023, there were no prior pending or unadjudicated claims for lumbar spine disability and the earliest date of claim is May 11, 2023. Accordingly, while there was an earlier date of entitlement dating back to October 2015, the proper effective date for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 can be no earlier than May 11, 2023, the effective date assigned by the RO, as this is the later of the two dates. Thus, an effective date prior to May 11, 2023, for the award of service connection for lumbosacral strain is not warranted. 

3. An Effective Date Prior to May 11, 2023, for the Assignment of a 10 Percent Disability Rating for Cervical Spondyloarthropathy

The Board initially observes that the Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent disability rating for his cervical spondyloarthropathy, effective August 1, 2008, the date after the day of his separation from active service. In a November 2023 request for a Higher Level Review, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the rating and effective date for the neck condition and listed the August 2023 rating decision as the rating decision for which he sought higher level review. A December 2023 rating decision adjudicated the effective date for cervical spondyloarthropathy as an effective date for the award of service connection for cervical spondyloarthropathy and denied this claim. 

However, in this case, the Board notes that the August 2023 rating decision for which the Veteran disagreed with the effective date of the award of a 10 percent rating did not actually assign an effective date for the 10 percent rating. Rather, the RO continued a 10 percent rating for cervical spondyloarthropathy. The RO granted service connection for cervical spondyloarthropathy in a June 2009 rating decision, assigning a 10 percent rating and effective date of August 1, 2008. The rating decision that assigned a 10 percent rating and effective date was not appealed. While new and material evidence was submitted within one year, this was considered in an October 2009 rating decision which was not appealed. Therefore, the rating decision that initially assigned a 10 percent rating and effective date became final.

Once a rating decision that establishes an effective date becomes final, the only way that such a decision can be revised is if it contains CUE. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300 (holding that any other result with vitiate the rule of finality); DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52 (2006) (stating there is no procedure for filing a freestanding challenge to the finality of a VA decision).

In other words, if there is disagreement as to the effective date assigned in a given rating action, it must be timely appealed within one year of notice of the rating decision assigning the effective date. In cases where this is not done, only a finding of CUE in an unappealed, final decision would yield an earlier effective date. In this case, the Veteran has not alleged any instances of CUE and is therefore not seeking an earlier effective date on the basis of CUE.

To the extent that the Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date for the award of a 10 percent rating for a cervical spine disability on any basis other than CUE, such a claim is precluded. As freestanding earlier effective claims are barred as a matter of law, the claim for an earlier effective date must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296.

4. An Effective Date of May 11, 2022, Though no Earlier, for the Assignment of a 100 Percent Disability Rating for Bipolar I Disorder with Anxious Distress with Rapid Cycling with Mood-Congruent Psychotic Features, Most Recent Episode Depressed, and TBI

The outcome of this claim rests on whether there was an earlier date of entitlement and an earlier date of claim that was continuously pursued. 

The Veteran, through his attorney, contends that the 100 percent disability rating for his bipolar I disorder should be awarded back to May 11, 2022, within one year prior to the date of the current claim on appeal. 

In this case, the Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability, originally claimed as major depression, in September 2008, which was granted by the RO in August 2009. The Veteran did not appeal the 70 percent rating assigned at that time, and therefore the August 2009 rating decision was final. In a January 2015 rating decision, the RO proposed to reduce service-connected major depression from 70 percent disabling to 0 percent disabling. After adequate notice, the RO reduced the rating for major depression from 70 percent to 0 percent in an April 2015 rating decision, effective May 1, 2015, which was not appealed and therefore it was final. The Veteran filed an intent to file a claim on October 22, 2015. In December 2015, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating for his psychiatric disability. In a July 2016 rating decision, the RO assigned a 70 percent disability rating for major depression, effective October 22, 2015. The Veteran did not appeal this decision and therefore it was final. The Veteran filed an intent to file a claim form in December 2021; however, he did not file any claims within a year of this form. Thereafter, he filed a claim for an increased rating for his psychiatric disability on May 11, 2023, and, in an August 2023 rating decision, the RO increased the psychiatric disability to 100 percent, effective May 11, 2023, and the Veteran has continuously pursued the appeal of the effective date assigned to this disability in the current appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

Therefore, for purposes of this analysis, if it is factually ascertainable that the evidence shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disability warrants a 100 percent rating prior to submission of the May 11, 2023, claim, then the Veteran would be entitled to an increased disability evaluation if such increase occurred within the one-year period prior to May 11, 2023. In this case, the Board finds that there was evidence of an earlier date of entitlement back to May 11, 2022, to assign a 100 percent disability rating for bipolar I disorder.

The severity of the Veteran's bipolar I disorder is ascertained under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9432. 

Prior to May 11, 2023, the evidence of record demonstrates that a 100 percent disability rating for the Veteran's psychiatric disability is warranted. In this case, in the approximate one-year period prior to May 11, 2023, VA outpatient psychiatric treatment reports from March 2022 and July 2022 demonstrate that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms included: increased depression; increased anxiety; hallucinations; fair judgment and insight; suicidal ideation; ending of a five year relationship; impaired concentration; sleep impairment; a manic mood; decreased interest and pleasure in activities; and no energy or motivation. An April 2023 VA outpatient treatment report reflects that the Veteran had reported having auditory hallucinations, including a voice saying for him to kill himself, and he was hearing very negative commentaries by voices chronically.

The Board finds that, the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability has occurred was May 11, 2022, within one year of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating, in considering the increased symptoms noted above in the VA outpatient treatment reports within a year of the date of the claim. Accordingly, an earlier effective date of May 11, 2022, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for bipolar I disorder.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively supports the claim for an effective date of May 11, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of a 100 percent disability rating for bipolar I disorder with anxious distress with rapid cycling with mood-congruent psychotic features, most recent episode depressed, and TBI. see 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

5. An Effective Date of May 11, 2022, Though no Earlier, for the Award of SMC Based on Housebound Status

The Veteran contends that an award of SMC based on housebound status is warranted prior to May 11, 2023. 

The Board finds that an effective date of May 11, 2022, for an award of SMC based on housebound status is warranted.

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to assess all of a claimant's service-connected disabilities to determine whether any combination of the disabilities establishes eligibility for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250-51 (2010); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008). In Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280, the Court held that 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total" rating. When a veteran is awarded TDIU based on a single disability and receives schedular disability ratings for other conditions, SMC based on the statutory housebound criteria may be awarded so long as the same disability is not counted twice, i.e., as a basis for TDIU and as a separate disability rated 60 percent or more disabling. See 75 Fed. Reg. 11,229, 11,230, Summary of Precedent Opinions of the VA General Counsel (March 10, 2010) (withdrawing VAOPGCPREC 6-1999 in light of Bradley, 22 Vet. App. at 280).  

Special monthly compensation is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and (1) has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems, or, (2) is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i). 

A veteran with a 100 percent schedular disability rating for a single service-connected disability could also obtain a TDIU on a single separate disability (though not on multiple service-connected disabilities), in order to meet the SMC requirements (100 percent rating plus 60 percent rating). A TDIU could meet the SMC requirements by either: a) increasing a single disability rating of less than 60 percent to at least 60 percent (in a case where a separate 100 percent rating is already established), or b) increasing a single disability that is less than 100 percent to a "total" (100 percent) rating, in a case where there is already established a combination of other ratings that meet the separate 60 percent rating requirement for SMC. See Buie at 249-50.

The Veteran contends that SMC should be granted back to May 11, 2022, in conjunction with an earlier effective date for the assignment of a 100 percent disability rating for his psychiatric disability. The Veteran's SMC claim was based on the 100 percent disability rating awarded for his psychiatric disability and having additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent from May 11, 2023. As noted below, the Board has determined an earlier effective date of May 11, 2022, was established for the 100 percent rating for his service-connected bipolar I disorder, and the Veteran had additional service-connected disabilities that were independently ratable at 60 percent from October 22, 2015. Therefore, an earlier effective date for SMC based on housebound status has been established from May 11, 2022. 

Therefore, an earlier date of entitlement to SMC based on housebound status has been established by the record. Accordingly, an effective date of May 11, 2022, though no earlier, for the award of SMC based on housebound status is granted.
