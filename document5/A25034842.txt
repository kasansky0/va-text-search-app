ORDER

FINDING OF FACT

The proposed reduction was not an adverse action; therefore, it was not appealable. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met for dismissal of the appeal pertaining to a proposed reduction of the evaluation of thoracic and lumbosacral strain, degenerative disc disease, IVDS, and retrolisthesis. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1994 to March 1999. See Form DD 214.

VA regulations provide that a Notice of Disagreement must identify specific decisions and issue or issues therein with which a claimant disagrees. The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in §3.151(c). 38 C.F.R. §20.202(a).

In a July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ proposed the reduction in the Veteran's back disability rating based on objective improvement shown in a June 2021 back examination. Under 38 C.F.R. §3.105, a rating proposing a reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. 38 C.F.R. §3.105(e). The beneficiary must be notified at the last address of record of the action contemplated and furnished detailed reasons for the proposed decision. Id. Sixty days must be given for the presentation of new evidence to show that compensation should be continued at the present level. 

Subsequently, in July 2021, the Veteran was sent a proposal to reduce the evaluation of her back disability. In accordance with 38 C.F.R. §3.105, the proposal to reduce period was sixty days (60) from the date of notification, and the Veteran was able to submit evidence opposing a reduction during this timeframe. The earliest date of reduction would be the first day of the month following the 60-day period after final notification.  

In September 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) appealing the proposed reduction of the evaluation of her back disability (thoracic and lumbosacral strain, degenerative disc disease, IVDS and retrolisthesis) from 20 percent to 10 percent. This Notice of Disagreement was in response to the reduction proposal. 

In September 2021, VA sent the Veteran a letter notifying the Veteran that the attempted Notice of Disagreement was premature, as only a proposal to reduce benefits had been made and the action had not been carried out as of that date. The Veteran was notified that if the reduction was enacted, she would receive written notification and given appropriate appellate rights. 

As such, a proposed reduction of the evaluation of thoracic and lumbosacral strain, degenerative disc disease, IVDS, and retrolisthesis from 20 percent to 10 percent was not an adverse action and is, therefore, not appealable. 

Currently, as the record stands, there are no pending valid issues before the Board. As there is no question of fact or law, the appeal is dismissed.
