ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of January 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim on January 19, 2022, via facsimile and the Veteran's complete application for disability compensation on February 24, 2022.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400; M21-1, Part II.iii.2.A.2.g. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2000 to June 2004.    

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date of January 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran's representative contends entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted no later than January 19, 2022, the date from which the VA received the Veteran's intent to file (ITF).  See March 24, 2023 Third Party Correspondence.  

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the day following separation from active-duty service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within 1 year after separation from service; otherwise, date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)-(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

A claim is a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the VA submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p).  

A claimant or his or her representative may indicate a desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. An intent to file a claim can be submitted (i) electronically, (ii) in writing on the paper intent to file form proscribed by VA and signed and dated, or (iii) orally communication to VA personnel. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each intent to file, and if multiple claims are filed within one year of an intent to file, only the first claim filed will be associated with the intent to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(ii).

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). Relevant to this appeal are M21-1 provisions which include detailed processes for handling the receipt of ITFs.  

When VA receives an ITF form on the same date it receives an application for the same benefit, the ITF form is associated with the complete application form and the ITF form will no longer function with respect to subsequent filings. The ITF form is "consumed" as it may only apply to one complete application submitted within a year of the filing of the ITF form itself. M21-1, Part II.iii.2.A.2.f.  

When VA receives an ITF on the same date it receives an application for the same benefit through means other than a VA claims submission service website, the ITF will remain active pending receipt of a subsequent claim. M21-1, Part II.iii.2.A.2.g.  

Here, VA received the Veteran's ITF and a supplemental application for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on January 19, 2022.  The Veteran submitted both forms via facsimile.  VA received a complete application for service connection for tinnitus on February 24, 2022.  In a May 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for tinnitus, assigning an effective date of February 24, 2022, based on the date of receipt of the initial complete application.  

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim for an earlier effective date on October 7, 2022, which the AOJ denied in a November 7, 2022, rating decision.  On March 24, 2023, the Veteran filed a higher-level review (HLR) request.  On July 6, 2023, VA issued a letter stating that the HLR request was premature.  On July 13, 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision denying the earlier effective date claim.  

As noted above, the VA received the Veteran's ITF and supplemental application for TDIU and PTSD via facsimile, not the VA claims submission service website.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1131 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Intent to file a claim form applies to supplemental claims).  As such, the ITF received on January 19, 2022, remained active pending receipt of a subsequent claim.  M21-1, Part II.iii.2.A.2.g.  The subsequent complete application for service connection for tinnitus was received on February 24, 2022, within one year of the ITF.  There was no other intervening claim since the filing of the January 19, 2022, ITF that would have consumed that ITF.  Thus, application of the M21-1 provisions warrants an effective date based on the date of receipt of the ITF, or January 19, 2022, which is more than one year after the Veteran's separation from active service.  

An even earlier effective date for the award of service connection is not supported by the evidence of record. The Veteran does not assert, and the evidence does not show, he filed an earlier complete application for service connection for tinnitus or earlier ITF that can be associated with the February 24, 2022, complete application.  

For the above reasons, the probative evidence of the record persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of January 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine therefore does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017).  Therefore, entitlement to an effective date of January 19, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is warranted, and the claim is granted.
