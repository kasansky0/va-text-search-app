ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder associated with military sexual trauma is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

PTSD and major depressive disorder associated with military sexual trauma has been shown to have originated during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW 

The criteria for service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder associated with to military sexual trauma are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION 

The Veteran had active service from October 1984 to September 1986 and from September 1990 to March 1991.  The Veteran had additional duty with the Navy Reserve. 

In September 2020, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for major depressive disorder.  In August 2021, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Evidence Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with or within 90 days from receipt of VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.  

Service Connection for a Psychiatric Disability 

The Veteran asserts that service connection for a psychiatric disability is warranted as the diagnosed major depressive disorder and PTSD were incurred as the result of military sexual trauma.

Service connection may be granted for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Establishing service connection for PTSD requires (1) a current diagnosis of PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a causal nexus between current symptomatology and the specific claimed in-service stressor.  If a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.  Examples of such evidence include but are not limited to the following: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy.  Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources.  Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will not deny a PTSD claim that is based on in-service personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran 's service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise VA of potential sources of such evidence.  VA may submit any evidence that it receives to an appropriate medical or mental health professional for an opinion as to whether it indicates that a personal assault occurred.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

VA clinical documentation dated in June 2014 VA states that the Veteran was diagnosed with "PTSD from military sexual trauma" and major depressive disorder.   

In her July 2020 Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connection for PTSD, VA Form 21-0781, the Veteran reported that she had been raped by a fellow serviceman while on a date in November 1985 during active service and was thereafter assaulted by a petty officer at the Rota, Spain, Naval Base in October 1990.  She stated that although she had reported the October 1990 assault to her command, no formal action was taken to address the assault. 

A July 2021 VA psychological evaluation states that the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD and unspecified major depressive disorder.  The VA psychologist noted that the reported in service November 1985 rape and October 1990 assault "contributed to [the Veteran's] traumatic responses/symptoms in [the past and at the present time."  She opined that "it is my clinical opinion, that [the Veteran's] symptoms of PTSD and depressive episodes have caused significant distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning while in service, after discharge, and at the present time" and "these symptoms are found to be more likely than not a direct result of the trauma experience in the military." 

The evidence is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed PTSD and major depressive disorder originated during active service.  The Veteran states that she was the victim of both an in service November 1985 rape and a subsequent in service October 1990 assault.  Treating VA psychiatric personnel have diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and major depressive disorder due to military sexual trauma.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD and major depressive disorder due to military sexual trauma is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
