ORDER

The appeal of the proposed action to sever service connection for diabetes mellitus type II is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The issue of severance of service connection for diabetes mellitus type II ("diabetes") was a proposed action in the August 30, 2024, rating decision, and was not a final decision on the merits.

2. The Veteran's attempt to appeal the proposed severance action was premature and was docketed in error; and there is no issue of law or fact presently before the Board on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD), received by the Board on September 20, 2024, was not valid to initiate an appeal of the August 30, 2024, rating decision proposing to sever service connection for diabetes; thus, the criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding the propriety of the proposed severance have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104, 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 1968 to March 1971.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 30, 2024, proposed rating decision (with notification letter September 4, 2024) of a Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office. In the September 20, 2024, VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

Ultimately, as will be discussed below, the Board concludes that because the appeal is premature, and there is no issue of law or fact for the Board to adjudicate, the appeal is dismissed.

1. Dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of the appeal regarding the propriety of the proposed action to sever service connection for diabetes mellitus type II

The Board does not have jurisdiction over this appeal, and it is dismissed. 

The Board has jurisdiction where there is a question of law or fact on appeal to the Secretary. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104. Consequently, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

An appeal to the Board consists of an NOD timely filed in response to a decision on the merits, issued by a VA Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. 

For reductions in rating or severance of service connection, the RO is required to issue a rating decision proposing the action and setting forth all material facts and reasons, notify the beneficiary of the contemplated action and furnish detailed reasons therefore, and allow 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that payments should continue at the present level. Thereafter, if a reduction or severance is found to be warranted, a final rating decision on the merits will be issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).

Here, the RO issued an August 30, 2024, rating decision which, in pertinent part, proposed to sever service connection for diabetes. The Veteran then filed a VA Form 10182 NOD on September 20, 2024, indicating his disagreement with the proposal to sever service connection for diabetes.

A proposed rating decision is not a decision on the merits. In that regard, no actual severance of service connection for diabetes had occurred at the time of the August 30, 2024, rating decision, nor by the time the Veteran filed his September 2024 VA Form 10182. No appeal could be initiated from the proposal to sever service connection, as it was only a proposal and not a final decision on the matter. Thus, with the submission of the September 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran prematurely sought to appeal the proposal to sever service connection for diabetes.

The Board improperly docketed this issue on appeal. Procedurally, the proposal to sever service connection was not a decision on the merits; there was no matter in controversy and no allegation of error of fact or law eligible for appellate consideration at that time. In other words, at the time the Veteran filed his appeal, there was not yet any question of law or fact to be appealed with respect to service connection for diabetes. The Board also notes the Veteran requested a Board hearing, but the Board cannot hold a hearing where there is no issue properly on appeal.

The Board observes that the file contains a March 2025 VA Form 21-4138 in which the Veteran's representative indicated the appeal had been "filed in error" and requested a predetermination hearing rather than a BVA hearing. However, the Board does not find that this written submission is adequate to withdraw the appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Therefore, the Board must proceed with the dismissal based on a lack of jurisdiction. 

Consequently, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal and, as such, it must be dismissed as a matter of law. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104, 20.202; see Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
