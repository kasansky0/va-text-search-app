REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA/stroke) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1967 to October 1987.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In March 2025, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement and selected Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  38 C.F.R. ยง 19.2(d).

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for a stroke is remanded.

The Board finds that a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made, which requires a remand to the RO for correction.

The January 2024 VA examination is inadequate to decide the claim due to its inconsistency.  The examiner noted that the history of the Veteran's CVA included left-sided weakness as a residual, but then attributed all the Veteran's weakness to his nonservice-connected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).  Furthermore, in one section he attributed the Veteran's memory problems to his nonservice-connected disability but then elsewhere attributed it to his CVA.  Finally, he stated the CVA diagnosis changed to NPH and that this was a new and separate diagnosis not related to the CVA without explaining how a service-connected diagnosis can change to an unrelated nonservice-connected diagnosis.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Arrange for the Veteran to have a VA examination for residuals of his CVA.  The clinician must clearly identify the symptoms and manifestations associated with the Veteran's CVA.  If the Veteran is unable to report for the examination, then the clinician should review the record and identify the residual symptoms based on the record review.
