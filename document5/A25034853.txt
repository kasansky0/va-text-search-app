ORDER

A March 1969 rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error (CUE), and an effective date of January 7, 1969 for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on the loss of a creative organ is granted.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The correct facts, as they were known as the time, were not before the adjudicator of the March 1969 rating decision, and the failure to correctly apply the laws and regulations manifestly changed the outcome of that rating decision. 

2. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not render him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation consistent with his education and work history. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for revision of the March 1969 rating decision on the basis of CUE have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5109A, 7105(c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.

2. The criteria for a TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1964 to November 1969.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in February 2025 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

At the outset, the Board notes that it may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act (AMA) docket switch has elapsed. A claimant may switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from when the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date VA mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) he or she has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303, or (2) they have requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe. 

In this case, less than one year has elapsed since the Veteran was notified of the February 2025 rating decision on appeal and less than 60 days have elapsed from the date the Board received his VA Form 10182. However, the Board finds that any additional delay simply to wait for such deadlines to pass would only unnecessarily delay the appeal, without any discernable benefit to the Veteran. This claim has been advanced on the docket by the request of the Veteran, which the Board interprets as a desire to have his appeal resolved as quickly as possible. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); cf. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  Accordingly, the Board finds that it is in the Veteran's interest that this matter be adjudicated without further delay, and it has therefore done so herein.  

CUE - SMC

The Veteran seeks revision of a May 2008 rating decision that granted SMC, based on the loss of a creative organ, from December 17, 2007. That decision noted that the Veteran had a testicle removed in service and, thus, his service-connected inguinal hernia encompassed the lost testicle, warranting SMC. The December 2007 date was selected because it was the date that he filed a claim for an increased disability rating. 

The Veteran asserts that because his service treatment records, which clearly showed an in-service orchiectomy, were associated with the record in 2016, revision of the May 2008 rating decision is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). He asks that CUE be found in the May 2008 rating decision, and an earlier effective date of January 7, 1969, be granted for SMC. The Board agrees that there has been CUE in this appeal; however, for the reasons set forth below, it finds that the CUE lies in the initial March 1969 rating decision, rather than that issued in May 2008. Regardless of which rating decision is revised, it finds that an effective date of January 7, 1969, is warranted. 

A previous determination by an agency of original jurisdiction that is final and binding will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE. Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a). Here, the Veteran did not seek review of the March 1969 rating decision within the allowed time period for an appeal, and it became final. 

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105. CUE is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error of fact or law that, when called to the attention of later reviewers, compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudication improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE. Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of error. Fugo v. Brown, 6. Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993). In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different. Id. At 44.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated[;]" and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time the decision was rendered. Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App. 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision. See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F. 3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999). A manifest change in outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014). The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different. Id. at 442.

As a threshold matter, the Board finds the argument advanced by the Veteran alleges CUE with the requisite specificity. See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003). The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of his claim.

By way of history, in December 1965 and while serving in the United States Navy, the Veteran underwent an orchiectomy to remove an undescended right testicle. The day following his separation from service, January 7, 1969, he filed a claim for service connection for, inter alia, an inguinal hernia. The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 1969, and service connection was granted for residuals of a right inguinal hernia in a March 1969 rating decision. At the time of the rating decision, the Veteran's service treatment records had not been associated with the record. 

Subsequently, in December 2007, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased disability rating for his service-connected right inguinal hernia. In February 2008, he underwent a VA examination in relation to the claim. At that time, the absent right testicle was noted. It was noted at that time that the testicle was surgically removed in service. In the May 2008 rating decision, the Veteran's disability was renamed to encompass the orchiectomy, and a 10 percent disability rating was assigned. The Veteran was also assigned SMC under 38 U.S.C. 1114(k), on account of anatomical loss of a creative organ. Each were assigned an effective date of December 17, 2007. 

Subsequently, in October 2016, the Veteran's service treatment records were associated with his file. As noted above, those records clearly showed that the Veteran underwent an orchiectomy in December 1965. The Veteran's attorney asserts that, because these records are relevant to the claim and were not part of the record at the time of the May 2008 rating decision, that decision was never final under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c), which provides that at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim de novo. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(1). 

However, the Board notes that the associated service treatment records are, in fact, duplicative of the record regarding the orchiectomy and, thus, reconsideration is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c). Notably, the Veteran underwent a general VA examination in February 1974. At that time, it was noted that the Veteran had an undescended right testicle removed in December 1965. 

Rather than revise the May 2008 rating decision, the Board finds on its own accord that revision of the initial March 1969 rating decision is necessary due to CUE. See 38 U.S.C. § 5109A ("[r]eview to determine whether [CUE] exists in a case may be instituted by the Secretary on the Secretary's own motion..."); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. The Board finds CUE in the March 1969 rating decision in failing to apply the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 314(k) (now codified at 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k)) for the anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs. 

The law and regulations at the time of the 1969 rating decision provided for payment of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 314(k) (now 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k)) for each anatomical loss or loss of use of one or more creative organs. When loss or loss of use of a creative organ resulted from wounds or other trauma sustained in service, or resulted from operations in service for the relief of other conditions, the creative organ becoming incidentally involved, the benefit may be granted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(1)(i) and (ii) (1967-1969).

Here, the Veteran was examined in February 1969 in relation to his claim for service connection for a right inguinal hernia and, for reasons lost to time, his physically missing right testicle was not observed. The Board acknowledges that VA's duty to assist by providing an adequate examination cannot constitute CUE. Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1345-47 (Fed. Cir. 2002); see also Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 384 (1994); Fugo, supra. Here, however, the examination failed to note a missing part of the Veteran's external anatomy. While a duty to assist deficiency such as an insufficient examination cannot form a basis for CUE because such deficiency creates only an incomplete, rather than an incorrect, record, here the Board must find that the record was manifestly incorrect, an error which was compounded by the lack of service treatment records at the time of the February 1969 VA examination. See Caffrey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 377, 384 (1994); Livesay v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 165 (2001). 

Thus, the correct facts as they were known as the time, were not before the adjudicator. The Board finds that the Veteran's unobserved missing testicle, combined with a lack of service treatment records documenting an in-service orchiectomy, resulted in the failure to apply the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 314(k). This is an error sufficient to satisfy the first CUE requirement. See Bouton v. Peake, 23 Vet. App. 70, 72 (2008); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Such error, however, cannot constitute CUE unless it is the type of error that would have manifestly changed the outcome of the March 1969 decision. This may be shown where all evidence at the time of the decision "militated in support of the claim." Crippen v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 412, 422 (1996). Here, at the time of the March 1969 rating decision, the Veteran was physically missing a creative organ due to an in-service operation, which warrants SMC. However, this loss was not officially recorded until 1974 and SMC was not implemented until 2008. Therefore, the Board finds that the incomplete file at the time of the initial rating decision, containing a manifestly incorrect error regarding the Veteran's physical anatomy, changed the outcome of that initial decision. Absent this CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset. King, supra. 

In sum, the failure to correctly apply the laws and regulations manifestly changed the outcome of the March 1969 rating decision. As a result, the Board concludes that entitlement to revision of that rating decision on the basis of CUE to reflect the grant of SMC, effective January 7, 1969-that is, the date of the Veteran's initial service connection claim-is warranted. The claim is granted. 

TDIU

The Veteran generally contends, without specificity, that his service-connected disabilities rendered him unable to work. Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that if there is only one such disability, such disability shall be ratable as 60 percent or more, and if there are two or more disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

"Substantially gainful employment" is considered "work that involves doing significant productive physical or mental duties and is done for pay and profit" even if the work "is done on a part-time basis or if a claimant is paid less, or is given less responsibility that when the same claimant worked before." In other words, "substantially gainful occupation" is "one that provides annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that the veteran actually works and without regard to the veteran's earned annual income" prior to when he was last employed. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 356 (2000) (citing analogous Social Security Administration Regulations).

Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances." Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). Therefore, when adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must take into account the individual veteran's education, training, and work history. Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering Veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering Veteran's 8th grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering Veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

Age may not be considered as a factor when evaluating unemployability or intercurrent disability, and it may not be used as a basis for a total disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.19. There must be a determination that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age or a non-service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment. The ultimate question, however, is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

The appeal period before the Board begins on September 19, 2024, the date the Veteran filed his claim for TDIU, and ends on February 27, 2025, the date the rating decision on appeal was issued. During this period, service connection was in effect for left total knee replacement, rated as 60 percent disabling; right inguinal hernia repair with right orchiectomy with scar, 10 percent disabling; residual scar associated with left total knee replacement, 10 percent disabling; and residual scar, left knee, rated as noncompensably disabling. Thus, his combined disability rating for the entire period was 70 percent, and the schedular criteria for TDIU are met. 

In his application for TDIU, the Veteran indicated that he is a college graduate, and worked as a high school dean of students until his service-connected knee prevented him from continuing in that position. (The Board notes, parenthetically, that the Veteran has not alleged, nor does the record show, that his other service-connected disabilities interfered at any time with his employment.) Elsewhere in the record, the Veteran reported to a treating clinician that he held two masters degrees. In January 2011, the Veteran reported to a VA examiner that had retired due to age. In the February 2025 response to a Request for Employment Information, the Veteran's former employer noted without further explanation that the Veteran retired from his role as a "teacher on special assignment" in June 2008, after nearly nine years on the job. 

The Veteran underwent VA examinations related to his service-connected left knee in October 2024 and January 2025. Both VA examiners opined that the Veteran's left knee disability had some functional impact on his ability to work. The October 2024 examiner noted that it was difficult for the Veteran to walk, which required a cane. He was unable to exercise due to the disability. The January 2025 examiner explained that the Veteran's left knee impacted his ability to work only in that he would be unable to walk further than one block, or climb stairs.  

Based on this evidence, the Board must find that TDIU is not warranted. Regarding the functional impairment associated with the Veteran's left knee total replacement, the Board acknowledges that prolonged activities such as standing and walking impact his ability to work. However, considering the Veteran's college education, the scope of his prior work experience, and the functional limitations described by VA examiners, a finding that those limitations were so severe during the claim period as to render him unemployable cannot be supported.

The record shows that the Veteran enjoyed a long career in which he was clearly capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment. Importantly, he holds at least one advanced college degree and has extensive experience working in a school setting. Hatlestad, supra. The variety of important skills obtained through such employment could be transferred to other fields, including those requiring minimal standing, walking or sitting. Thus, the Board cannot find that the criteria for a TDIU, based on the impact of his left knee disability, or the combined effect of all his service-connected disabilities, has been met at any time.

In so finding, the Board acknowledges that there is certainly evidence of a negative effect on the Veteran's employability due to his service-connected disabilities. However, evidence of occupational limitations is present in every case in which an evaluation has been assigned for a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (explaining that disability evaluation percentages "represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civil occupations" and "the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability"); see also Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363 (a "high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment"). The evidence does not support that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities preclude substantially gainful employment in any way.

The criteria for determining whether an individual is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation include a subjective standard, and the ultimate responsibility for determining the effects of disabilities on the question of employability rests with the adjudicator and not a medical examiner. See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In this case, the Veteran's considerable history of substantially gainful employment in a professional field with significant transferrable skills is probative evidence that he was capable of such employment. Accordingly, a TDIU is not warranted. As the evidence persuasively favors against a grant of TDIU, it is not in approximate balance and the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
