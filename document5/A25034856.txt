ORDER

A rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity (LLE) radiculopathy, sciatic nerve is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's LLE sciatic nerve does not more closely approximate moderately severe incomplete paralysis. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 20 percent from for LLE radiculopathy sciatic nerve have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2016 to April 2022. 

The rating decision on appeal was issued on September 7, 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 7, 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Lastly, a claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disability (TDIU) has not been raised by the record. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Here, the Veteran has not asserted TDIU, and the evidence of record has not raised TDIU. See CAPRI (April 2023) (Veteran reports being full-time employed); C&P Exam (August 2023) (the Veteran reports being currently employed). The Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).  When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim.  Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009).  When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed.  Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for LLE radiculopathy, sciatic nerve. 

An April 2022 rating decision granted service connection for LLE radiculopathy, sciatic nerve and assigned a 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8520 effective from April 13, 2022. See Rating Decision (April 2022). A November 2022 rating decision awarded increased rating to 20 percent effective from May 5, 2022. See Rating Decision (November 2022).

On April 21, 2023, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526 requesting an increased rating for LLE radiculopathy. See VA Form 21-526 (April 2023). A September 7, 2023, rating decision denied the claim for increase. See Rating Decision (September 2023). This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with that decision. See VA Form 10182 (August 2024). 

The relevant rating review period begins April 21, 2023, the date of the claim for increase rating, with one year look back; it ends on September 7, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  

The Board concludes that that the criteria for a rating in excess of 20 percent for LL radiculopathy sciatic nerve are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. 

The Veteran's LLE radiculopathy sciatic nerve is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520 (sciatic nerve).

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520. Under these criteria, moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy, is rated as 60 percent disabling. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

The words "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe", "marked", and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. See Spellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 211, 219 (2018). Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are equitable and just. 38 C.F.R. 4.6. The use of the terminology within a VA examination report, moreover, is not in and of itself dispositive. Id. 

With respect to the definition of mild, moderate, and moderately severe, the Veterans Benefits Administration had already issued guidance in the M21-1 Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) defining these terms. The M21-1 is not binding on the Board and, to rely on the M21-1, the Board must conduct an independent analysis before determining whether the provisions may be relied upon as a factor to support its decision. Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018). Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of paralysis of all radicular groups. The M21-1 describes "moderate" incomplete paralysis (that is, a 20 percent rating) should be reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment, where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Id. Also, the M21-1 provides that a "moderately severe" evaluation (that is, a 40 percent rating) is available when there is motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability. Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating. Id. Lastly, for "severe, incomplete paralysis" expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. For the sciatic nerve marked muscular atrophy is expected. And even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve. Further, neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve.

The Board finds that the more persuasive evidence of record weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for LLE radiculopathy. To warrant a higher rating, the evidence must more closely approximate moderately severe incomplete paralysis or worse. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Here, the findings from the VA treatment records and VA examination reports reveal, at most, moderate severity of LLE sciatic nerve. See C&P Exam (November 2022); CAPRI (April 2023); C&P Exam (August 2023). 

Turning to the evidence of record, VA treatment records show complaints of radiating pain down the entire LLE and reported history of previously taking Gabapentin and ibuprofen without relief but no current specific treatment for neurologic impairment. See CAPRI (April 2023). 

A November 2022 VA back examination report includes diagnosis of LLE radiculopathy and the Veteran described symptoms of mild paresthesia and dysesthesias, and moderate numbness. See C&P Exam (November 2022). Also, clinical evaluation revealed normal muscle strength except for reduced muscle strength (4/5) left great toe, normal reflexes, and decreased sensation in lower leg and foot/toes. See C&P Exam (November 2022).

An August 2023 VA peripheral nerve examination report confirmed diagnosis of LLE radiculopathy and the Veteran reported constant sharp shooting pain down entire LLE, numbness and tingling to LLE, difficulty standing and walking for long periods of time, and he denied any no treatment for his neurologic complaints. See C&P Exam (August 2023). The Veteran described symptoms of mild constant pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesia, and severe numbness. See C&P Exam (August 2023). Clinical evaluation revealed normal muscle strength and reflexes, and findings of decreased sensation in the entire LLE, but without muscle atrophy or trophic changes, and he denied requiring use of an assistive device for ambulation. See C&P Exam (August 2023). The report found the Veteran had LLE incomplete paralysis of sciatic nerve characterized as moderate in severity. 

Neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflects more than moderate impairment in the LLE; and symptoms and findings that more closely approximate moderately severe impairment are not shown. In this regard, the VA examination reports show the Veteran complained of mild to severe symptomatology but clinical evaluation of the LLE revealed, at most, no more than slight decrease muscle strength and decreased sensation with normal reflexes and no evidence of muscle atrophy, trophic changes, or complete sensory loss. See C&P Exam (November 2022); C&P Exam (August 2023). Moreover, VA treatment records reflect that the Veteran regularly exercises and is independent in all his activities with daily living (ADLs) without indication that he requires assistance in ambulation because of his LLE radiculopathy. See CAPRI (April 2023). 

Overall, the Board finds that the Veteran's LLE sciatic nerve does not suggest functional impairment equivalent to moderately severe incomplete paralysis or worse as there is no more than reduced muscle strength (4/5), decreased sensation, and subjective complaints of mild to severe symptomatology attributable to his LLE radiculopathy. Although reduced muscle strength tends to demonstrate moderately severe impairment as suggested by the M21-1, the Veteran had only slightly reduced muscle strength measured at 4/5 in his left great toe in November 2022 and normal muscle strength throughout his LLE in August 2023, which does not demonstrate muscle weakness of a higher level as associated with moderately severe or worse impairment any point during the pendency of the appeal. 

To the extent, the Veteran asserts the M21-1 supports "severe symptoms without organic changes are most consistent with at least moderately severe level of impairment," the Board does not find that a holistic review of the evidence shows more than moderate impairment in this case. See Third Party Correspondence (August 2024). As noted above, there is no more than subjective complaints associated with slightly reduced muscle strength and decreased sensation and the Veteran does not require the use of an assistive and there was no finding reduced reflexes, muscle atrophy, trophic changes, or absence of sensation. In sum, the totality of the evidence does not suggest functional impairment equivalent to moderately severe or worse incomplete paralysis in the RLE and LLE, and ratings in excess of 20 for RLE and LLE sciatic nerve radiculopathy are not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

The Board accepts that the Veteran believes his LLE sciatic nerves warrant higher ratings. However, whether a disability meets the schedular criteria for the assignment of a higher evaluation is a factual determination by the Board based on the Veteran's complaints coupled with the medical evidence. Both the lay and medical evidence are probative in this case. Although the Veteran contends that he meets the criteria for the next higher disability rating, his complaints along with the medical findings do not meet the schedular requirements for a higher evaluation than currently assigned, as explained above. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Codes 8520. Further, the Board assigns greater probative value to the medical evidence, to include his VA treatment records and VA examination reports prepared by medical professionals after evaluating the Veteran and review of the record.

The Board is mindful of the need to discount any improvement in disability resulting from ameliorative effects. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012) (holding that a higher rating may not be denied on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating). Here, DC 8520 does not contemplate relief through the use of medication. However, the record does not show the Veteran used medication to treatments his neurologic impairment; and to the extent he previously used medication, he reported no relief of symptoms. Thus, at no point does the record, to include the Veteran's own contentions, suggests he would have symptoms productive of higher evaluations under Code 8520, but for the use of medication. See CAPRI (April 2023); C&P Exam (August 2023). The Board does not find the criteria for a higher rating is warranted even with consideration of the ameliorating effects of medication at any time during the rating review period under appeal.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes. There is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected. Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

On balance, the weight of the evidence is against the claim for increase. 

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
