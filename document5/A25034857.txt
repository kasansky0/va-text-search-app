ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of October 1, 2021, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), is granted. 

REMANDED

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 1, 2021, for the award of a TDIU, is remanded. 

FINDING OF FACT

From October 1, 2021, to the present, the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU and the evidence has shown that the Veteran has been unable to secure and follow substantially gainful employment due to her service-connected psychiatric disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU beginning October 1, 2021, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.15, 4.16, 4.19.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1994 to December 1997. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 21-8940 in March 2022, which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) interpreted as an increased rating claim for her service-connected anxiety disorder and a claim for TDIU.

In March 2023, the AOJ granted a TDIU with an effective date of March 17, 2022, the date of the VA Form 21-8940. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

At the onset, the Board notes that, following the March 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, in February 2025, the AOJ assigned an even earlier effective date of October 8, 2021, for the award of a TDIU. While this action occurred after the March 2023 AOJ decision, the Board finds this is not evidence and that the Board may consider these actions in adjudicating this appeal. 

Entitlement to an effective date of October 1, 2021, for the award of TDIU.

The Veteran, through her representative, contends that an earlier effective date is warranted for the assignment of a TDIU. As explained in more detail below, she contends that she has been unable to maintain substantially gainful employment due, at least in part, to her service-connected psychiatric disability since at least August 1, 2020, and has been continuously pursuing a higher rating for her psychiatric disability since May 22, 2019. 

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. For the purpose of determining one 60 percent disability, disabilities resulting from a common etiology, or a single accident are considered as one disability. 38?C.F.R. §§?3.340, 3.34l, 4.16(a). 

Where these percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to the benefits on an extraschedular basis may be considered when the Veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities. 38?C.F.R. §§?3.321(b), 4.16(b). 

In determining whether an individual is unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, consideration must be given to the type of employment for which the Veteran would be qualified. Such consideration would include education and occupational experience. Age may not be considered a factor. 38?C.F.R. §?3.341. Unemployability associated with advancing age or intercurrent disability may not be used as a basis for assignment of a total disability rating. 38?C.F.R. §?4.19. 

The Veteran is currently service connected for anxiety disorder with panic disorder, evaluated as 70 percent disabling and left foot onychomycosis, evaluated as noncompensable. The Veteran's combined evaluation for compensation purposes is 50 percent beginning May 22, 2019, and 70 percent beginning August October 1, 2021. 38?C.F.R. §?4.25. As such, she met the threshold criteria for a TDIU beginning October 1, 2021. The remaining inquiry is whether she is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation due solely to his service-connected disabilities. 

Turning to the available evidence of record, in a March 2022, VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran reported that she last worked full-time on March 10, 2010, and became too disabled to work on October 7, 2021. Notably, she indicated that she worked as a mental health therapist from November 27, 2017, to July 31, 2020, working, on average 10 to 15 hours per week and making $2000/month. See March 2022 VA 21-8940. She also reported working as a menta; health therapist from August 11, 2020, to October 7, 2021, working, on average 6 hours per week, making $440/month. See March 2022 VA 21-8940. 

Whether a Veteran is able to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation generally involves two components: (1) economic-whether the occupation at issue pays the Veteran more than a marginal income-and (2) noneconomic-whether the Veteran can perform that occupation considering his or her history, education, skill, training, and physical and mental limitations. See Guarino v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 199, 4-5 (February 19, 2025) (citing to Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019)). 

Marginal employment shall generally be deemed to exist when a Veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, (USDCBC), as the poverty threshold for one person. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). 

The USDCBC poverty threshold for one person in the year 2020, was $13,465/yr. 

[https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html].

As for her period of employment ending July 31, 2020, when she worked, on average, 10 to 15 hours per week and made $2000/month, this equates to $24,000/yr. and over the USDBC poverty threshold for one person in 2020. 

As for her period of employment from August 11, 2020, to October 7, 2021, when she worked, on average, 6 hours per week and made $440/month this equates to $5,280/yr. and far under the USDBC poverty threshold for one person in 2020. Thus, the Veteran's last day of marginal income, was July 31, 2020. 

By way of history, the Veteran submitted an initial claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder on May 22, 2019. In a July 2021 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for an anxiety disorder, assigning a 50 percent disability rating effective May 22, 2019, the date of claim. On March 17, 2022, within one year of the July 2021 rating decision, the Veteran filed a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, where the Veteran sought a TDIU based on her service-connected disabilities, to include her service-connected anxiety disorder. The AOJ construed this application as both an increased rating claim and a TDIU claim. In developing the TDIU claim, the AOJ afforded the Veteran an examination in December 2022 to assess the severity of her service-connected anxiety disorder and, by rating decision dated in December 2022, the AOJ increased the Veteran's disability rating for her psychiatric disability from 50 to 70 percent disabling effective March 17, 2022, the date of her formal claim for a TDIU. The Veteran appealed this decision, and, in February 2025, the Board granted found that the Veteran had met the criteria for a 70 percent disability rating since October 1, 2021, as this is the date she last worked according to her formal claim for a TDIU. 

Significantly, in its February 2025 decision, the Board found that because the Veteran did not file a review option (an appeal to the Board, a Supplemental Claim or a request Higher-level Review) within one year of the July 2021 rating decision, the Veteran had not continuously pursued her claim since May 22, 2019. The Board, in its February 2025 decision, noted that the March 2022 TDIU application could not support continuous pursuit. 38C.F.R. §3.2500. However, in a recent decision of the Court of Appeals of Veterans Claims, the Court found that when a veteran is seeking higher ratings for their service-connected disabilities by applying for a TDIU, the TDIU application (VA Form 21-8940) may serve as a supplemental claim in the AMA when it is filed after VA denies increased ratings for those disabilities. Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028 (March 13, 2025). 

Considering the above, while the Veteran did not submit a formal claim for a TDIU until March 2022, the Board took jurisdiction over the TDIU claim as part and parcel of the claim for an increased initial evaluation of the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disorder pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22?Vet. App.?447 (2009). Notably, the psychiatric disorder claim originated from an initial claim for service connection beginning March 22, 2019. Furthermore, as above, while the Veteran last worked on October 7, 2021, the Veteran has not been gainfully employed since August 1, 2020. As such, the Board finds that a claim for a TDIU has been pending since at least August 1, 2020.

However, while the Veteran met the schedular criteria for a TDIU from October 1, 2021, to October 7, 2021, she did not meet the schedular criteria for a TDIU prior to October 1, 2021. As above, the Veteran had a combined disability rating of 50 percent beginning May 22, 2019, and 70 percent beginning October 1, 2021. 38?C.F.R. §?4.25. 

As such, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render her unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment from October 1, 2021, to the present. 

As above, a review of the record shows that, from August 1, 2020, to October 7, 2021, the Veteran was only making $5,280 per year which is far under the USDBC poverty threshold for one person in 2020. Such is competent and credible evidence that the Veteran has been unable to obtain and maintain substantially gainful employment since August 1, 2020. 

Therefore, the Board finds that a TDIU is warranted effective October 1, 2021, as the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran met the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) and was unable to secure or maintain substantially gainful employment since this time. In short, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that a TDIU is warranted effective October 1, 2021. 

As to whether a TDIU is warranted on an extraschedular basis prior to October 1, 2021, the Board is remanding this issue for referral to the Director, Compensation Service pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b).

REASONS FOR REMAND

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to October 1, 2021, on an extraschedular basis, is remanded.

As above, the Board finds that the Veteran's claim for a TDIU has been pending since his May 22, 2019. Even though the Veteran does not qualify for a TDIU prior to October 1, 2021, pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a), it is the established policy of VA that all Veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.?Therefore, rating boards should submit to the Director, Compensation Service, for extra-schedular consideration all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(a). 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b).?The Board does not have the authority to assign an extraschedular total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability in the first instance.?See Bowling v. Principi, 15?Vet. App.?1 (2001).??? 

Given the fact that the Veteran was neither substantially nor gainfully employed during the pendency of the appeal period, under the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b), the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to October 1, 2021, should be submitted to the Director of Compensation Service for a determination as to whether a TDIU should be awarded on an extra-schedular rating basis prior to October 1, 2021.? 

Accordingly, the matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Refer this case to the Under Secretary for Benefits of the Director, Compensation Service, for consideration of assignment of an extraschedular TDIU under the provisions of 38?C.F.R. §?4.16(b) prior to October 1, 2021.? 

Attention is invited to the March 2022 VA Form 21-8940 showing that, from August 1, 2020, to October 7, 2021, the Veteran was only making $5,280 per year which is far under the USDBC poverty threshold for one person in 2020
