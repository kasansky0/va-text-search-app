REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1986 to October 1990.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision, which granted service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae and assigned a noncompensable evaluation effective June 26, 2021.

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in November 2023 and elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board could not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the case, any evidence that the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Upon review, the Board finds that a remand is needed to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

In a July 2021correspondence, the Veteran indicated he had received treatment for PFB from Dr. M.V. (initials used to protect privacy), a private treatment provider, and requested that VA obtain his records from Dr. M.V.  The Veteran listed the date range for his treatment and provided Dr. M.V.'s address.  In August 2021, the Veteran again listed Dr. M.V.'s address on another VA Form 21-4142.  Later that month, he also submitted a portion of a May 2021 treatment record from Dr. M.P.V. showing he had been directed to use Triamcinolone cream 0.1% and Benzoyl Peroxide wash to treat his PFB.  However, it does not appear that an attempt was made to obtain all of the records from that physician.  Thus, on remand, the AOJ should attempt to obtain any such outstanding records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

The AOJ should request that the appellant provide the names and addresses of any and all health care providers who have provided treatment for his pseudofolliculitis barbae.  A specific request should be made for records from Dr. M.V. See July 2021 and August 2021 VA Form 21-4142s.  After acquiring this information and obtaining any necessary authorization, the AOJ should obtain and associate these records with the claims file.

All attempts and responses should be documented in the claims file.
