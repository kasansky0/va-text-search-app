ORDER

The appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the October 2023 award of increased and separate ratings for a low back disability and a right hip disability, and the award of a total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU). The appeal is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.

2. The October 2023 decision granting increased and separate compensable ratings for the low back disability and right hip disability and granting TDIU was not the initial decision with respect to the case.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for eligibility to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past due benefits awarded in the October 2023 rating decision have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5904; 38 C.F.R. § 14.636.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from March 1989 to December 1991. He served in Southwest Asia.

The appellant is the Veteran's former attorney.

The fee decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision on the issue of attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

On an October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the direct review docket. The Veteran did not elect to change the docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 fee decision on appeal, and a brief or argument filed by the Veteran if received within 30 days of the January 5, 2024, notice of the substance of the NOD. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.400 20.405.

Whether the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on past-due benefits awarded in an October 2023 rating decision.

A claimant may have attorney or agent representation for the prosecution of claims for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5904. 

A power of attorney, executed on either VA Form 21-22, "Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative," or VA Form 21-22a, "Appointment of Attorney or Agent as Claimant's Representative," is required to represent a claimant before VA and to authorize VA's disclosure of information to any person or organization representing a claimant before the Department. Without the signature of a person providing representation for a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited Veterans service organization (VSO) representative, agent, or attorney, the appointment is invalid, and the person appointed to provide representation is under no obligation to do so. The power of attorney shall meet the following requirements:  (1) Contain signature by:  (i) The claimant, or (ii) The claimant's guardian, or (iii) In the case of an incompetent, minor, or otherwise incapacitated person without a guardian, the following in the order named - spouse, parent, other relative or friend (if interests are not adverse), or the director of the hospital in which the claimant is maintained; and (iv) An individual providing representation on a particular claim under § 14.630 of this part or an accredited VSO representative, agent, or attorney; and (2) Shall be presented to the appropriate VA office for filing in the Veteran's claims folder. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a). A power of attorney may be revoked at any time, and an agent or attorney may be discharged at any time. Unless a claimant specifically indicates otherwise, the receipt of a new power of attorney executed by the claimant and the organization or individual providing representation shall constitute a revocation of an existing power of attorney. 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(f)(1). 

All agreements for the payment of fees for services of agents and attorneys must be in writing and signed by both the claimant or appellant and the agent or attorney. To be valid, a fee agreement must include the following:  the name of the Veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran; the name of any disinterested third-party payer and the relationship between the third-party payer and the Veteran, claimant, or appellant; the applicable VA file number; and the specific terms under which the amount to be paid for the services of the attorney or agent will be determined. Fee agreements must also clearly specify if VA is to pay the agent or attorney directly out of past-due benefits. A direct-pay fee agreement is a fee agreement between the claimant or appellant and an agent or attorney providing for payment of fees out of past-due benefits awarded directly to an agent or attorney. A fee agreement that does not clearly specify that VA is to pay the agent or attorney out of past-due benefits or that specifies a fee greater than 20 percent of past-due benefits awarded by VA shall be considered to be an agreement in which the agent or attorney is responsible for collecting any fees for representation from the claimant without assistance from VA. A copy of a direct pay fee agreement must be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) within 30 days of its execution. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(g); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d).

Agents and attorneys may not charge fees for services provided before the date on which a claimant or appellant is provided notice of the AOJ's initial decision with respect to the case. This limitation does not apply to fees charged, allowed, or paid for services provided with respect to proceedings before a court. 38 U.S.C. § 5904(c)(1). An attorney or agent may charge fees when past-due benefits are awarded after a Veteran has filed a supplemental claim because the decision after the supplemental claim is not the initial decision with respect to the case. See Military Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1138-1141 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (MVA). A case, for fees purposes, encompasses all potential claims raised by the evidence, applying all relevant laws and regulations. See, e.g., Perciavalle v. McDonough, 74 F.4th 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2023). A supplemental claim is any complete claim for a VA benefit on an application form prescribed by the Secretary where an initial or supplemental claim for the same or similar benefit on the same or similar basis was previously decided. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p)(2). In certain circumstances, a supplemental claim need not be filed on a specified VA supplemental claim form and may be submitted on a separate form, such as the VA Form 21-8940. See Chisholm v. Collins, No. 22-7028, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *16-*20 (March 13, 2025). A claim for service connection and a subsequent claim for an increased rating are not the same case. See id., at *10-*11; see also, Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024). However, an attorney or agent may charge fees for the filing of a supplemental claim requesting review of the initial rating assigned for a disability after the grant of service connection, including whether TDIU is warranted. See Chisholm, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336, at *11. The initial rating assigned is part of the claim for service connection and, therefore, part of the service connection case. See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006). 

When a claimant or appellant and an attorney or agent have entered into a fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee payable to the agent or attorney (i) is to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim, and (ii) is contingent on whether the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant, the total fee payable to the attorney or agent may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim. A claim shall be considered to have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant or appellant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5904(d); 38 C.F.R. §§ 14.636(h)(1), 14.636(h)(2). 

Fees which do not exceed 20 percent of any past-due benefits awarded shall be presumed to be reasonable if the agent or attorney provided representation that continued through the date of the decision awarding benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(f)(1).

The term "past-due benefits" means a nonrecurring payment resulting from a benefit, or benefits, granted on appeal or awarded on the basis of a readjudicated claim after a denial by an AOJ or the Board or the lump sum payment that represents the total amount of recurring cash payments that accrued between the effective date of the award and the date of the grant of the benefit by the AOJ, the Board, or an appellate court. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3). The fees are payable to the attorney based on the amount of past-due benefits awarded regardless of the amount payable to the Veteran. See Rosinski v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 264 (2020); see also Gumpenberger v. Wilkie, 973 F.3d 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Jackson v. McDonald, 635 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Snyder v. Nicholson, 489 F.3d 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2007). 

When the benefit granted on appeal, or as the result of the readjudicated claim, is service connection for a disability, the "past-due benefits" will be based on the initial disability rating assigned by the AOJ following the award of service connection. The sum will equal the payments accruing from the effective date of the award to the date of the initial disability rating decision. If an increased rating is subsequently granted as the result of an appeal of the disability rating initially assigned by the AOJ, and if the agent or attorney represents the claimant or appellant in that phase of the claim, the agent or attorney will be paid a supplemental payment based upon the increase granted on appeal, to the extent that the increased amount of disability is found to have existed between the initial effective date of the award following the grant of service connection and the date of the rating action implementing the appellate decision granting the increase. 38 C.F.R. § 14.636(h)(3)(i).

In December 2021, the Veteran completed a VA Form 21-22a on which he appointed the appellant as his attorney. At that same time, the Veteran and the appellant executed a fee agreement which stated that the appellant was entitled to fees of 20 percent of any past-due benefit awarded to the Veteran, and that the fee was to be paid directly to the appellant by VA. The Veteran's appointment of the appellant as his attorney and the associated fee agreement are valid.

In a July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), low back degenerative arthritis, right hip osteoarthritis, and a right knee strain with bursitis and a lateral tear. In a July 2022 decision, the AOJ awarded the appellant fees based on the past-due benefits granted in the July 2022 rating decision.

In April 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-8940 on which he contended, in part, that his PTSD, back, right hip, and right knee contributed to his inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation. In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ, in part, granted past-due benefits of an increased rating for the low back and granted separate compensable ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy; granted an increased rating for the right hip and granted a separate compensable rating for impairment of the thigh; and granted TDIU. The separate ratings were granted to compensate the Veteran for additional symptoms of his low back and right hip disabilities and were part of the increased rating claims. The increased and separate ratings were effective in April 2023, and TDIU was effective in December 2021. The rating decision stated that the evidence indicated that the Veteran's low back, right hip, right knee, and PTSD impacted his ability to perform occupational tasks. TDIU was granted based on the combined effects of the Veteran's service connected disabilities. In an October 2023 decision, the AOJ denied fees to the appellant. On an October 2023 VA Form 10182, the appellant appealed the denial of fees. In June 2024, the appellant withdrew his representation of the Veteran.

The appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the October 2023 grants of past-due benefits. In July 2022, the AOJ assessed the severity of the Veteran's PTSD, low back, right knee, and right hip disabilities. In July 2022, the appellant was separately paid fees for the past-due benefits granted in that decision. In April 2023, within one year of the July 2022 rating decision, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21 8940. This form can constitute a supplemental claim or constitute a new claim. See Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025). In this case, the April 2023 claim was challenging the initial disability ratings, including whether TDIU was warranted, and filed within a year of the July 2022 rating decision; as such, it is considered a supplemental claim. Additionally, entitlement to a TDIU was part and parcel of the initial ratings adjudicated in the July 2022 rating decision. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Therefore, the October 2023 rating decision is not the initial decision on the initial disability ratings for the low back and right hip, or for a TDIU. As the October 2023 rating decision is not the initial decision with respect to the case on these issues, the appellant is eligible to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in the October 2023 rating decision. The appeal is granted.
