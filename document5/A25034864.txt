2. The February 7, 2025 Board Appeal request is not timely with respect to the rating decision issued on March 22, 2019, that denied service connection for cause of death, DIC under 38 U.S.C. sections 1151 and 1318, and the criteria for an extension of time to file a Board Appeal request have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.109(b), 3.2500(a), 20.202, 20.203. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to March 1972. Unfortunately, he died in January 2017. His surviving spouse is the Appellant. The Appellant filed a February, 7, 2025 Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the January 28, 2019 rating decisions and selecting the Hearing docket. 

The Board recognizes that the Appellant requested a hearing. Hearings are provided to appellants who properly request one in association with appellate review of a VA decision.?38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.302. In this case, the Board has not accepted appellate review, and no hearing will be provided.  

Timeliness of an Appeal

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), an appeal consists of a properly completed Notice of Disagreement (NOD, Board Appeal request) on the form prescribed by the Secretary submitted to the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(b)(1)(A); 38?C.F.R. §§?3.2500(a)(1), 20.202, 20.203. A question as to the timeliness or adequacy of a Board Appeal request shall be decided by the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(1)(C). 

An extension of the period for filing Board Appeal request may be granted for good cause. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Id. When an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38?C.F.R. §?3.109(b). Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §?20.203(c). 

Examples of good cause may include serious illness or injury of the appellant or representative, or the appellant's inability to access mail services due to homelessness, or overseas deployment. Examples that would not constitute good cause include change in representation, change in preference of a review option at the AOJ or among the Board review options, difficulty in obtaining evidence, or discovery of new evidence during a period in which the duty to assist does not apply. 84 Fed. Reg. 138, 155 (Jan. 18, 2019).  

Timeliness of the February 7, 2025, Board Appeal request.  

On February 7, 2025, the Appellant filed a Board Appeal request seeking to appeal the rating decision issued on July 6, 2017, that denied DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 and service connection for cause of death and the rating decision issued on March 22, 2019, that denied service connection for cause of death, DIC under 38 U.S.C. sections 1151 and 1318. The Appellant asserts that good cause exists to extend the time to file an appeal. See February 7, 2025 VA Form 10182.

For the reasons explained below, the Board concludes that the attempted appeal was not timely and good cause has not been presented to warrant an extension of time to file an appeal from the rating decisions issued on July 6, 2017, and March 22, 2019. 

On March 15, 2017, the Appellant submitted an application for burial benefits and an application for DIC, death pension, and/or accrued benefits. The rating decision July 6, 2017, denied DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 and service connection for cause of death. The Appellant was notified of the decision in a July 6, 2017, letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Appellant's address of record and was not returned as undeliverable.

On August 2, 2017, the Appellant appointed a representative and requested to be substituted for the Veteran in any pending claims or appeals. On October 25, 2017, the Appellant filed a VA Form 9, perfecting an appeal in the Legacy system in which she had been substituted for the Veteran and requesting a copy of the claims file. On August 8, 2018, the Appellant attended a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge regarding the Legacy system appeal. On August 20, 2018, VA received a letter from the Appellant regarding the appeal. 

On November 28, 2018, the Appellant filed an application for DIC, death pension, and/or accrued benefits. A rating decision dated January 28, 2019 denied service connection for cause of death, DIC under 38 U.S.C. sections 1151 and 1318. The Appellant was notified of the decision in a March 22, 2019, letter that included appeal rights and instructions for filing an appeal to the Board. The letter was sent to the Appellant's address of record and to the Appellant's representative and was not returned as undeliverable.

On September 13, 2019, the Appellant's representative submitted a change of address request. On November 12, 2019, the Appellant's representative submitted a letter and a Notice of Disagreement asking VA to consider it a Notice of Disagreement with an October 2019 rating decision. On the same day, the Appellant submitted a Higher-Level Review request, requesting review of the same October 2019 rating decision. 

On March 25, 2020, the Appellant submitted a letter inquiring about the Veteran's 2017 award letter and whether the Veteran was compensated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or unemployment. On April 30, 2020, the Appellant's representative submitted argument regarding the Legacy system appeal, which had been vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. In July 2020, the Appellant submitted letters in support of the Legacy TDIU claim. 

The Veteran's representative submitted an October 2020, letter requesting the status of the Veteran's claim and a January 2021, letter advising VA of the representative's address change. On February 4, 2021, the Appellant submitted an intent to file. On March 30, 2021, the Appellant informed VA that she had fired her representative and submitted a letters to that effect and in support of the Veteran's pending claims. 

In April 2021, the Appellant submitted a second application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. Along with a statement and an April 14, 2021, letter rejected the application because it was incomplete. The Appellant continued to submit documents during April, May, June, August, October, and December of 2021. In August 2022, the Appellant initiated a debt disagreement dispute claim. The Appellant submitted a February 2023 statement generally in support of her claims. In March 2023, the Appellant submitted another application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation. In April 2023, the Appellant submitted a letter in support of her debt dispute claim. In March 2024, the Appellant submitted another Dependency and Indemnity Compensation claim. In June and October 2024, the Appellant submitted another letter in support of her debt dispute claim. In October 2024, the Appellant submitted a Board Appeal request with respect to her debt dispute claim. The Appellant submitted another Dependency and Indemnity Compensation claim in October 2024, along with a statement asking for help to file her claim. In a November 8, 2024, letter, VA rejected the application because it was incomplete and provided instructions on how to obtain assistance from VA. The Appellant submitted another Dependency and Indemnity Compensation claim form in January 2025. 

The Appellant's February 7, 2025, Board Appeal request was not timely filed because it was received more than one year after the rating decisions issued on July 6, 2017, and March 22, 2019. 

While the Appellant asserted that there is good cause to extend the time to file an appeal from the rating decisions issued on July 6, 2017, and March 22, 2019, the Veteran did not appear to provide an explanation for why the VA Form 10182 was not timely filed. In the February 7, 2025, Board Appeal request, she provided reasons that the underlying Dependency and Indemnity Compensation claim should be granted and included details about an overpayment, but she did not provide an explanation for why she could not have filed the Board Appeal request within the one-year appeal period, nor has she explained why she was unable to file her Board Appeal request earlier than she did. As noted above, the Veteran filed numerous documents and submitted numerous statements within the one-year appeal period for the rating decisions issued on July 6, 2017, and March 22, 2019, and prior to the February 7, 2025 Board Appeal request. 

The Veteran's representative submitted an appellate brief, but it does not appear to provide an explanation of the purported good cause for why the Board Appeal request was not timely filed or filed earlier than it was.

Accordingly, the February 7, 2025, Board Appeal request was not timely filed with respect to the rating decision issued on July 6, 2017, that denied DIC under 38 U.S.C. § 1318 and service connection for cause of death and the rating decision issued on March 22, 2019, that denied service connection for cause of death, DIC under 38 U.S.C. sections 1151 and 1318, and service connection for cause of death is denied, and good cause has not been shown to accept the late filing. The extension requests are denied and the attempted appeals are dismissed.
