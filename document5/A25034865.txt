REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1980 to December 1986. 

This claim comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an October 11, 2022, rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The appeal will therefore be considered pursuant to the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). See Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). In the October 2022 decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) made several determinations, including to confirm and continue denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hip strain, lumbosacral strain, GERD, and ED, after receiving new and relevant evidence in association with the VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Applications received from the Veteran in June 2022 and July 2022. The Board is bound by the favorable finding that new and relevant evidence was received warranting readjudication. 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). On November 4, 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)) and selected the Direct Review Docket. 

Under the AMA, the evidentiary record the Board may consider depends on the evidence considered by the AOJ in the decision on appeal and the Veteran's docket selection on the NOD. The present appeal stems from disagreement with the October 11, 2022, rating decision which considered the evidence of record at the time. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400; 3.2500; 3.2601. As indicated above, the Veteran selected the Direct Review Docket when submitting the NOD in November 2022. The Board may therefore only consider the evidence of record at the time of October 11, 2022, rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).

In this regard, the Board acknowledges that the appellant submitted evidence along with the NOD, which cannot be considered due to his election of the Direct Review Docket. See Correspondence, received November 4, 2022. The submission of new evidence with a Direct Review Docket election can require the Board to seek clarification from the Veteran. See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). However, the Board finds that the appellant is not prejudiced by the Board's failure to seek clarification of the appellant's NOD docket election, as the Board is remanding the appeal and any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ upon adjudication. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection - Relevant Rules and Regulations

Under the AMA, the Board must remand to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors (including when the AOJ failed to make reasonable efforts to obtain VA treatment records or relevant federal or private treatment records, failed to obtain a VA examination, or provided an inadequate VA examination or opinion). 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Additionally, under the AMA, the Board may remand for correction of any other error by the AOJ in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim, not just pre-decisional duty to assist errors. Id.

Typically, establishing service connection requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In certain situations, service connection may be granted for a disability that is the result of a service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Harder v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 183, 187 (1993). The controlling regulation has been interpreted to permit a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation of a non-service-connected disability by a service-connected disability. See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

Service connection may also be granted under certain theories of presumption. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. In circumstances where any of the theories are applicable, certain diseases are presumed under the law to have had their onset in service even though there is no evidence of that disease during the applicable period of service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a). For instance, chronic diseases listed under section 1101(3) of the statute and section 3.309(a) of VA regulations are presumed to have been incurred in service if manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). When a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by showing a continuity of symptomatology after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). The use of continuity of symptoms to establish service connection is limited only to those diseases listed at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

Veterans stationed at Camp Lejeune for more than 30 days during the period from August 1, 1953, to December 31, 1987, are presumed exposed to contaminated water. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(7). The recently passed Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), allows for presumptive service connection in conjunction with a Veteran's exposure to toxic materials to include contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168; see also Pub. L. No. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). TERA participation may also be established when a Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) is associated with toxic exposure or when medical records suggest exposure to a toxic substance, chemical, or airborne hazard. 

Generally speaking, when evidence of TERA participation during active military service is implicated, and such evidence is not sufficient to establish service connection for the disability, the Secretary shall provide the Veteran with a medical examination and secure a nexus opinion unless VA determines that there is no assertion that the claimed disorder is related to the TERA. Id. To that end, VA has indicated that conditions including, but not limited to, fracture, joint dislocation, certain forms of arthritis which resulted from physical trauma, and mental disorders are not to be considered presumptive disabilities for purposes of establishing entitlement to service connection pursuant to the PACT Act. Id.

Entitlement to Service Connection for Right and Left Hip Strain

Entitlement to Service Connection for Lumbosacral Strain

Entitlement to Service Connection for GERD

Entitlement to Service Connection for ED

The Veteran contends that the claimed bilateral hip strain, lumbosacral strain, GERD, and ED, is caused by the service-connected left knee degenerative arthritis with limitation of extension and flexion. See NOD, received November 4, 2022. 

The AOJ has conceded the Veteran's diagnosed bilateral hip, lumbosacral strain, GERD, and ED disabilities, and that the primary knee disabilities (limitation of extension and flexion) are service connected. See Rating Decision - Narrative, received October 11, 2022. The Veteran's exposure to toxic chemicals by way of his MOS as an 'A/C Repair Tech' has also been conceded. Id.; see also DD Form 214. The Board is bound by these findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) also suggest that he served at Camp Lejeune from December 1983 to February 1984. See STR - Medical at 37, received April 5, 2010. This could potentially constitute additional TERA participation as well as a presumption of contaminated water exposure. Although the Veteran's disabilities are not included in the diseases subject to presumptive service connection due to exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f), a non-presumptive disease may still be entitled to service connection on a direct basis if the medical evidence supports a relationship between that disease and exposure to contaminated water.  See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (1994).

Unfortunately, based on the current evidence, the Board is unable to make any determination as to whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection for any of the claimed conditions under any theories of service connection. Though the Veteran attended VA examinations in December 2020 and March 2022, none of the medical opinions provided in conjunction with those examinations included a discussion of aggravation, either from the service-connected left knee disabilities or the over-the-counter medications the Veteran uses to better control his symptoms. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim, received December 21, 2021; see also El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013) (a medical opinion regarding secondary service connection must address both causation and aggravation to be adequate). The opinions are therefore insufficient for rating purposes and new opinions must be obtained. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) ("Once [VA] undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service-connection claim . . . [VA] must provide an adequate one"). The Board further notes the record is absent any evidence indicating that the AOJ took action to verify the Veteran's service at Camp Lejeune or to obtain medical opinions based on his TERA participation.  

Based on the foregoing, the AOJ committed pre-decisional duty to assist errors in failing to provide sufficiently rationalized medical opinions that address the Veteran's TERA participation, where applicable, and address other theories of entitlement that were raised prior to adjudication. Remand is therefore warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.	Take all reasonable steps to verify the Veteran's active-duty service at Camp Lejeune. See STR - Medical at 37, received April 5, 2010. 

2.	Thereafter, request an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's right and left hip strain, lumbosacral strain, GERD, and ED disabilities. After reviewing the claims file, the examiner is asked to identify all right and left hip strain, lumbosacral strain, GERD, and ED disabilities. PLEASE NOTE: "pain" causing functional impairment of earning capacity is considered a "disability" for VA purposes; and if an opinion cannot be completed without full examination, then one should be scheduled.

(a.)	For each identified disability, opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that it: (i) manifested during active-duty service; (ii) manifested within one year after discharge; or (iii) is otherwise due to the Veteran's active-duty service?

(b.)	For each identified disability, opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that it: (i) was caused by the service-connected left knee disability; or (ii) was aggravated by the service-connected left knee disability? PLEASE NOTE: permanent worsening need NOT be shown, ANY increase in disability is sufficient to demonstrate aggravation.

(c.)	For each identified disability, opine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that it: (i) was caused by the medication the Veteran takes to help control the symptoms associated with the service-connected left knee disability; or (ii) was aggravated by any of the medication the Veteran takes to help control the symptoms associated with the service-connected left knee disability? PLEASE NOTE: permanent worsening need NOT be shown, ANY increase in disability is sufficient to demonstrate aggravation.

(d.)	For each identified disability that is not claimed as a result of any reported physical trauma, opine whether it is at least as likely as not that it was caused by or is otherwise due to an in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), such as the Veteran's exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. In providing this opinion, the reporting clinician should consider: (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

The Veteran is competent to testify as to the nature and severity of any symptomatology and the onset of any symptoms.

If there is a medical reason to doubt the accuracy of the Veteran's statements this should be clearly expressed with a rationale as supported by the evidence.

A full rationale for any opinion offered should be provided. If an opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so and note what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.
