ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran has left or right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1981 to April 2005.  He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force, including service in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.  The Board thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes a supplemental claim decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

By way of background, the matter on appeal was previously denied in a February 2020 rating decision.  In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the matter most recently addressed in  the February 2020 rating decision.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Service connection may be granted for disability due to disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) a disease, injury, or event in service; and (3) a nexus or causal relationship between the claimed disability and the disease, injury, or event in service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability.  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  The requirement for current disability is satisfied when the claimant has a disability at the time a claim for service connection is filed or during the pendency of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).  A disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1110 refers to functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (2018).  However, subjective complaints of pain in the absence of objective evidence of functional impairment are not sufficient to show a current disability for VA purposes.  Id. at 1367-68.

VA has specifically defined what is meant by a "disability" for the purposes of service connection: "[i]mpaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent."  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

In an January 2024 VA examination report audiological evaluation, puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25	25	25	25	30

LEFT	25	25	25	25	30

The Veteran's speech discrimination score was 94 percent in the right ear and 98 percent in the left ear using the Maryland CNC speech recognition test.  

Prior to the period on appeal, in a December 2019 VA examination report audiological evaluation, puretone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	15	15	15	15

LEFT	20	20	15	20	20

The Veteran's speech discrimination score was 98 percent in the right ear and 96 percent in the left ear using the Maryland CNC speech recognition test.

The Board recognizes that a favorable finding in the rating decision on appeal was that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability as a January 2024 VA contract examination confirmed current diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (in frequency range of 500-4000 Hz or higher frequencies). However, the Board does not interpret this favorable finding to mean that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability in either ear for VA compensation purposes, but only that the Veteran has some degree of hearing loss. In Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993) the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the threshold for normal hearing is from 0 to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the favorable finding can be read to state that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability in both ears for VA compensation purposes, such a statement is clearly and unmistakably erroneous. Neither the January 2024 VA contract examination nor any other evidence available for the Board's review reflects hearing loss in either ear that meets any of the 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 criteria during or proximate to the appeal period.

Based on these audiometric findings, the Veteran has not had puretone thresholds of 40 decibels at any frequency or of 26 decibels or higher in at least three of the frequencies in either ear at any time during the appeal, or even prior to the period on appeal.  Moreover, no speech recognition score using the Maryland CNC Test was less than 94 percent in either ear.  Thus, although the Veteran may have decreased hearing acuity in both ears, this is not sufficient to establish that he has a left or right ear hearing loss disability for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The Board observes that in a February 2020 opinion, the December 2019 VA examiner noted moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss in the 2019 examination, and that in a December 2023 opinion, a private otolaryngologist noted bilateral sensorineural hearing loss but included no audiometric findings; again, however, this is not sufficient to establish left or right ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Hence, after reviewing all the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against finding that the Veteran had left or right ear hearing loss under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 current during (or proximate to) the period on appeal.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and entitlement to service connection is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
