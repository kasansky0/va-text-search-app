ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a right hip strain is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his right hip strain is at least as likely as not related to his hip injury during Basic Training.

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his unspecified anxiety disorder is at least as likely as not related to his active military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a right hip strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army National Guard with active service from October 2011 to October 2012, January 2013 to November 2013, and June 2014 to August 2014.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized review system, or Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In November 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of May 2020 and March 2020 decisions. In March 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior decisions.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May and March 2020 decisions and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May and March 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right hip strain is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a right hip strain that he contends began while he was in training in the military. See September 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current right hip strain disability. The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

Therefore, the remaining questions before the Board are if the Veteran's right hip strain had an in-service incurrence or aggravation and if there is a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show the Veteran noted he was bothered a little by pain in the arms, legs, or joints (including hips) in October 2013. The records do not differentiate which body part he was referring to. See STRs.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2020. The Veteran reported to the examiner that he had injured his hip when he stepped into a pothole during Basic Training. The examiner opined that the Veteran's right hip strain was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by his hip pain during service. The examiner took into account the Veteran's history, service treatment records, and current examination. The examiner noted he did not find any instances of hip treatment in the Veteran's service treatment record, but he found the Veteran's report to be sufficient. See February 2020 Medical Opinion Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

There is no medical opinion to the contrary.

Taking all evidence into account and resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's right hip strain was caused by an in-service injury. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for a right hip strain is warranted, and the appeal is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder, which he originally claimed as posttraumatic stress disorder, that began during his deployment to Afghanistan. See September 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When a Veteran seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the Veteran prevails. Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). The benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In the March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current unspecified anxiety disorder disability. The Board is bound by this favorable finding.

Therefore, the remaining questions before the Board are if the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder had an in-service incurrence or aggravation and if there is a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.

During a post-deployment health reassessment in October 2013, the Veteran reported he encountered bodies or saw people killed or wounded. He declined a mental health referral at the time. See STRs.

A review of the medical records shows the Veteran sought mental health treatment in 2016. He reported experiencing symptoms of anxiety and nightmares after his deployment to Afghanistan in 2013. He was diagnosed with anxiety. See Medical Records.

In May 2020, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The Veteran was diagnosed with unspecified anxiety disorder. The Veteran described to the examiner an incident that took place while deployed to Afghanistan. The examiner opined that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder was at least as likely as not incurred in or caused by his military service because service treatment records show reports of sleep difficulty post-deployment and complaints of anxiety and treatment sought due to anxiety. See May 2020 Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

There is no medical opinion to the contrary.

Taking all evidence into account and resolving doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's unspecified anxiety disorder was caused by an in-service event. Therefore, entitlement to service connection for an unspecified anxiety disorder is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
