ORDER

Service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. PTSD is not etiologically related to a verified in-service stressor.

2. An acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD is not etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304.

2. The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Army from January 1979 to May 1979.

An initial rating decision was issued in November 2022; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In his December 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Veteran separately appealed decisions denying service connection for depression and for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  The Board will address these as a single issue.  Because the criteria for service connection for PTSD are different from those of service connection generally, that claim will remain separate.

PTSD

Entitlement to service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) credible supporting evidence that a claimed in-service stressor occurred; and (3) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and the in-service stressor.  38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f); Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

The November 2022 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a current PTSD diagnosis.  Regarding an in-service stressor, an April 2020 Board decision found the Veteran to be credible when he reported being involved in a fight during basic training.

However, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that PTSD is related to the in-service fight stressor.  VA treatment records from September 2008 show the Veteran was a police officer prior to service, and he was involved in a car chase that ended with a crash killing four people.  The Veteran also reported being molested by a babysitter at age 6.  He also reported being attacked by a neighbor with a machete in 2004.  He was diagnosed with PTSD and his symptoms were related to these pre- and post-service events.  In August 2012, a VA psychiatrist stated that the Veteran had PTSD from witnessing a civilian motor vehicle accident.  Additional VA records from April 2013 show the Veteran's treating psychiatrist attributed PTSD to two non-military traumas, namely responding to a fatal auto accident while serving as a civilian police officer and being attacked by someone with a machete.

The Veteran was afforded VA examinations in November 2019, July 2021, and October 2022, but no examiner diagnosed PTSD.  There is no competent medical opinion linking the Veteran's PTSD to the fight in service or any other circumstance of service.  To the extent that the Veteran has asserted such a connection, he has not shown the necessary medical knowledge or expertise to provide a competent nexus in this case.  The issue is medically complex, as it requires specialized knowledge of psychiatric disorders and the ability to interpret mental status examinations.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence, which does not establish a link between PTSD and service.

Acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The November 2022 rating decision favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of major depressive disorder.  Regarding service, the Veteran's January 1979 enlistment examination was normal, and he is presumed to have entered service in sound condition.  In March 1999, he was noted to be experiencing extreme stress over his relocation from Samoa.  Additional records from April 1999 noted that the separation from his family was too much of a strain on any attempt to continue service.  He was subsequently discharged due to an inability to adapt socially or emotionally to military life.

On the question of whether the current depressive disorder is related to service, there are opinions in favor of and against the claim.  In support of the claim, the April 2013 VA psychiatrist which linked PTSD to the Veteran's pre- and post-service stressors also stated that depression seemed to have started from the fight the Veteran had in the military.

In contrast, a November 2019 VA examination stated that the Veteran's depressive disorder was not due to the fight in service, but his other traumatic events, including childhood sexual abuse, the suicide of a relative when the Veteran was 14 years old, his involvement in the car chase as a police officer, being attacked by a neighbor with a machete, and the deaths of his parents.  A July 2021 VA examination stated that depression experienced in the military was due to life circumstances present at the time, whereas current depressive was related to the Veteran's current difficulties, including body pain, an inability to sleep, and a lack of employment.  An October 2022 VA examiner reached a similar conclusion and cited the Veteran's extensive history of nonservice-related traumas.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against a link between the current depressive disorder diagnosis and service.  Although the April 2013 VA psychiatrist linked current depression to the fight in service, this appears to be based solely on the Veteran's statements.  The Veteran reported during that treatment session that his depression related to the fight he had, that he became depressed in service and requested treatment, but was discharged instead.  This is not consistent with service records showing the Veteran's emotional problems were due to relocating from Samoa and the strain of being separated from his family, and that he believed his enlistment to be a mistake.

In contrast, multiple VA examiners determined that the Veteran's depressive disorder was not related to service, including the fight in service or any depression he experienced due to being away from his family.  Rather, depression in service was the result of his circumstances at the time, and his current depression is the result of his present circumstances and other nonservice-related traumas.

To the extent that the Veteran has asserted a link between his current depression and service, he has not shown the necessary medical knowledge or expertise to provide a competent nexus in this case, as discussed above.  Therefore, the claim must be denied.
