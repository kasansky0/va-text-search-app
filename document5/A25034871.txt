REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1974 to September 1994. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2021 administrative decision issued by the VA Regional Office (RO). This decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the June 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence submission docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative within 90 days following the receipt of the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal, or (2) more than 90 days following the receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

CLOTHING ALLOWANCES FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2022

The Board finds that the AOJ committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by failing to associate the Veteran's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) claims file pertaining to his claims for clothing allowances in the calendar year 2021 for a right knee brace, a left knee brace, lidocaine, and Zostrix pain cream, with the electronic record. 

Significantly, review of the available electronic record reveals the Veteran's June 2021 VA Form 10182 as well as relevant medical records from VA Phoenix Healthcare System for the date of service submitted by the Veteran; however, all other relevant evidence has not been associated with the record. The record does not contain the Veteran's initial claim to VHA nor any other VHA records. The Board notes that the June 2021 AOJ decision cited in the Veteran's 2021 application for a clothing allowance, which does not appear to be of record. 

The Board finds that remand to obtain and associate with the electronic record, the Veteran's complete VHA claims file, including any VHA file evidence, to include VA treatment records, relevant private treatment and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran are necessary to determine whether the claims for clothing allowances in the calendar year 2021 for a right knee brace, a left knee brace, lidocaine, and Zostrix pain cream, is warranted.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. The AOJ must reconstruct the Veteran's VHA claims file and associate it with the electronic record, to include obtaining any outstanding VHA file evidence, including any VA treatment records, relevant private treatment records and medical bills, AOJ decision(s), claim(s) for reimbursement, and any statement(s) from the Veteran. In particular, the June 2021 AOJ decision cited in the Veteran's 2021 application for 2021 clothing allowances should be associated with the claims file.

2. The AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability if the records are unable to be obtained.
