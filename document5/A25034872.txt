ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypochromic/microcytic anemia is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypochromic/microcytic anemia has not been shown to have been incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypochromic/microcytic anemia have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Marine Corps Reserves with a period of active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from January 9, 2009 to February 19, 2009.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Hypochromic/Microcytic Anemia  

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to qualify for VA benefits, a claimant must be a veteran. See Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 484 (2006) (holding that status as a "veteran" is one of the five elements of a claim for service-connection benefits). One of the benefits administered by VA that is reserved specifically for veterans is disability compensation. Accordingly, to establish his entitlement to disability compensation benefits, the Appellant must first establish "veteran" status.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), a "veteran" is defined as "a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable." The term "active military, naval, or air service" includes (1) active duty, (2) any period of active duty training (ACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, and (3) any period of inactive duty training (INACDUTRA) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a);  Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 477-78 (1991).

ACDUTRA includes full-time duty performed for training purposes by members of the Reserves. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (c)(1). This refers to the two weeks of annual training which each Reservist must perform each year. It may also refer to the Reservist's initial period of training.  INACDUTRA includes duty, other than full-time duty, performed for training purposes by members of the Reserves. 38 U.S.C. § 101 (23); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6 (d). This refers to the twelve four-hour weekend drills that each Reservist or National Guardsman must perform each year. These drills are deemed to be part-time training.

For service connection to be granted for any disability resulting from injury or disease incurred during the remainder of his service, it must be shown that the claimed disability first manifested in or underwent a permanent worsening during a verified period of ACDUTRA or INACDUTRA, depending on the nature of the claimed disability.

For the following reasons, the Board finds that service connection for hypochromic/microcytic anemia is not warranted.

For an ACDUTRA claimant to establish a service-connected disability based on aggravation of a preexisting condition sufficient to confer veteran status, the claimant must demonstrate "direct evidence both that a worsening of the condition occurred during the period of [ACDUTRA] and that the worsening was caused by the period of [ACDUTRA]." Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 48 (2010). Unlike a claimant who served on active duty, a claimant who served only on ACDUTRA cannot rely on the presumptions of soundness or aggravation to demonstrate that a preexisting condition was aggravated in service.  See Donnellan, 24 Vet. App. at 175. Rather, such claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that a claimed condition preexisted service and was aggravated therein, the latter of which can only be shown by submitting evidence of "a permanent increase in disability beyond the natural progress of that disease or injury during [the] period of [ACDUTRA]." Id. at 174-75.

In this case, a March 2024 VA examination reports indicates the Veteran's diagnosis a of hypochromic/microcytic anemia. However, there is no medical or lay evidence to indicate the Veteran's anemia was incurred in or aggravated during his period of ACDUTRA. The Veteran's personnel records show he was ordered to ACDUTRA on January 9, 2009 for the officer candidate course program. A February 18, 2019 service treatment records (STRs) shows a diagnosis of hypochromic/microcytic anemia. The Veteran was not physically qualified (NPQ) for this condition as he was not worked up for it formally and his previous treatment was over-the-counter iron which he initiated. A line of duty (LOD) was not recommended as the Veteran was aware of this condition at approximately age 19. Disenrollment from officer candidate course program then occurred on February 19, 2009 due to anemia.  

A March 2024 VA examination report shows the examiner opined that the Veteran's claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner's rationale was there is a lack of substantiating evidence supporting a nexus between the current diagnosis of anemia and military service.  

While the VA examiner did not render an opinion as to whether the Veteran's anemia was aggravated during his period of ACDUTRA, the opinion constitutes evidence against the claim and is entitled to some probative weight. Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 107 (2012) ("even if a medical opinion is inadequate to decide a claim, it does not necessarily follow that the opinion is entitled to absolutely no probative weight"; "it may be given some weight based upon the amount of information and analysis it contains").

To the extent that the Veteran asserts that hypochromic/microcytic anemia is related to service, either as a preexisting condition that was incurred in or aggravated or otherwise, he is competent to attest to his observations and the etiology of simple medical matters. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). He is not, however, competent to opine on complex medical matters such as the etiology of anemia, which are questions that relate to internal medical process that extend beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship that is of the type that the courts have found to be beyond the competence of lay witnesses. Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007) (unlike varicose veins or a dislocated shoulder, rheumatic fever is not a condition capable of lay diagnosis). To the extent that the Veteran's statements are competent, the specific reasoned opinion of the March 2024 VA examiner is of greater probative weight than the Veteran's more general lay assertions.  Moreover, the Veteran did not indicate that his symptoms worsened during his period of ACDUTRA and without evidence of worsening it cannot be said that a preexisting disorder was aggravated by service.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's hypochromic/microcytic anemia was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during ACDUTRA. Rather, the evidence weighs persuasively against the claim, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
