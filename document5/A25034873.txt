ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided to the Veteran by the appellant in December 2019 (Claim ID 302018200019741000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment for the December 2019 episode of care provided to the Veteran by the appellant.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment for non-VA medical services provided in December 2019 has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant, Clearwater Cardiovascular & Interventional Consultants, is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical services to the Veteran in December 2019.?

In September 2020, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence submission docket to review a decision issued by a VA Medical Center for the December 2019 episode of care.

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical care provided to the Veteran in December 2019 was resurrected and processed for payment while this appeal was pending.  In a July 2024 Report of Contact, VHA indicated that the required authorization had been created after the receipt of the claims related to this episode of care, and that Claim ID 302004100020624000 would be resurrected and processed for payment.

The Board acknowledges that the payment may be less than the full amount of the charges billed by the provider for this episode of care.  If the amount paid for the December 2019 episode of care is disagreeable to the appellant, they may file a separate appeal of that decision pursuant to the relevant regulatory or contractual procedures, as applicable.

Thus, the record reflects that decision(s) have been made reflecting a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
