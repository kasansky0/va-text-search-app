DOCKET NO. 240214-416480
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of August 1, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's cause of death is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Within one year of the Veteran's August 2014 death, the Appellant submitted a Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) claim that was received by VA on October 29, 2014.

2. The Veteran's original DIC claim would have been allowed if the presumptions of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) had been in effect.

3. The Veteran's original DIC claim was denied prior to enactment of the PACT Act and was appealed to the Board.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of August 1, 2014, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1310, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.33, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army from May 1983 to May 2003. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in October 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act. Unfortunately, the Veteran died in August 2014. The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's cause of death.

In February 2024 correspondence, the Appellant contends through her representative that 38 C.F.R. 3.33 applies and that an effective date of November 5, 2015, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's cause of death is warranted.

To establish service connection for the cause of the veteran's death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by active service was either the principal or contributory cause of death. To constitute the principal cause of death, the service-connected disability must be one of the immediate or underlying causes of death or be etiologically related to the cause of death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.312(b).

On August 10, 2022, the President signed into law the PACT Act. Among other things, it established a presumption for pulmonary fibrosis if the Veteran served in Southwest Asia on or after August 2, 1990, without regard to the veteran's base location or military job specialty. See 117 P.L. 168; 2022 Enacted S 3373; 117 Enacted S 3373; 136 Stat. 1759.

Generally, the effective date of an award of service connection for cause of death is the date of receipt of a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If a claim is received within one year of the date of death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran's death occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).

Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2014).

As the PACT Act is considered liberalizing legislation, the effective date of the award for service connection pursuant to the PACT Act is to be assigned commensurate with the date that the law was enacted, August 10, 2022. When an Appellant requests reconsideration of a previously denied DIC claim under the PACT Act, the effective date for the award is determined as if the PACT Act had been in effect on the date of the submission of the original claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.33. This exception also applies for original DIC claims that were denied by the AOJ prior to the enactment of the PACT Act (August 10, 2022) and that are pending before the Board.

In this regard, this case has a long procedural history. The Veteran died in August 2014 and the Appellant submitted an application for the Veteran's cause of death on October 29, 2014, which was denied in a November 2015 rating decision. The Appellant submitted a motion for reconsideration in November 2015 which was denied in a January 2016 rating decision. The Appellant filed a Notice of Disagreement in July 2016, and a Statement of the Case was issued in November 2016. The Appellant submitted a December 2016 VA Form 9, and a March 2018 Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) was issued. The Appellant testified before a Veterans Law Judge in September 2020.

In January 2021, the Board remanded the claim and a March 2021 SSOC was issued. In a July 2021 decision, the Board denied the claim. The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) and the claim was remanded in April 2022 pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand. In August 2022, prior to the passage of the PACT Act, the Board again denied the claim. The Appellant again appealed to the Court and the claim was remanded in June 2023. In an October 2023 decision, the Board granted the cause of death claim pursuant to the PACT Act. In an October 2023 rating decision, with November 2023 notification letter, the AOJ assigned the effective date of cause of death as August 10, 2022, the effective date of the PACT Act. Here, given the long procedural history, the Veteran's initial DIC claim had not become final and was still pending final appellate review at the time of the passage of the PACT Act given the appellant's appeal to the Court. 

An initial DIC claim that was denied by the AOJ and appealed to the Board prior to August 10, 2022 qualifies as a request for reevaluation of a previously denied DIC claim under the PACT Act. As service connection for the Veteran's cause of death was awarded under the PACT Act in this case and the Appellant's original DIC claim was denied by the AOJ prior to August 10, 2022, and was pending before the Board, an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is permitted. 

The record reflects that the Appellant's claim would have been granted if the PACT Act had existed at the time of the original DIC claim. In this regard, the Veteran's death certificate documents that the immediate and only cause of death was pulmonary fibrosis. The Veteran's personnel records show that he served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from April 1997 to October 1997. Thus, the criteria for service connection for the Veteran's cause of death pursuant to the PACT Act were met at the time of the Appellant's original DIC claim.

The record does not reflect that an informal or formal service connection claim was received prior to October 29, 2014. As the Veteran's original DIC claim was received on October 29, 2014, and such claim was received within a year of the Veteran's death in August 2014, an effective date for the first of the month in which the Veteran died is warranted, specifically August 1, 2014. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).

Based on the foregoing, the effective date of August 1, 2014, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's cause of death is warranted. As such, the Appellant's claim is granted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.33, 3.400, 4.16. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
