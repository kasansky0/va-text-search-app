ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for nocturia is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

A disability manifested by nocturia is not currently manifest and did not manifest at any point during the appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for nocturia are not met.? 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.?

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from January 2016 to January 2020.? 

With respect to the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for nocturia, in a February 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for this disability.? In March 2024, the Veteran requested Higher-Level Review (HLR) as to the denial.? The HLR rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024.? With a request for HLR, the evidentiary record is limited to that of record at the time of the decision for which HLR is requested; here, February 2024.? 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.? As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue on appeal.? See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301.? The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182).? 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.? The Veteran has not filed such a request.

Service connection for nocturia

The Veteran contends that he has nocturia that is related to service.  ? 

Veterans are entitled to compensation from VA if they develop a disability "resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty."? 38?U.S.C. §?1110 (wartime service), 1131 (peacetime service).? To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service"-the so-called "nexus" requirement.? Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).? 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report of functional impairment resulting in a disability manifested by nocturia.? However, the post-service objective evidence of record establishes that the Veteran does not currently have a disability manifested by nocturia.  ? 

In this regard, the Veteran was provided VA urinary tract conditions examination in November 2023.  After examination of the Veteran and consideration of his medical history as well as the Veteran's report that he must urinate 3-4 times in the night, the VA examiner declined to diagnose the Veteran with a disability manifested by nocturia.? Pertinently, the examination showed normal findings as to the urinary tract.? The Board finds this examination to be of great probative value as the examination was based on thorough examination of the Veteran.? Moreover, the remainder of the objective evidence of record does not contradict these findings.  ? 

Accordingly, in this case, the Board finds that the most probative evidence weighs against a finding that the criteria have been met for current nocturia.? 

The Board has considered the Veteran's statements that he has a disability manifested by nocturia.? The Veteran is competent to provide evidence of that which he experiences, including his symptomatology and medical history.? Layno v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?465, 469 (1994).? In addition, lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when: (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or, (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.? Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007)); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?428, 433, n.4 (2011).? However, competence must be distinguished from probative weight.? Although the Veteran is competent to relate what he experiences through the senses, the lay evidence is lacking in detail to support the conclusion that there is a disability manifested by nocturia.? The Veteran's lay assertions are therefore afforded less probative weight, and less credibility than the VA examination report.? 

In this instance, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have nocturia.? The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability benefits.? See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1997).? Therefore, in the absence of current disability, there can be no valid claim.? See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225 (1992).? In this case, there is no disability that resulted from a disease or injury.? The Board emphasizes that under the provisions of 1110 and 1131, there must be disability and such disability must be due to disease or injury.? Although Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) addressed whether pain could be a disability, Saunders did not eliminate the requirement that there be underlying acquired pathology (disease or injury).? 

Under the circumstances, the Veteran has not met the regulatory requirements to establish service connection for nocturia under any theory of entitlement and service connection must be denied.? The evidence is against the claim and the benefit sought on appeal is therefore denied.
