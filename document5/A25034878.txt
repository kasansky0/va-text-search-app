ORDER

An effective date of September 18, 2019, and no earlier, is granted for the award of an increased rating to 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.   In an August 2010 rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for PTSD and assigned an initial disability rating of 30 precent, effective November 24, 2009.

2.  The Veteran was notified of the RO's August 2010 decision and of his appellate rights in September 2010; however, he did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision, nor was any new and material evidence received within one year of the August 2010 rating decision.

3.  In an August 2012 rating decision, a VARO awarded an increased rating to 50 percent, but no higher, for PTSD, effective May 11, 2012.

4.  The Veteran was notified of the RO's August 2012 decision and of his appellate rights; however, he did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision, nor was any new and material evidence received within one year of the August 2012 rating decision.

5.  The Veteran filed an increased rating claim in July 2015, and in an October 2015 rating decision, the RO denied a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD.

6.  The Veteran was notified of the RO's October 2015 decision and of his appellate rights; however, he did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision, nor was any new and material evidence received within one year of the October 2015 rating decision.

7.  Following issuance of the October 2015 rating decision, no formal claim for compensation, or intent to file such a claim, was received until September 18, 2020, when the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits) for an increased rating for PTSD.

8.  It is factually ascertainable from the evidence available for review that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability increased in severity during the one-year period prior to his September 18, 2020 increased rating claim, so as to warrant the assignment of a higher, 70 percent rating for PTSD beginning September 18, 2019.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The August 2010 rating decision assigning an initial 30 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.1103.

2. The August 2012 rating decision assigning a 50 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.1103.

3.  The October 2015 rating decision denying a disability rating in excess of 50 percent rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD is final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 20.1103.

4. The criteria for the assignment of an effective date of September 18, 2019, and no earlier, for the award of an increased rating to 70 percent for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from October 1988 to July 1992.  His decorations include the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Southwest Asia Service Medal.

In a December 2020 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) increased the Veteran's disability rating for PTSD to 70 percent, effective September 18, 2020.  After having requested an extension due to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, he filed a request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) in April 2023.  In August 2023, the AOJ granted the Veteran's extension request and issued a HLR decision that awarded an earlier effective date of September 1, 2020, for the increased rating of 70 percent.  Thereafter, the Veteran timely appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request:  Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in November 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).  

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the September 2020 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify that evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date of September 18, 2019, for the assigment of an increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD is granted.

The Veteran seeks an effective date of 70 percent for PTSD from November 24, 2009, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).   See April 2023 representative statement ("It is clear in the record that VA did not consider the new and material evidence submitted in the appellate period for the August 31, 2010 rating decision because the next rating decision, dated August 24, 2012 failed to reference them in the analysis.  Although the new and material VAMC evidence was uploaded to the claims file on May 22, 2012, the August 24, 2012 rating decision focused only on a recent GAF of 53.  The new and material evidence, however, cited to a GAF of only 45.  Yet VA failed to consider the previous GAF that indicated more severe impairment in the appellate period for the August 31, 2010 rating decision.").

In the alternative, the Veteran seeks a 70 percent rating for PTSD back to May 11, 2012, the date that he previously filed a claim for increased rating.  Id. ("If VA finds that it did consider the VAMC records that were received by VA in the appellate period for the August 31, 2010 rating decision, then [the Veteran] argues in the alternative that he is entitled to a 70 percent rating for PTSD from May 11, 2012); see also November 2023 representative statement.  Specifically, the Veteran's representative presented argument alleging that new and material evidence consisting of VA treatment records from November 2012 and September 2013 were constructively received within one year of the subsequent August 2012 rating decision, rendering the evaluation of his PTSD nonfinal pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Id.  The representative further asserts that this evidence was likewise not considered in a subsequent October 2015 rating decision, and so it follows that the Veteran's increased rating claim should be considered to have been pending since May 2012.  Id.

In response to the arguments raised by the Veteran and his representative, the Board will first specifically address the challenge to the finality of the prior rating decisions.  The Board notes at the outset that the AOJ has not assessed whether records either received or generated by VA within one year of the August 2010, August 2012, or October 2015 rating decisions contained new and material evidence pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  However, legal precedent indicates that the Board can make that assessment in first instance.  See Lang v. Wilkie, 971 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (noting that a claim remains open until VA determines whether post-decision evidence received within the one-year appeal period is "new and material," and finding that the Court erred in not remanding the appeal "to the Board to review the post-decision VA[] medical records for new and material evidence"); see also Jackson v. Principi, 265 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Circ. 2001) (the Board has a jurisdictional responsibility to consider whether new and material evidence has been received regardless of how the AOJ ruled on the matter).  Therefore, although the AOJ has not directly addressed the VA treatment records that were generated within a year of the prior rating decisions for purposes of § 3.156(b), the Board will, at this juncture, assess in the first instance whether the records are "new" and "material" to the increased rating for PTSD adjudicated so as to render either rating decision non-final under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) (2010).  

In this regard, the Board notes that evidence is considered "new" if it was not previously submitted to agency decision makers.  "Material" evidence is existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.  "New and material evidence" can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record at the time of the last prior final denial of the claim sought to be reopened.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(a).

Turning first to the August 2010 rating decision, the Veteran was notified of the RO's August 2010 decision and of his appellate rights in September 2010.  However, he did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision.   

Here, the Veteran's representative has advanced argument to the effect that the August 2010 rating decision should be rendered nonfinal pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  See April 2023 argument submitted with VA Form 20-0996.  Specifically, it is argued that that VA treatment records generated by VA within the relevant one-year time period following that rating decision included VA treatment records demonstrating that the Veteran had a Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score of 45 prior to the date of the August 2010 rating decision.  Id.  The Board notes that the AOJ also provided the Veteran with a June 2011 VA general medical exanimation within one year of the August 2010 rating decision.  Additionally, a careful review of the record reveals that Vocational Rehabilitation and Education (VR&E) records, including an April 2011 application, subsequent vocational testing and handicap sheet, and a May 2011 suspension letter were also received/generated within the one-year period, but only added to the electronic claims file in February 2018.  The Board will assess all of this evidence in the context of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

Looking first at the VA treatment records and responding to the argument presented, the Board notes that the August 2010 rating decision expressly states that evidence considered included VA treatment records for the time periods "from June 15, 2005 through July 29, 2010" and "from July 20, 2010 through August 20, 2010," which would encompass March and July 2010 VA treatment records that already documented a GAF score of 45.  Even though the rating decision focused on the GAF of 52 that was assigned in the July 2010 VA PTSD examination, instead mentioning any lower scores documented in the identified VA treatment records, that fact is not dispositive of whether the relevant treatment records demonstrating a GAF of 45 were or were not before adjudicators at the time of the August 2010 rating decision.  Rather, because the RO expressly listed VA treatment records in the evidence section of the August 2010 rating decision, the Board finds that the GAF scores of 45 found in March and July 2010 VA treatment records were before agency decisionmakers at that time.  It therefore follows that any additional GAF scores of 45 found within VA-generated treatment records generated within the one-year time period following the August 2010 rating decision, such as those noted in February and March 2011 VA treatment reports and uploaded to the electronic claims file in May 2012, cannot be considered "new" and "material" because they are cumulative and redundant of evidence already of record at the time of August 2010 rating decision that assigned an initial rating of 30 percent, and no higher, for the Veteran's PTSD.  

Nor do the treatment records generated by VA within one year of the August 2010 rating decision otherwise contain new and material evidence suggestive of a higher rating warranted for the time period adjudicated in that initial rating decision; rather, the RO had before it evidence in which the Veteran reported similar symptoms to those denoted in the post-rating-decision records that were later associated with the file.  See, generally, August 2009, September 2009, October 2009, March 2010, April 2010, and July 2010 VA treatment reports (demonstrating a wide variety of psychiatric symptoms, including but not limited to guilt, anxiety, insomnia, trouble sleeping, nightmares, depression, labile and anxious affect, intrusive thoughts, irritability, and hypervigilance); see also July 2010 VA examination report.  

Turning next to the June 2011 VA general medical examination, the Board notes that that document cites a history of anxiety and panic attacks.  However, the Board finds that this is likewise cumulative and redundant of evidence already of record at the time of the August 2010 rating decision.  For example, a September 2009 VA treatment record that was of record at the time of the prior rating decision noted that the Veteran "states his anxiety gets bad to the point he bites his fingernails and his B[lood] P[ressure] has increased since."  He "[a]lso reports getting 'shaky[,]' S[hort O[f] B[reath][,] chest pain [and] these episodes happen for 15 minutes and has been occurring couple times a month or it can be unexpected."  September 2009 VA treatment record.  Additionally, he had also previously reported that he had been "getting attacks which are vivid in his mind.  States the slightest sound or trigger can get him in that mode of anxiety."  Id.; see also July 2010 VA examination report (noting that he "complains of being nervous and having ongoing anxiety feelings which at times feel overwhelming" and "wakes up from dreams often in a panic.").  Thus, the evidence of anxiety and panic attacks found within the June 2011 VA general medical examination is redundant of evidence previously considered in the rating decision and is not both new and material.

With respect to the VR&E records, the Veteran's May 2011 handicap sheet referenced impairments of "anger issues, irritability," which likewise are symptoms that were already documented in records before adjudicators at the time of the August 2010 rating decision.  See, e.g., August 2009 VA treatment record ("reports irritability [and] fits of rage" and "[h]as key symptoms (pessimism/hopelessness, worthlessness, anger, or anxious/agitated)").  Additionally, although the Veteran underwent vocational and personality testing, the results generally align with symptoms previously reported in VA treatment records and his July 2010 VA examination that were considered in the August 2010 rating decision.  See July 2010 VA examination report (documenting symptoms, including but not limited to, nervousness, anger or irritability, rage, depression, arguments and verbal confrontations, problems with sleep, stressor dreams, waking from dreams in a panic, thoughts and memories of the incident, avoidance, being "not as social as he was before the incident," not being close with family, wanting to be left alone, "mood is down," intrusive thoughts, a history of physical confrontations, impulse control problems, "restricted range of affect," and "increased arousal symptoms").  The Board therefore finds that the VR&E records received/generated within one year are not new and material evidence of more severe PTSD symptomatology dating back to the time period adjudicated by the prior August 2010 rating decision so as to disturb the finality of the initially assigned 30 percent rating.  

For the reasons discussed above, the Board has reviewed the records within one year of the August 2010 rating decision and determines that the evidence is not new and material as to the initial rating assigned for the time period covered (i.e., prior to the date of the rating decision, so as to render that decision non-final under the tenets of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  Although additional VA records were generated within one year of the August 2010 rating decision, including but not limited to some treatment records that note a GAF score of 45, as argued by the Veteran's representative, this evidence is cumulative and redundant of evidence previously considered and also does not specifically date back to the initial rating period addressed by the August 2010 rating decision.  Thus, it cannot be said that those records are new and material to the August 2010 rating decision's assignment of an initial rating of 30 percent, and no higher, for the Veteran's PTSD.  Thus, finality attaches to the August 2010 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) (2010).

Turning to the August 2012 rating decision, the RO awarded a 50 percent rating for PTSD, effective May 11, 2012.  The Veteran was notified of the RO's August 2012 decision and of his appellate rights; however, he likewise did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision.   

In addressing whether there was any new and material evidence received within one year of the August 2012 rating decision so as to render it nonfinal under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b), the Board acknowledges that VA treatment records were also created and in VA's constructive possession within one year of the August 2012 rating decision.  These include the November 2012 and September 2013 VA treatment records specifically identified by the Veteran's representative in the November 2023 brief.  See November 2023 representative argument.  The November 2012 VA treatment record was added to the record in September 2020, but it does not appear that a copy of the September 2013 VA treatment record was added to the electronic record until submitted by the representative in November 2023.  Regardless, this document was referenced in other VA treatment records (see January 2014 VA treatment records (noting that the Veteran reported an increase in symptoms in September 2013 after he ran out of his medication)), and the Board may consider it in VA's possession during the allowable evidentiary window pertaining to the current appeal.  See Euzebio v. McDonough, 989 F.3d 1305, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (for evidence to be constructively of record, it needs to be within the VA Secretary's control and "relevant and reasonably connected to the appellant's claim").  Additionally, a careful review of the record reveals that some additional VR&E records, including a December 2012 application, a subsequent Counseling Record, and January 2013 denial letter were also received/generated within the one-year period but only added to the electronic claims file in February 2018.  The Board will assess all of this evidence in the context of 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

In the May 2012 rating decision, the RO at that time explained that the "overall evidentiary record [which included a May 2012 VA examination report and VA treatment records from June 2005 through May 2012] shows that the severity of your disability most closely approximates the criteria for a 50 percent disability evaluation."  See May 2012 rating decision.  

Turning to the VA-generated records from November 2012 and September 2013, the Veteran's representative asserts:

On November 21, 2012 [he] was examined by a VA psychiatrist who noted that [he] had a restricted affect and only "fair," thus "impaired," impulse control.  The psychiatrist documented [he] was having "partic" nightmares, ongoing intrusive war memories of incidents aboard ship with the explosion, people burning.[]  The psychiatrist noted that [his] GAF was only 45. [] 

On September 24, 2013, [he] was seen by a VA social worker [who] noted that [he], while making advances in PTSD treatment recently, had begun to worsen. The social worker noted a depressed and anxious mood with a congruent affect. [] 

The VAMC records documenting psychiatric treatment in the appellate period for the August 21, 2012 rating decision comprise new and material evidence that is deemed to have been received by VA adjudicators, which serves to have kept the May 11, 2012 claim for increased rating pending through the present [citation omitted]."

See November 2023 representative statement.   

The symptoms reported, however, in the November 2012 and September 2013 VA treatment records are duplicative of symptoms previously reported in VA treatment records that were before adjudicators at the time of the August 2012 rating decision.  These include March 2011 VA treatment reports, noting the Veteran's "particularly disruptive dream" as well as "disabling anxiety," "trouble in getting along with others at work," and a notation that the Veteran was continuing to "not socialize and has panic conditions on a multiple time per day basis."  Similarly, "fair" impulse control was also shown in the March 2011 VA treatment report, as well as a GAF score of 45.  See also February 2011 VA treatment report (also noting symptoms including, but not limited to, irritability, poor sleep with nightmares, waking in a state of panic, sudden anxiety attacks, nearly panic attack, crying easily, trouble concentrating, avoidance of crowds, and negative intrusive thoughts).  Comparing the symptoms noted in the November 2012 and September 2013 VA treatment records generated within one year of the August 2012 rating decision, the Board finds that they are in line with previously reported symptoms.  Thus, they are not new and material to the rating assigned for PTSD in the August 2012 rating decision.

Moreover, with regard to the September 2013 VA treatment record in particular, the Board acknowledges that a January 2014 VA treatment record stated that "[the] Veteran reports [an increase in] s[ymptom]s after he ran out of fluoxetine 9/2013."  However, the January 2014 VA treatment records is beyond the one-year period following the August 2012 rating decision.  Turning to the actual September 2013 VA treatment record constructively received within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran had reported he was "now" experiencing some irritability but there had also been an improvement in his isolation.  See September 2013 VA treatment record ("He is less isolated and more disclosing to others . . . [and] has attempted more often to 'date' his wife and to attend to her needs & desires.").  To the extent that he reported irritability, the Board notes that he previously endorsed symptoms of irritably in prior VA treatment records that were before adjudicators in August 2012.  See, e.g., October 2011 VA treatment record (noting a response of "4," corresponding to "Quite a bit," in response to whether the Veteran is "feeling irritable or having angry outbursts"); see also August 2009, October 2009, and March 2010 VA treatment records; August 2010 rating decision (conceding that the Veteran suffered from symptoms, to include "regular anger and irritability that can turn to rage and then depression" in the assignment of an initial 30 percent rating for PTSD).  To the extent that the social worker reported a depressed and anxious mood with congruent affect in September 2013 as pointed out by the Veteran's representative, this was likewise consistent with his prior history of anxiety and depression previously reported by the Veteran in VA treatment records that were of record at the time of the August 2012 rating decision.  See, e.g., April 2012 VA treatment record (assessing a primary diagnosis of PTSD and a secondary diagnosis of depression); March 2011 VA treatment record (noting "he continues to have disabling anxiety" and that his mood was "depressed").

Next, the Board finds that the Veteran's December 2012 VR&E application and VA-generated records through January 2013 are not new and material to his PTSD rating that was adjudicated in the August 2012 rating decision.  The Board notes that the January 2013 Counseling Record and Narrative Report referenced symptoms of him being agitated and avoiding people, but these were symptoms previously noted in VA treatment records that were already before the August 2012 adjudicators.  See, e.g., October 2011 VA treatment record (in addition to discussing irritability, the Veteran reported a response of "5," corresponding to "extremely," to "feeling distant or cut off from other people" and "feeling emotionally numb or being unable to have loving feelings for those close to you").  Moreover, the VR&E records indicated that the Veteran was working and that his service-connected disabilities "do not impair his ability to prepare for, obtain and maintain employment."  See January 2013 Counseling Record and Narrative Report.  Accordingly, the VA Counselor determined that the Veteran did "not meet the criteria for an employment handicap due to having overcome the impairments to employability as []he is currently employed."  Id.  As such, in a January 2013 letter, VA denied his application.  Thus, the VR&E records do not contain new and material evidence going towards a higher rating for PTSD.

Moreover, neither the identified VA treatment records nor VR&E records sufficiently date back to the time period covered by the August 2012 rating decision so as to be material to the 50 percent rating assigned for PTSD in that decision.  Thus, even though some later treatment records outside the one-year period cited a worsening of symptoms that the Veteran reported to have occurred in September 2013, the evidence received or generated within the one year period nonetheless fails to constitute new and material evidence going toward August 2012 rating decision's assignment of a 50 percent rating, and no higher, for the Veteran's PTSD for the time period at issue, i.e., prior to the date of the August 2012 rating decision.  

In light of the foregoing, although additional VA treatment records and VR&E records were generated within one year of the August 2012 rating decision, including the November 2012 and September 2013 VA treatment records specifically identified by the Veteran's representative, the records are not new and material to the August 2012 rating decision's denial of a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD.  Thus, finality attaches to the August 2012 rating decision, as well.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

Having found the August 2010 and August 2012 rating decisions are final, the Board notes that the RO later adjudicated the Veteran's PTSD rating in an October 2015 rating decision.  In that rating decision, the AOJ determined that a disability rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD was not warranted.  See October 2015 rating decision ("The overall evidentiary record shows that the severity of your disability most closely approximates the criteria for a 50 percent disability evaluation").  The Veteran was notified of the RO's October 2015 decision and of his appellate rights, but he did not initiate an appeal during the one-year period following the mailing of notice of that decision.

Although not specifically argued by the Veteran or his representative, the Board notes that there are VA treatment records that were generated by VA within one-year of the October 2015 rating decision that appear to be added to the electronic claims file in September 2020.  Accordingly, the Board will consider whether any of those records from one-year of the October 2015 rating decision constitute new and material evidence under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).  

Upon a review of the VA-generated records during the pertinent time period, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran sought psychiatric treatment for his PTSD in February and August 2016.  His reported that symptoms included nightmares, irritability, anger, depression, occasional crying, anxiety, and ongoing intrusive and war memories.  See February 2016 VA treatment report.  He also reported issues with crowds and going to public places, flashbacks, dysthymic and constricted affect, and insomnia.  See August 2016 VA treatment report.  However, the Board finds that these symptoms are duplicative of symptomatology reported in his September 2015 VA PTSD examination report, which was considered by adjudicators in the October 2015 rating decision.  See September 2015 VA PTSD examination report (documenting symptoms of "irritability and moods," difficulty in dealing with others at work, recurrent memories, distressing dreams, avoidance symptoms, persistence emotional state, markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, feelings of detachment or estrangement from others, irritable behavior and angry outbursts, hypervigilance, problems with concentration, sleep disturbance, anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective relationships, difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances).  What is more, the February 2016 and August 2016 VA treatment reports do not indicate that any of the reported symptoms may have dated back to the rating period addressed by the October 2015 rating decision.  

In light of the above, the Board finds that, although additional VA treatment records were generated within one year of the October 2015 rating decision, the records are not new and material to the October 2015 rating decision's denial of a rating in excess of 50 percent for PTSD.  Thus, finality attaches to the October 2015 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b).

Following issuance of the October 2015 rating decision, no formal claim for compensation, or intent to file such a claim, was received until September 18, 2020, when the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits) for an increased rating for PTSD.

Generally, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).  The effective date "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

An exception to that rule applies only under circumstances where the evidence demonstrates that a factually ascertainable increase in disability occurred during the one-year period preceding the date of receipt of the claim for increased compensation.  If an increase in disability occurred within one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective as of the date the increase was "factually ascertainable."  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).  If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the claim, the increase is effective the date of receipt of the claim.  If the increase occurred after the date of receipt of the claim, the effective date is the date of increase.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2).

Historically, effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  That rulemaking also eliminated the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims for increase and revised 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Under the former regulations governing informal claims, any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant or his representative, could be considered an informal claim.  Such informal claim had to identify the benefit sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim had not been filed, an application form was to be forwarded to the claimant for execution.  If received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it would be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim.  When a claim had been filed which met the requirements of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151 or 3.152, an informal request for increase or reopening would be accepted as a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2014).

After carefully reviewing the evidence, the Board finds that the September 18, 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ is the first communication that can be interpreted as a claim for an increase following the last final October 2015 rating decision.  No communication was received between the date of mailing of notice of the final October 2015 rating decision and December 9, 2022, that constitutes an intent to file a claim or formal claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's psychiatric disability.

Therefore, as noted, the question for the Board is whether it is factually ascertainable that the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric disability increased in severity during the one-year period prior to September 18, 2020, so as to warrant the assignment of a higher rating for all or any portion of that one-year period.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  If the increase occurred more than a year prior to the receipt of the claim, the effective date shall be the date of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (explaining that the purpose of the effective date provisions for increased rating claims, previously codified at 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2), was to provide veterans with a one-year "grace period" for filing a claim following an increase in a service-connected disability).

In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran submitted a September 2020 private psychiatric evaluation.  The Board has carefully reviewed this report to ascertain whether it suggests that a factually ascertainable worsening of the Veteran's symptoms became manifest within the one-year period preceding his September 18, 2020 claim.   Notably, the private psychologist stated that "[i]n recent months, he reported a resurgence of suicidal ideation, uncontrolled anger and crying, isolation, panic attacks, and nightmares, more severe than in his past."  See September 2020 psychiatric evaluation.  It was also reported that, "[i]n recent months he reported an increased frequency of disturbing nightmares and momentary disorientation and panic upon awakening (Disorientation to Time and Place)."  Id.  In that regard, there appears to be no question that the Veteran's PTSD underwent an increase in severity during the one-year period from September 18, 2020, to December 8, 2022.  Although the private psychologist did offer a specific number of months over which these symptoms increased in severity, the Board broadly interprets the phrase "recent months" to mean some period of time that is less than one year prior to the date of the private examination, which was conducted on September 1, 2020. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board resolves doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that an effective date for the award of increased compensation for his service-connected psychiatric disability is warranted as of September 18, 2019.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  This is the earliest date authorized by statute for when there was a factually ascertainable onset of symptomatology warranting an increased rating during the one-year period prior to September 18, 2020.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  The appeal is granted to that extent.
