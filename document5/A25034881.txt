ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1970 to June 1973. 

The Veteran appeared at a March 2025 hearing before the undersigned Veteran Law Judge.  The hearing transcript is of record. 

In April 2021, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In March 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Hearing docket.   Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

Service Connection for Tinnitus 

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was initially manifested during active service.

Service connection may be granted for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears.  The service personnel records reflect that the Veteran served with the Army as a linesman.  

The report of a March 2021 audiological examination conducted for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) states that the Veteran reported that tinnitus was initially manifested during active service.  The VA examiner conceded the Veteran's in service noise exposure. The Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.  

At the March 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that he had been exposed to gunfire and simulated grenade explosion related noise while he was training with an infantry unit after his period of basic training.  He stated that he initially experienced tinnitus in 1972 during service and the disability had persisted to the present time.  

The Board finds that the evidence is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed tinnitus arose during active service.  The Veteran reported initially experiencing recurrent tinnitus in 1972 during active service which has persisted to the present time.  A VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with tinnitus.  The Veteran is competent to report ringing in his ears and having tinnitus present since service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (a)(2); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
