REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating, beginning February 24, 2023, for adjustment disorder with anxiety is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1962 to May 1963.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In December 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. See December 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). 

Although the period to change dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, the Veteran, through his representative, explicitly waived the Williams period and requested that a decision be expedited on the claim. See January 2025 Waiver. As such, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding with adjudication of the appeal.

Entitlement to a compensable rating, beginning February 24, 2023, for adjustment disorder with anxiety.

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date of February 24, 2023, for the award of a 50 percent disability evaluation for adjustment disorder with anxiety (hereinafter "adjustment disorder"). See December 2024 VA Form 10182. In the alternative, the Veteran is seeking an initial rating of 30 percent until the current effective date of August 1, 2024, for the award of the 50 percent rating. Id. 

The Veteran asserts the medical evidence of record, in conjunction with his own statements, support a rating of 50 percent dating back to the filing date of the initial claim. See August 2024 VA Form 20-0996.

Under the provisions of the AMA, the Board must remand a claim to correct a duty to assist error made by the AOJ if that error occurred prior to the issuance of the rating decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide an adequate examination. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for hearing loss and tinnitus in April 2023. He reported that his hearing loss causes him to feel anger and frustration. The Veteran indicated his hearing loss severely affects daily activities. His tinnitus negatively impacts concentration, focus, sleep, anxiety, and depression. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for mental disorders in May 2023. The examiner opined that the Veteran's adjustment disorder has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough either to interfere with occupational and social functioning or to require continuous medication. However, the examiner did not address the Veteran's statements made during the April 2023 examination regarding the impact of hearing loss on his mental health. Accordingly, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error during the higher-level review process and returned the claim to obtain an adequate examination. See September 2023 Rating Decision. 

A subsequent VA examination and addendum opinion were completed in August 2024. While the examiner did provide an opinion as to the conflicting evidence, neither the examination nor addendum opinion discussed the June 2023 private treatment records submitted in September 2023. See June 2023 Private Treatment Records. 

During a June 2023 primary care appointment, the Veteran reported feeling bothered quite a bit in the previous four weeks due to emotional problems including feeling anxious or depressed. His physical and emotional health have limited social activities with family, friends, neighbors, and groups quite a bit during this time frame. The Veteran stated that his anxiety stems from an injury in the military and while intermittent, "it can get pretty rough at times." He has been prescribed clonazepam since at least July 2022. 

While this evidence was submitted after notice of the May 2023 rating decision granting service connection, it became part of the evidentiary record following the higher-level review return in September 2023. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). A claim is considered pending for readjudication after identification of a duty to assist error during a higher-level review. This event reopens the record and "any evidence previously submitted to the [AOJ] or associated with the claims file while the record was closed will become part of the evidentiary record to be considered upon readjudication." Id. 

Here, the June 2023 treatment notes became part of the record following the higher-level review return in September 2023. As such, this evidence was available for consideration at the time of the August 2024 examination. The Board finds this evidence to be highly relevant as it discusses the severity of the Veteran's anxiety and identifies medication potentially utilized for its treatment. The Board, therefore, finds that the August 2024 VA examination and opinion are inadequate, as the examiner failed to consider all relevant medical evidence of record. Barr, supra.; see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008).

Accordingly, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error and obtain an adequate medical opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's adjustment disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from a qualified medical professional addressing the severity of the Veteran's adjustment disorder with anxiety. After a complete review of the claims file, to include a copy of this Remand, the examiner should provide a full description of the disability from February 24, 2023 (the date of service connection) to the present.

If the examiner concludes a medical examination is necessary, such an examination should be scheduled. 

The examiner should consider all lay statements, medical evidence, and other medical opinions of record. 

The examiner's attention is drawn to June 2023 private treatment records addressing the Veteran's mental health symptoms and medication.

If the examiner is unable to provide the above-requested opinion without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why this is so (e.g. lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.). The examiner must provide a thorough rationale for each opinion given.
