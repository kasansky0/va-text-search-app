ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1975 to January 1978.

A July 2023 Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss. That decision contained a discussion of the history of this appeal. Following the July 2023 denial, the Veteran appealed this matter to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). In October 2023, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), which vacated the section of the Board's July 2023 decision which denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss and remanded the matter to the Board for further proceedings consistent with the JMPR.

The Veteran testified at a hearing before a Veterans Law Judge in March 2023. This decision reflects the Board's consideration of the testimony, evidence, and information presented in that hearing, and a transcript of the hearing is in the claims file. As an appeal in which the appellant requested a Board hearing, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issues on appeal, evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative at the hearing, to include testimony provided at the hearing, and evidence submitted by the appellant or his representative within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), service connection may be granted for disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. Such permits a grant of service connection not only for disability caused by a service-connected disability, but for the degree of disability resulting from aggravation to a nonservice-connected disability by a service-connected disability. Id. See also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b). 

In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).

Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran already has a confirmed diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss as noted by the March 2018 VA examination as well as exposure to hazardous noise in service. Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection have been met. Accordingly, the only issue before the Board is evidence establishing a connection between the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss and his time in service. 

The Veteran contends that his bilateral hearing loss was caused by his time in service. The Veteran specifically pointed to a rocket exploded in front of him during service. In his December 2017 statement in support of his claim, the Veteran described in great detail his exposure to loud noises during his time in service. This included weapons fire to include grenades and cannons. He also stated he was often around armored vehicles and that despite these numerous exposures he did not have hearing protection. 

A December 2017 buddy statement stated that the Veteran did not have hearing loss when he left for service but that he suffered from hearing loss upon his return. This was submitted by a person who knew the Veteran his whole life so would have a baseline understanding of the Veteran's hearing prior to his entrance into service. 

At his March 2023 hearing, the Veteran testified that there was a change in decibel readings from entrance to separation. He testified to having to turn the television up and that at restaurants he could not understand and hear what was going on. The Veteran stated that he noticed a difference in his earing between entrance and exit from service. He testified to being a truck driver in service which meant he was around loud trucks and airplanes. The Veteran further noted that upon his exit from service he went to a VA in Chattanooga to be treated for bilateral hearing loss but they advised him that there was nothing they could do and so he left. 

Sensorineural hearing loss is a condition that is considered chronic, and therefore, will be presumed to have been incurred in service if it manifested to a compensable degree (meaning to at least 10 percent disabling) within one year after discharge from service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 264, 271 (2015) (specifying that sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus are considered organic diseases of the nervous system subject to § 3.309(a)). This presumption, however, is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), where a chronic disease such as sensorineural hearing loss is shown as such in service, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease are generally service connected. If a chronic disease is noted in service but chronicity in service is not adequately supported, a showing of continuity of symptomatology after separation is required. Entitlement to service connection based on chronicity or continuity of symptomatology pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) applies only when the disability for which a veteran is claiming compensation is due to a disease enumerated on the list of chronic diseases in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(3) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

For purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater, or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater, or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Also, the threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The absence of evidence of a hearing disability during service (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385) is not always fatal to a claim for service connection of hearing loss.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). Rather, service connection of hearing loss may be granted where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting the regulatory requirements for hearing loss disability for VA purposes, and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service, as opposed to intercurrent causes. Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 159.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows audiograms in January 1975 and November 1977. The Board notes that the highest shift from one reading to another during this time period was a 10 decibel shift in the right ear at the 2000 hertz level. The Veteran discussed this shift in the February 2025 statement submitted in support of his claim. While the March 2018 VA examiner concluded that there was no significant threshold shift, the Veteran points to a Department of Defense (DOD) document defining a significant threshold shift as an average change of 10 decibels at 2000, 3000, and 4000 relative to the reference audiogram. While the Board is not bound by this finding it is certainly relevant information in the Veteran's appeal. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his bilateral hearing loss in March 2018. This examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The Veteran noted that he has difficulty understanding speech if there is background noise or if he is in a crowd. The examiner noted a review of the Veteran's in-service audiograms. The examiner concluded that neither the right nor left ear hearing loss was related to the Veteran's time in service. The examiner did note that the Veteran did not suffer a significant threshold shift from entrance to exit. The Veteran's representative argued that this was not enough of a discussion of this shift, but the Board disagrees and notes that the examiner provided additional rationale. The Veteran's hearing was found to be normal at separation.

The Board finds that the lay evidence from both the Veteran and others, along with the submission of the DOD document showing a different definition of a significant threshold shift, to be enough to justify that the Veteran was suffering from bilateral hearing loss upon his exit from service. Specifically, the Veteran has stated that his hearing loss began upon his return from service. He has submitted a December 2017 lay statement confirming that he began to complain of and have hearing issues upon his return from service. Further, at his March 2023 hearing, the veteran testified to seeking treatment shortly after leaving service where he was turned away because there was nothing, they could do for him. It appears based on this testimony that the Veteran did not seek treatment in the future as a result of this initial poor service at a VA medical center. Therefore, providing all benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds that the Veteran's time in service, and specifically exposure to weapons fire and loud vehicles, has resulted in damaged hearing which has subsequently been diagnosed as bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Accordingly, providing all benefit of the doubt to the Veteran, this significant threshold shift, along with his testimony of seeking treatment immediately after service, and lay statements regarding bilateral hearing loss immediately upon exit from service is enough to show a continuity of symptomology and therefore, the third element of service connection has been met and the claim for service connection is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc).
