ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's gastroesophageal reflux disease, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence shows that the Veteran's GERD symptoms show a combination of symptoms productive of considerable impairment of health.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an increased rating to 30 percent for the Veteran's service-connected GERD disability rating have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.114, Diagnostic Code 7346.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from August 1989, until April 1992.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an April 2023, rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior April 2023, rating decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023, rating decision.

In the October 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023, agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service.  The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41.  Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991).  Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider the Veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending.  Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous."  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time.  Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings).

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the evidence is not in approximate balance and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is granted.

The Veteran is seeking a higher rating due to the ameliorative effects of his medications that provide relief and are not considered by the rating criteria.

The Veteran's GERD is rated by analogy to 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7346, for hiatal hernia. Pursuant to DC 7346, a 10 percent disability rating is warranted for two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity. A 30 percent evaluation is warranted for persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health. A maximum 60 percent evaluation is warranted for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health. 

For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the evidence, when viewed most favorable to the Veteran, shows that the GERD disability manifested in persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health.

The Veteran has provided argument regarding the failure of the AOJ to consider the effects of the Veteran's medication. In support of this the Veteran's lay statement from January 2023, noted that when he is not taking medication, he experiences persistent heartburn, regurgitation, and difficulty swallowing. Additionally, the Veteran explained that when eating the food will not go down, stating that it is like there is an air bubbles in the throat and that he experiences pain.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in February 2023, wherein the examiner noted that the Veteran's GERD manifested with symptoms of reflux, regurgitation, and sleep disturbances of four or more time per year. The examiner noted that the Veteran takes medication daily for his GERD and that this improved the Veteran's symptomology.

The AOJ, in its rating decision, did not take into account the Veteran's lay statement regarding his symptomology when not taking the medication. The rating provided to the Veteran is only based on the Veteran's disability symptomology when on medication, without considering the statements that directly relate to the symptoms used for rating the disability. This is consequential, as the Veteran's lay statements go directly towards the rating criteria in this matter. Specifically, the Veteran attests that he experiences pain and has difficulty swallowing his food without medication, which is clearly productive of considerable impairment of health. However, based on the evidence of record the Board is without evidence to support a more severe symptomology. Furthermore, there has been no evidence to support vomiting or material weight loss that would be associated with a more severe impairment of health.

In adjudicating this appeal, the Board is aware that the relevant rating criteria do not contemplate the effects of medication, and there is a duty to discount the ameliorative effects of medication when evaluating the Veteran's condition.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether or not discussed in detail. See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). Based on the discussion above, the Board finds that the evidence is in approximate balance, and the Veteran is afforded the benefit of the doubt. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

Accordingly, the Veteran's GERD manifested in persistently recurring epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, productive of considerable impairment of health throughout the appeal period, corresponding to the criteria for a 30 percent rating under DC 7346.

A higher 60 percent rating under DC 7346 is not warranted unless there are symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.

Thus, the Veteran's appeal for an increased rating for his service-connected GERD to a disability rating of 30 percent, but no higher, is granted.
