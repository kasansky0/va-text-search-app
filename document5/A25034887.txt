DOCKET NO. 240401-461925
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

An effective date prior to February 23, 2023, for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death (COD) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran passed away in April 2014 at the age of 66.

2. The Appellant's Intent to File was received by VA on February 23, 2023, and her claim of service connection for the Veteran's COD was received on March 2, 2023, and July 26, 2023; the record contains no communication prior to February 23, 2023, that may reasonably be construed as a formal or informal claim of service connection for the Veteran's COD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to February 23, 2023, for the award of service connection for the Veteran's COD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5110, 5103(a), 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.2, 20.202, 20.301, 3.102, 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 3.400 (2024).    

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from May 1967 to March 1970.  He passed away in April 2014; the Appellant is his surviving spouse.  This appeal stems from an August 2023 rating decision in which the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to service connection for COD and assigned an effective date of February 23, 2023- the date on which VA received the Appellant's Intent to File.

Subsequently, she appealed to the Board via an April 2024 Form 10182 in accordance with the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  She asserted that an earlier effective date was warranted for her benefits for the Veteran's COD.  In so doing, she requested that her claim be evaluated on the Direct Review Docket; therefore, the Board has considered her claim on the basis of the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.301.  

Turning to the relevant laws and regulations, VA death benefits are payable to the surviving spouse of a veteran if the veteran died from a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1310; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.5, 3.312.  In order to establish service connection for the cause of a veteran's death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by service either caused or contributed substantially or materially to the cause of death.

The Appellant has argued that an earlier effective date is warranted for her receipt of benefits for the Veteran's COD.  Generally, when determining an effective date, VA considers the date of receipt of the claim and the date entitlement arose and assigns an effective date for the later of the two dates.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  However, the effective date for a claim of service connection for a veteran's COD is assessed differently.  

Specifically, the effective date for such a claim is either the first day of the month in which the veteran's death occurred, if the claim is received within one year of the date of death, or the date of receipt of the claim, rather than the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(c)(2).  

Here, the Veteran passed away on April 28, 2014.  VA received the Appellant's Intent to File on February 23, 2023, and claims of service connection for the Veteran's COD on March 2, 2023, and July 26, 2023.  The August 2023 rating decision on appeal reflects an effective date of February 23, 2023- the date on which VA received the Appellant's Intent to File- for the award of service connection for the Veteran's COD.  In addition, the record reveals no other prior communication that may be reasonably construed as a formal or informal claim of service connection for the Veteran's COD until the February 23, 2023, Intent to File.  Therefore, February 23, 2023, is the date of receipt of the claim.

In April 2024 and March 2025, the Appellant reported that within a year of the Veteran's death, she received Social Security survivor's income from the Social Security Administration (SSA).  She argued that she submitted a claim for Social Security survivor's benefits at this time, and that her application to the SSA should be considered as an application for service connection for COD for VA benefits purposes.  See generally 38 U.S.C. § 5105(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.153.  See also Van Valkenburg v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 113, 119 (2009) (noting that "any claim sufficient to reflect an intent to apply for survivor's benefits that is filed with SSA will suffice to establish the effective date for DIC").  As such, she asserted that an earlier effective date for her award of service connection for the Veteran's COD was warranted.

The Appellant requested that the Board remand her claim for further development, to include obtaining records from the SSA.  However, her theory of entitlement was first raised after the issuance of the August 2023 rating decision on appeal and the Board is not permitted to remand to address theories of entitlement first raised in post-decisional argument or evidence.  Instead, the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence that was of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.

The Board has considered whether the evidence at the time of the August 2023 rating decision reflected receipt of SSA benefits by either the Appellant or the Veteran.  However, the Appellant indicated in her March 2023 and July 2023 claims that she did not received income from social security benefits and the records in the claims file at the time of the rating decision on appeal do not otherwise demonstrate that the Appellant received or applied for such benefits.  Therefore, the Appellant's post-decisional theory cannot serve as the basis for a remand based on a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

If the Appellant wishes to have her theory considered, she may file an additional Supplemental Claim and submit or identify any supporting evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue an additional decision on the claim, considering the new evidence along with the evidence previously considered.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As noted above, where a claim of service connection for the cause of a veteran's death is received more than one year after the date of the veteran's death, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim.  The Appellant's Intent to File was received in 2023- almost 9 years after the date of the Veteran's death.  Therefore, the law is controlling and an effective date prior to February 23, 2023, is not warranted.  As such, based on the above, the appeal is denied.

Finally, the Appellant has not raised any other outstanding issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record for the Board's consideration.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
