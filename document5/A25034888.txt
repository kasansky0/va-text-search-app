ORDER

The appeal of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed the VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, there was already a pending request for administrative review of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder, initiated by the May 2021 Higher-Level Review request.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from May 1981 to May 1986.  

Procedurally, an April 2021 rating decision, in pertinent part, denied service connection for a low back disorder.  See April 2021 Rating Decision; May 2021 VA Notification Letter (notifying the Veteran of the April 2021 decision and his appellate rights).  

The following month, the Veteran requested Higher Level Review of this decision, and in July 2021, a higher-level reviewer at the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) identified a duty to assist error in the development of the claim for service connection for a low back disorder and placed the appealed issue in the Supplemental Claim lane pending additional development.  See May 2021 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996); July 2021 Higher-Level Review (HLR) Rating Decision (finding that VA committed a duty to assist error by "fail[ing] to get an examination(s) and/or medical opinion(s)" to determine the nature and likely etiology of the Veteran's claimed back condition).  

Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, reflecting his desire to appeal the AOJ's April 2021 rating decision denying service connection for a low back disability, among other issues.  See July 2021 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182).  In the July 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Hearing docket, which provides an opportunity to have a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  The Veteran testified at a Board hearing in June 2023.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

?

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Meanwhile, while the appeal was pending, and prior to the Board hearing, the AOJ undertook additional evidentiary development for the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disorder, which, as noted, had been placed in the Supplemental Claim lane following the July 2021 HLR decision.  Specifically, the AOJ afforded the Veteran a VA compensation and pension (C&P) examination and etiological opinion in August 2021.  See August 2021 VA Back Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ); August 2021 VA Medical Opinion DBQ.  Thereafter, an October 2021 supplemental claim decision continued to deny service connection for a low back disorder based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  See October 2021 Rating Decision (noting that the AOJ "received [the Veteran's] request for higher-level review (HLR) on May 6, 2021"; that "during the processing of [the Veteran's HLR, the reviewer identified that additional development was required to fully and fairly decide [his] claim,"; that the Veteran's "claim was moved to the supplemental claim lane on July 15, 2021"; and that the "additional development has now been completed").  See also October 2021 VA Notification Letter (notifying the Veteran of the October 2021 decision and his appellate rights).  

The Veteran's appeal of the April 2021 decision, initiated by the July 2021 VA Form 10182, came before the Board in July 2023, at which time the Board, in relevant part, dismissed the appeal of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder, finding that the July 2021 VA Form 10182 was a prohibited concurrent election, as the Veteran attempted to appeal the claim while additional development was being conducted, prior to the issue being decided after it was returned from Higher Level Review.  See July 2023 Board Decision.  The Board concluded that dismissal of the appeal was warranted because the development ordered by the "Higher-Level Review of the claim for service connection for a low back disorder was still pending at the time the Veteran submitted the July 2021 VA Form 10182."  See id.  

The Veteran appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court/CAVC).  Pursuant to an October 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) filed by the parties, the Court vacated the portion of the Board's July 2023 decision that dismissed the appeal for service connection for a low back disorder and remanded the claim back to the Board for additional development and adjudication consistent with the terms of the JMPR.  See October 2024 JMPR; October 2024 CAVC Order.  In particular, the parties to the JMPR determined that the Board erred when it characterized the AOJ's Higher Level Review of the claim for service connection for a back disorder as "still pending" at the time the Veteran submitted his July 2021 VA Form 10182, because "VA completed the higher level review on July 16, 2021, thereafter returning [the Veteran]'s claim to the supplemental claim lane for further development."  See October 2024 JMPR.  The Parties thus agreed that remand was required because the Board "failed to provide adequate reasons or bases for finding that dismissal of the appeal of the lower back claim was warranted due to prohibited concurrent election."  Id.  

The claim has thus returned to the Board.

1. The appeal of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder is dismissed.

The parties to the October 2024 JMPR determined that the Board "erred when it failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases considering the procedural history of this case when it dismissed the lower back claim as not properly before it."  See October 2024 JMPR.  The sole basis for this determination appears to be the Board's statement that "Higher-Level Review of the claim for service connection for a low back disorder was still pending at the time the Veteran submitted the July 2021 VA Form 10182."  See id.; July 2023 Board Decision.  Notwithstanding the imprecision of the Board's characterization of the status of the higher-level review of the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disorder in that sentence, the fact remains that, at the time the Veteran filed his appeal to the Board, the claim for service connection for a low back disorder was still under review at the AOJ pursuant to the Veteran's higher-level review request, as it had been placed in the supplemental claim lane for additional evidentiary development by a higher-level reviewer at the AOJ.  In support of this, the Board's July 2023 decision detailed the relevant procedural history of the claim, including specifically the Veteran's May 2021 request for Higher Level Review of the AOJ's April 2021 denial of service connection for a low back disorder; the July 2021 HLR decision "identif[ying] a duty to assist error in the development of the claim and plac[ing] the appeal for service connection for a low back disorder in the Supplemental Claim lane pending additional development"; the Veteran's submission of a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, regarding the AOJ's April 2021 denial of service connection for a low back disability at a point "prior to the issue being decided after it was returned from Higher-Level Review," and at which time "additional development was being conducted"; and the subsequent October 2021 supplemental claim decision that again denied the claim for service connection for a low back disorder.  See id.  

In this regard, as noted in the July 2023 Board decision, under the AMA, a claimant may elect administrative review of an AOJ decision by requesting one of three review options, or lanes: (i) Higher-Level Review by the AOJ; (ii) Supplemental Claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1).  Once a claimant has filed for review under one of these options, he or she may not choose another lane of review with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is adjudicated; or until the request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).  In other words, concurrent election, or electing multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim, is prohibited.  See id.  A claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the original request and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue.  38 C.F.R. §3.2500(e)(1).

Here, although the higher-level review of the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disorder was completed on July 16, 2021 (the date of issuance of the July 2021 rating decision), the issue was not adjudicated at that time.  See VA Notification Letter dated July 16, 2021 (stating that VA has "completed [the Veteran's] request for higher-level review" on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back condition, but further informing the Veteran that the AOJ "need[s] to develop for additional evidence before [it] can properly decide [his] claim").  See also October 2024 JMPR (stating that "VA completed the higher level review on July 16, 2021, thereafter returning [the Veteran's] claim to the supplemental claim lane for further development"); July 2023 Board Decision (noting that, in July 2021, the higher-level reviewer at the AOJ "identified a pre-decisional duty to assist error in the processing of the Veteran's claim for service connection for a low back disability" and therefore "placed the appeal for service connection for a low back disorder in the Supplemental Claim lane pending additional development").  Instead, the AOJ's administrative review of the claim for service connection for a low back disorder, which was initiated by the Veteran's May 2021 request for Higher-Level Review, and which included both the higher-level review (which concluded with the July 2021 decision) and the subsequent development in the supplemental claim lane, remained "pending final adjudication" until issuance of the October 2021 supplemental claim decision that denied the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b) (reflecting that, "a claimant who has filed for review under one of the options available under paragraph (a) of this section," i.e. Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, Supplemental Claim, or appeal to the Board, "may not, while that review is pending final adjudication, file for review under a different available option").  

To be clear, the Veteran initiated administrative review of the AOJ's April 2021 denial of service connection for a low back disorder by submitting a request for higher-level review in May 2021.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(a)(1) (reflecting that "a claimant may elect one of the following administrative review options by timely filing the appropriate form prescribed by the Secretary: (i) A request for higher-level review... or (ii) An appeal to the Board...").  Final adjudication of the issue of entitlement to service connection for a low back disorder, and thus completion of the administrative review initiated by the May 2021 higher-level-review request, did not occur until the AOJ issued the October 2021 rating decision denying service connection for a low back disorder.  Thus, the AOJ's administrative review of the claim for service connection for a low back disorder was still pending at the time the Veteran submitted the July 2021 VA Form 10182.  Further, there is no indication that the Veteran attempted to withdraw his Higher-Level Review request.  

As discussed, under the AMA, a veteran may not take another action with respect to the same claim until the prior action is either adjudicated or withdrawn.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.  As such, because the Veteran filed a Board appeal of the AOJ's April 2021 denial of service connection for a low back disorder while the administrative review initiated by his May 2021 request for higher-level review of that same decision was still pending final adjudication, the appeal must be dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).
