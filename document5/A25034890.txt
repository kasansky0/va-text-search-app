ORDER

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a left hip disorder, secondary to the service-connected left knee disability, has been withdrawn and is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 6, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for a left hip disorder, secondary to the service-connected left knee disability, has been withdrawn and is dismissed.

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1970 to October 1971 and from July 1976 to June 1994.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2024 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which readjudicated the issue of entitlement to service connection for a left hip disorder, secondary to the service-connected left knee disability, but denied the claim on its merits. 

In October 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182), requesting a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge and the opportunity to submit additional evidence within 90 days after the hearing. 

In a March 2025 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, the Veteran stated that he wished to withdraw the pending claim for entitlement to service connection for a left hip disorder, secondary to the service-connected left knee disability. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
