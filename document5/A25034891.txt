DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

A November 21, 2022, effective date for the assignment of a 30 percent rating for headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

As of November 21, 2022, the Veteran's headaches caused characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a November 21, 2022, effective date for a 30 percent rating for headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2009 to July 2012. His service decorations include the Army Commendation Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

The method of determining the effective date of an increased evaluation is set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) and (b)(2), and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). The general rule with respect to the effective date of an award of increased compensation is that the effective date of such award "shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application thereof." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented by regulation which provides that the effective date for an award of increased compensation will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1).

Headaches

In this matter, the Veteran sought service connection for headaches on November 21, 2022. See November 2022 Fully Developed Claim. A February 2023 rating decision granted service connection as of the Veteran's November 2022 claim and assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) rating. The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in June 2023, seeking review of the February 2023 rating decision and a higher rating for his headaches. In the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's headaches were assigned a 30 percent rating as of his June 2023 supplemental claim. The Veteran has sought an earlier effective date for the assignment of the 30 percent rating, noting that he has continuously pursued his claim since his November 2022 application. The Board agrees.

The Veteran's headaches are rated pursuant to DC 8100. DC 8100 mandates that a 30 percent rating for headaches is assigned when the headaches are found to cause characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months. 

Concurrent with his November 21, 2022, claim for service connection, the Veteran submitted a lay statement which detailed his headaches and headache symptoms. The Veteran stated that his headaches occurred weekly and that once every couple of months his headaches knocked him out of commission to the point he was incapacitated. He reported sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and throbbing pain. He stated he took over the counter medication and has missed work due to his headaches. 

In a December 2022 VA examination, the examiner did not report any symptoms associated with the Veteran's headaches other than constant head pain.

However, in a September 2023 VA examination, the examiner reported the Veteran's headache symptoms in alignment with his November 2022 statement. Indeed, the September 2023 VA examination, which was the bases for the Veteran's increased rating, was a records review examination in which the examiner simply filled out the VA examination form from the Veteran's November 2022 statement.

As such, and based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's headaches have met the criteria for a 30 percent rating as of his November 21, 2022, claim. Clearly, if the Veteran's November 2022 statement was the basis for the June 2023 increased rating, then the basis for a 30 percent rating existed at the time the Veteran submitted his claim. 

As such, a November 21, 2022, effective date for the assignment of a 30 percent rating for the Veteran's headaches is granted.
