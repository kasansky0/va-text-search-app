REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active-duty service from June 1968 to June 1972.

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran [or representative] with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the RO issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Effective Dates

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for service connection or a claim reopened after final adjudication, "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).

The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Under the AMA, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or issue by filing a supplemental claim following notice of a decision by the AOJ or the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). For effective dates, supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the Board issues notice of the decision the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (h)(2). In AMA, all continuous pursuit options are applicable to challenge an effective date, including filing a supplemental claim with new and relevant evidence. See Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96 (2024).

An effective date of an award of benefits based on a liberalizing law is assigned in accordance with the facts found but is usually not earlier than the effective date of the liberalizing law. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (g), 38 C.F.R. § 3.114. If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of the law or VA issue, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(3).

However, the claimant must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or regulation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a). Accordingly, to qualify for an earlier effective date for service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a), there must have been evidence of a diagnosed disorder at the time of the effective date of the liberalizing law.

1. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with tremor and bradykinesia, right upper extremity

2. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with stooped posture, left side

3. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with tremor and bradykinesia, right lower extremity

4. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with tremor, left upper extremity

5. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with balance impairment, bradykinesia and slowed motion, left lower extremity

6. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with stooped posture, right side 

7. An effective date of December 14, 2015, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection of Parkinson's disease with mild neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder

The Veteran seeks earlier effective dates for the above disabilities. After a review of the evidence of record, the Board concludes that the appropriate effective date for all of the above disabilities is December 14, 2015.

As indicated above, the Veteran filed claims for Parkinson's related disabilities in December 2015. There is no indication that the AOJ adjudicated the claims until after the submission of a December 2017 claim for the same disabilities. These claims were denied by the AOJ and appealed to the Board which denied them as well in October 2021. The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in September 2022, within a year of the Board denials. As such, the Board considers them to be continuously pursued since December 14, 2015.

Therefore, the claim for an earlier effective date for the above claimed disabilities is warranted and the appropriate effective date is December 14, 2015. 

An earlier date is not warranted. The Veteran first submitted claims for Parkinson's related disabilities in 2013 and these claims were denied by the AOJ on July 1, 2014. The Veteran's next submission involving those claims was the December 2015 VA 21-526EZ, fully developed claim. With over a year elapsed since the July 1, 2014, denial, the July 2024 decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 (h)(2). As such, there is no effective date earlier than December 14, 2015, that may be assigned. The Veteran's claims are effective as of December 14, 2015, his claims requesting an earlier effective date are granted to that extent.
