DOCKET NO. 241007-482476
DATE: April 16, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1973 to February 1976.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in October 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain is remanded.

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a claim for an increased disability rating for his service-connected lumbosacral strain disability. See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, p. 4. In response to the claim, the AOJ indicated that the Veteran should be afforded a VA thoracolumbar spine conditions examination. See September 2023 Exam Request, p. 4. In September 2023, the Veteran's VA back examination was canceled, as he was found to be "unavailable." However, the claims file does not contain any evidence indicating that the Veteran was ever notified of the date, time, or location of this examination. Therefore, the Board finds that the matter must be remanded in order to afford the Veteran the opportunity to undergo the requested examination and that he is appropriately informed of such examination. The Veteran is reminded however, that the duty to assist is not a one-way street and that his claim may be rated based on the evidence of record upon readjudication if he fails to appear for a scheduled examination. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655; see also Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the nature and severity of his service-connected back disability. Any indicated evaluations, studies, or tests deemed necessary by the examiner should be accomplished. The Veteran's entire claims file, to include a copy of this remand, should be provided to the examiner.
