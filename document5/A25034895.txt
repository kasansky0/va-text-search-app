ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for anterior neck painful scar is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for anterior neck surgical scar is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine w/cervical spinal fusion and cervical spinal stenosis (neck disability) is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's anterior neck scar was shown to be painful and with two characteristics of disfigurement.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for anterior neck painful scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, 7805 (2024).

2. The criteria for a rating in excess of 30 percent for anterior neck surgical scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7801, 7802, 7804, 7805 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from April 1989 to June 1989, July 1992 to September 1992, December 1995 to June 1996, and October 2001 to September 2002. These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the February 2023 rating decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801 (2024). 

The Board acknowledges that the February 2024 VA Form 10182 contained a request for review of the effective dates assigned for the grants of entitlement to service connection for anterior neck surgical and painful scars. The Board, however, finds that the effective dates of the grants of entitlement to service connection were not addressed in the February 2023 rating decision currently on appeal and so, constitutes an invalid appeal. Furthermore, the Veteran's argument for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is not ripe for consideration as it is inextricably intertwined with separate pending appeal streams.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's neck disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Increased Rating - Anterior Neck Painful and Surgical Scar

The Veteran contends that his anterior neck painful and surgical scar is worse than that contemplated by the assigned ratings. His anterior neck scar is currently rated disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7804. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. 

In November 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner observed that the Veteran had one scar on the anterior neck. The examiner noted that the Veteran's scar was painful and tender to palpitation with surface contour elevated on palpation, hypopigmentation, and slightly irregular texture. However, the Veteran's scar was not unstable. It covered 3 square (sq.) centimeters (cm.) (or 3 cm x 1 cm), to include with hypopigmentation and abnormal texture. 

Based on the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to higher ratings. In this regard, the Veteran has one painful scar of the neck with two or three characteristics of disfigurement, to include surface contour of scar elevated or depressed on palpation and scar at least one-quarter inch (0.6 cm.) wide at widest part. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800 and 7804. There is no evidence that the Veteran's scar showed visible or palpable tissue loss and either gross distortion or asymmetry of two features or paired sets of features (nose, chin, forehead, eyes (including eyelids), ears (auricles), cheeks, lips); or with four or five characteristics of disfigurement. Id. at Diagnostic Code 7800. The Veteran's single scar was not shown to be unstable. Id. at Diagnostic Code 7804. Furthermore, the Veteran has not alleged, nor does the evidence suggest, that his anterior neck scar results in any disabling effects. Id. at Diagnostic Code 7805. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance, and entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for anterior neck painful scar and a rating in excess of 30 percent for anterior neck surgical scar is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Increased Rating

Prior to issuing the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in November 2022. The Veteran reported worsening neck pain with repetitive movements and functional loss which required that he stay in bed all day. Without considering all procurable and assembled data, the examiner failed to provide range of motion degree estimates with repeated use over time. Therefore, a remand is required for corrective action.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current level of severity of all impairment resulting from his service-connected neck disability. The claims file must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner. Any indicated studies must be performed. The examiner should provide all information required for rating purposes, to specifically include a discussion of the Veteran's flare-ups and functional loss.
