REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Air Force from October 1989 to November 1990.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

By way of history, in a July 24, 2023, rating decision, a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denied the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  

On July 25, 2023, the Veteran submitted VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 24, 2023, rating decision denying the issues on appeal.  

In November 2023, the HLR found that additional development was required and placed the appeal in the Supplemental Claim lane.  

In an August 2024 rating decision, the RO determined that the issues of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus remained denied, as new and relevant evidence had not been submitted in support of the claims.  However, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the claims on the merits.  Thus, adjudication on the merits was an implicit favorable finding by which the Board is bound.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Then, in September 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), appealing the August 2024 rating decision.  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  She acknowledged that Direct Review would entail the Board reviewing the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision, with no evidence submission or hearing requests.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2024 decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The Board notes the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, the rating decision on appeal was issued on August 19, 2024.  Thus, the one-year period following the decision has not yet elapsed.  However, the decision below represents a complete grant of the benefits sought.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice with the Board adjudicating the claims prior to the expiration of the one-year period, and delaying adjudication would needlessly delay the award of benefits to the Veteran with no potential benefit.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claims.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as hearing loss and tinnitus, a presumption of service connection arises if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within one year following discharge from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1131, 1133, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the veteran.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  Board determinations with respect to the weight and credibility of evidence are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 465.  Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159; see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.  

See discussion in Paragraph 2

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  She asserts that her hearing loss and tinnitus are directly related to acoustic trauma sustained in service.  

Hearing loss and tinnitus are recognized by VA as "chronic diseases" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply.  Walker, 708 F.3d 1335-1337; Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).  

Favorable findings from the August 2024 rating decision on appeal include current diagnoses of bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus, as well as exposure to hazardous noise in military service due to the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of Pilot Trainee.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.  

Next, as to continuity, the Veteran has indicated that she has experienced hearing loss and tinnitus since service.  See April 2023 VA Form 21-4138.  While there is an absence of complaints of or treatment for hearing loss or tinnitus for many years after service separation, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in her favor and finds that she had continuous symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus since service separation and meets the requirements of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  

Finally, as to nexus, on examination in July 2023, the VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion for both hearing loss and tinnitus.  As rationale, the examiner stated that normal hearing sensitivity was evidenced with evaluation at entrance and separation with no significant change in thresholds.  The examiner further stated that there is no evidence available in the Veteran's service medical records that support the current tinnitus being related to military service.  Thus, the opinions relied heavily on the lack of documented hearing loss and symptoms of tinnitus during service.  The Board finds the July 2023 VA opinions to be inadequate, as the lack of in-service evidence alone is not a sufficient rationale to support a negative opinion.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

While the record does not include a medical opinion that indicates a nexus between the Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus with service, the Board does not need to reach the weight assignable to any medical opinion because service connection is granted on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the "chronic diseases" of hearing loss and tinnitus (38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a)) based on a finding of "continuous" symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus since service rather than on direct service connection.  

In sum, there is evidence of acoustic trauma in service and continuous symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus since service; therefore, hearing loss and tinnitus are presumed to have been incurred in service and the appeal is granted.  Because the Board is granting service connection on a presumptive basis based on continuous symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus since service separation, all other service connection theories are rendered moot.
