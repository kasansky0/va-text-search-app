FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's alopecia areata resulted in hair loss limited to scalp and face.

2. The Veteran's cerumen impaction does not result in swelling, dry and scaly or serous discharge, and itching requiring frequent and prolonged treatment.

3. The Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB) affected less than five percent of the entire body and required no more than topical therapy during the past twelve-month period.

4. At no point prior to beginning medication did the Veteran's hypertension manifest as diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, and at no point during the appeal period did his hypertension manifest with diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2016 to June 2023, with additional service in the Army National Guard. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of rating decisions issued in September 2023 and February 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal for the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension, and the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal for the issues of entitlement to initial compensable ratings for alopecia areata, cerumen impaction, and PFB. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Under certain circumstances, a claim for a total disability rating based on unemployability (TDIU) may be inferred as part of an increased rating claim. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-55 (2009). The facts of this case do not raise the issue. The Veteran has not contended, nor does the record raise, that any of the service-connected conditions on appeal prevent him from obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment. Thus, there is no inferred TDIU claim.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for alopecia areata

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his service-connected alopecia areata. 

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for alopecia areata, effective June 19, 2023, and assigned a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7831. The applicable rating period is from June 19, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection, through February 23, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The period on review currently before the Board under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) is limited to the period considered by the AOJ (i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal), as that is when the evidentiary record closed.

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Different ratings may be assigned for different periods of time for the same disorder if the facts show distinct time periods with different levels of disability. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Diagnostic Code 7831 is for alopecia areata. A 0 percent rating is warranted with hair loss limited to scalp and face. A 10 percent rating is warranted with loss of all body hair. 

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran does not receive treatment for this condition from VA. There are no private treatment records associated with the claims file that document the Veteran's alopecia areata during the rating period. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his alopecia areata in September 2023. The examiner noted a diagnosis of alopecia, as well as additional skin conditions of tinea capitis, tinea pedis, and onychomycosis. The Veteran reported "missing hair" from his head shortly after basic training in 2016, stating that he noticed his scalp had areas where there was no hair regrowth. He did not use any treatment for his alopecia areata. The examiner noted that the Veteran's alopecia areata results in hair loss limited to scalp and face. None of the Veteran's skin conditions caused scarring. The examiner noted no functional impact of the Veteran's alopecia areata. 

The Board finds that a compensable rating for alopecia areata is not warranted. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's alopecia areata results in hair loss limited to scalp and face, as contemplated by the Veteran's current noncompensable rating. The medical evidence does not show, nor has the Veteran contended, that his alopecia areata results in loss of all body hair as contemplated by the next highest rating. The Board has also considered other Diagnostic Codes that are potentially relevant to the Veteran's claim. Scars of the head are evaluated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7804, and 7805. Scarring alopecia is rated under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7830. However, the September 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any scars related to the condition on appeal.

The evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating during the period on appeal. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). For these reasons, the claim is denied.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for cerumen impaction

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his service-connected cerumen impaction. 

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for cerumen impaction, effective June 19, 2023, and assigned a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6210. The applicable rating period is from June 19, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection, through February 23, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The period on review currently before the Board under the AMA is limited to the period considered by the AOJ (i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal), as that is when the evidentiary record closed.

Cerumen impaction does not have a specific diagnostic code, so it is rated by analogy under a diagnostic code for a closely related disability that affects the same anatomical functions and has closely analogous symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20. Diagnostic Code 6210 is for chronic otitis externa. A 10 percent rating is warranted for swelling, dry and scaly or serous discharge, and itching requiring frequent and prolonged treatment. 

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran does not receive treatment for this condition from VA. There are no private treatment records associated with the claims file that document the Veteran's cerumen impaction during the rating period. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his cerumen impaction in December 2023. The examiner noted a diagnosis of cerumen impaction, that the Veteran reported onset in 2015 while in service when he noticed his hearing was reduced in both ears. He stated that he was told that he needed his earwax cleaned out, which improved symptoms. He denied a history of ear pain or infection and noted that he recently noticed a problem again. He reported that his current symptoms were buildup of earwax, which affects his hearing. He reported treating his condition with ear lavages. On examination, the Veteran had no signs of a vestibular condition. He had no signs or symptoms attributable to chronic ear infection, inflammation, cholesteatoma, or cerumen impaction. His external ear, tympanic membrane, gait, Romberg test, Dix Hallpike test, and limb coordination test were normal. His ear canal was abnormal, with minimal cerumen bilaterally. He did not have a benign or malignant neoplasm or metastasis related to his cerumen impaction. There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, signs or symptoms related to his cerumen impaction. The examiner noted no functional impact due to the Veteran's cerumen impaction. 

The Board finds that a compensable rating for cerumen impaction is not warranted. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's cerumen impaction does not result in swelling, dry and scaly or serous discharge, and itching requiring frequent and prolonged treatment that would warrant a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 6210. The Board has considered whether other diagnostic codes under 38 C.F.R. § 4.87 would result in a compensable rating for the Veteran's cerumen impaction. However, record does not show nor has the Veteran has reported any symptoms that would warrant a rating under any other diagnostic code. The Veteran noted during the December 2023 VA examination that his cerumen impaction affects his hearing, and the Board has considered whether a rating under Diagnostic Code 6100 for hearing impairment is warranted. However, the Veteran did not report nor does the record suggest that he has hearing loss according to VA's standards. Instead, the Veteran reported that his hearing was affected by his cerumen impaction, which improved when he has his earwax cleared out. Further, a VA audiogram conducted during the rating period in July 2023 noted normal hearing in both ears. 

The evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating during the period on appeal. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). For these reasons, the claim is denied.

3. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB)

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his service-connected PFB.

The February 2024 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for PFB, effective June 19, 2023, and assigned a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7813. The applicable rating period is from June 19, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection, through February 23, 2024, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The period on review currently before the Board under the AMA is limited to the period considered by the AOJ (i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal), as that is when the evidentiary record closed.

PFB does not have a specific diagnostic code, so it is rated by analogy under a diagnostic code for a closely related disability that affects the same anatomical functions and has closely analogous symptomatology. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.20. Diagnostic Code 7813, which uses the General Rating Formula for the Skin, is for dermatophytosis. 

Under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, a noncompensable rating is warranted where the condition requires no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.

A 10 percent rating is warranted where the condition involves characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

VA regulations clarify that systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 (a).

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran does not receive treatment for this condition from VA. There are no private treatment records associated with the claims file that document the Veteran's PFB during the rating period.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his PFB in December 2023. The examiner noted a diagnosis of PFB which the Veteran reported onset in 2015 while in service, with symptoms of redness, bumps, and irritation around the chin due to shaving. He noted that he currently experiences the same symptoms. He denied using any treatment for this condition. On examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran's characteristic lesions due to his PFB covered less than five percent of his total body area, and less than five percent of his total exposed body area. He did not have scarring due to his PFB. The examiner noted no functional impact due to the Veteran's PFB.

The Board finds that a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected PFB is not warranted. The evidence of record shows that the Veteran's PFB does not meet the requisite coverage area or use of intermittent systemic therapy required for a compensable rating under the General Rating Formula For the Skin. During the rating period, the Veteran's PFB manifested as redness, bumps, and irritation around the chin area that covered less than five percent of his total body area and less than five percent of his total exposed body area. He reported using no treatment for this condition. During the appeal period, his PFB did not meet any of the criteria for the next highest rating. His PFB did not manifest as characteristic lesions involving at least five percent, but less than twenty percent, of the entire body, or at least five percent, but less than twenty percent, of exposed areas. Additionally, he did not require intermittent systemic therapy for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran may be entitled to a compensable rating under Diagnostic Code 7804, which compensates for unstable or painful scars, but the December 2023 VA examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any scars related to the condition on appeal. 

The evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating during the period on appeal. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). For these reasons, the claim is denied.

4. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension

The Veteran seeks an initial compensable rating for his service-connected hypertension.

The September 2023 rating decision on appeal granted service connection for hypertension, effective June 19, 2023, and assigned a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. The applicable rating period is from June 19, 2023, the effective date for the award of service connection, through September 29, 2023, the date of the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The period on review currently before the Board under the AMA is limited to the period considered by the AOJ (i.e., ends at the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal), as that is when the evidentiary record closed.

Diagnostic Code 7101 is for hypertension. Under Diagnostic Code 7101,

"	a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control;

"	a 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more;

"	a 40 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more; and

"	a 60 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.

The word "predominantly" is not defined in the Rating Schedule. According to Merriam-Webster, "predominant" is defined as "being most frequent or common." See Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant. The use of such terminology by VA examiners or other physicians, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence is evaluated in determining an increased rating. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran does not receive treatment for this condition from VA. There are no private treatment records associated with the claims file that document the Veteran's hypertension during the rating period. However, the plain text of Diagnostic Code 7101 directs VA to consider historical, rather than current, blood pressure readings and that the relevant "historical blood pressure readings" are those taken before the Veteran began medication. See Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75, 81 (2021). Thus, the Board will consider the Veteran's service treatment records (STR), as they contain historical blood pressure readings. 

STRs show that the Veteran was prescribed Amlodipine for his hypertension in August 2022. STRs document over 40 blood pressure readings recorded prior to the Veteran starting medication, ranging from March 2015 to August 2022. These records show two instances of diastolic pressure at 100 or greater taken prior to the Veteran beginning medication, with readings of 162/100 and 168/100 in May 2022. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his hypertension in September 2023. The Veteran noted a diagnosis of hypertension, for which the Veteran reported taking Amlodipine daily. The examiner recorded his blood pressure at 163/97, 154/96, and 147/98. The examiner noted no functional impact due to the Veteran's hypertension. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected hypertension did not manifest with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 prior to beginning medication and does not currently manifest as diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. The record shows that presently, the Veteran's hypertension is controlled with medication, with his diastolic pressure predominantly under 100 and his systolic pressure predominantly under 160. The only blood pressure readings in the record taken during the appeal period were those taken during the September 2023 VA examination, which noted one instance out of three readings where the Veteran's systolic pressure was at 160 or more, and no instances out of three readings where his diastolic pressure was at 100 or more. Further, of the over 40 readings taken prior to the Veteran starting medication in August 2022, only two times did his diastolic pressure reach 100 or more. Thus, the Veteran's hypertension has not manifested the degree of severity envisioned by the 10 percent rating.

The evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable rating during the period on appeal. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). For these reasons, the claim is denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
