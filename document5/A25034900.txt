REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for headaches (claimed as migraines) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1981 to April 1987. The Board is grateful to the Veteran for his honorable service.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.). This law created a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review.

By way of procedural history, on November 3, 2022, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying service connection for headaches. On June 27, 2023, the Veteran filed two separate VA Form 10182s, selecting both the Direct Review and Evidence Submission dockets, for the same issue of service connection for headaches. 

In Terry v. McDonough, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) emphasized that concurrent elections are prohibited. The Court held that "a claimant is able to select a second administrative review option with respect to a decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run and the second administrative review option does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option." 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023). The Court's holding was expressly predicated on finding that multiple administrative review requests were "not pending concurrently" because this would be prohibited under 38 U.S.C. § 5104C (a)(2)(A). Id. at 2. As such, the Court's holding in Terry makes shows only one administrative review option can be pursued at a time for any given issue or issues. Id. 

On June 29, 2023, a BVA docketing letter was provided notifying the Veteran that his VA Form 10182 submitted on June 27, 2023, electing the Direct Review, was placed on the Direct Review docket. However, on February 4, 2025, the Board informed the Veteran that they could not accept the June 27, 2023, VA Form 10182, Direct Review, because the Veteran submitted two VA Form 10182s on the same day, for the same issue. The clarification letter stated that in order for the Board to process the appeal, the Veteran would have to submit another VA Form 10182 within 60 days of February 4, 2025. The clarification letter noted that if a new form was not received within 60 days the appeal would be dismissed. 

Here, the Board received a new VA Form 10182 on March 4, 2025, where the Veteran elected Direct Review, clarifying his appeal to proceed with the issue of service connection for migraines. As such, the issue for service connection for migraines under Direct Review is now properly before the Board. 

Under the AMA, a remand is available only to correct pre-decisional errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The claim is being remanded to correct certain pre-decisional errors, as further explained below.

Entitlement to service connection for headaches (claimed as migraines).

First, the Board notes that it is bound by the favorable findings made by the AOJ in the November 2022 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). The AOJ found that the Veteran had a qualifying in-service event occur in January 1986 when an acute finding of headaches was reported. Therefore, it is conceded that the Veteran had headaches during active service.

Next, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran submitted a number of private treatment records in September 2022. An October 2020 Neuropsychological Assessment Report, associated with the September 2022 record submission, notes that the Veteran has current cluster attacks and cluster headaches. The examiner noted that the Veteran had current headaches and that they got worse in 2018. Additionally, a private treatment note from UCLA health in March 2021, also associated with the September 2022 record submission, indicated that a doctor had examined the Veteran and stated that he had a current diagnosis of cluster attacks/cluster headaches and migraines.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for his headaches in September 2022. The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's headaches had resolved. The VA examiner did not discuss the Veteran's private treatment records submitted in September 2022, which showed current treatment and a current diagnosis for headaches. A rationale for why or how the headaches resolved was not submitted by the September 2022 VA examiner. Second, the VA examiner's rationale for stating that the Veteran's headaches were less likely than not related to service was only one sentence and omitted any discussion of the Veteran's lay statements that his headaches have continued since service. See June 2023 Correspondence. Additionally, the VA examiner did not comment on or discuss the Veteran's February 2017 and August 2018 emergency room visits for headaches or his 2005 MRI brain scan.

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate, see Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 310-11 (2007), which in this context requires that an examination report sufficiently inform the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question, rely upon accurate factual premises, including the Veteran's lay statements regarding symptomatology, and present a fully articulated, sound rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). 

Here, the September 2022 VA medical opinion lacks the necessary rationale required to provide an adequate opinion to rely on. In this instance, the September 2022 opinion does not provide the Board with a sufficient reasoned rationale or medical explanation supporting the reached conclusion. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("a medical opinion...must support its conclusion with analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

Additionally, the Board acknowledges that the October 2020 Neuropsychological Assessment Report, noted that the Veteran has had a medical history of migraines since the age of 13, including cluster attacks and cluster headaches. Subsequently, a rating decision was issued in November 2022, but the examiner's assertions of the Veteran's migraines existing prior to service were not considered. While the Veteran's entrance examination does not demonstrate evidence of headaches, the assertion regarding migraines being a preexisting condition has never been adequately addressed. 

When the Board identifies a pre-decisional duty to assist error in an AMA appeal, under Pub. L. No. 115-55, section 2(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159(c), 20.802(a) (2019), the Board will remand the appeal back to the AOJ with instructions to correct the error. Following correction of the error, the AOJ must readjudicate the issue. Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 2(d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2502 (2019). As such, there were pre-decisional errors in not obtaining a VA examination and VA addendum medical opinion prior to the November 2022 rating decision on appeal. In order that the Veteran be given every reasonable opportunity to prove his claim, the Board finds that a new VA examination and VA medical opinion are warranted to determine the current nature and etiology of the Veteran's headache condition.

Although the Board regrets this delay, such a remand is necessary to ensure fair and appropriate adjudication of the Veteran's claim consistent with VA's duties to assist.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the claims file to a VA examiner of appropriate expertise in order to determine the etiology of the Veteran's headache condition. Afford the Veteran an appropriate VA examination, in-person if possible, with respect to the Veteran's headache condition. The medical professional must review the Veteran's claims file, including this remand, and explain the complete rationale for all opinions expressed and conclusions reached. All headache conditions should be listed.

Following consideration of the evidence of record (both lay and medical), the examiner is asked to offer the following opinion:

Whether the Veteran's headache condition clearly and unmistakably (obviously or manifestly) existed prior to active service. If such a disorder pre-existed service, what was the most probable diagnosis.

If the headache condition clearly and unmistakably existed prior to active service, provide an opinion as to whether such disorder clearly and unmistakably (obviously or manifestly) was not aggravated during the Veteran's active service; and

If the headache condition did not preexist service, provide a direct service connection opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not (i.e. the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headache condition is directly related to service.

The VA examiner should note that the November 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran had a qualifying in-service event occur in January 1986 when an acute finding of headaches was reported.

The VA examiner must also consider the following: 

(1) the findings of the An October 2020 Neuropsychological Assessment Report, which notes that the Veteran has current cluster attacks and cluster headaches; and (2) the March 2021 UCLA health note where a doctor had examined the Veteran and stated that he had a current diagnosis of cluster attacks/cluster headaches and migraines; and (3) the Veteran's February 2017 and August 2018 emergency room visits for headaches as well as his 2005 MRI brain scan.

A complete rationale for the examiner's opinions should be provided, citing to specific evidence of record, as necessary. If the examiner cannot provide opinions without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

If the inability to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation is due to a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), the AOJ should develop the claim to the extent it is necessary to cure any such deficiency. If the inability to provide an opinion is due to the examiner's lack of requisite knowledge or training, then the AOJ should obtain an opinion from a medical professional who has the knowledge and training needed to render such an opinion.
