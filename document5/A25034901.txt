DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left knee strain is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for right knee strain is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

An appeal for entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability and a right knee disability is pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) in a separate appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for left knee strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2024).

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for right knee strain have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty from March 1986 to June 1995. He has another period of active-duty service from June 1995 to December 1998 that has been deemed dishonorable for VA purposes.

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

The Board notes that the other issues listed in the October 2024 Notice of Disagreement are not on appeal in this matter because they are on appeal in separate appeals and otherwise would be untimely. The issue related to a respiratory disorder was appealed in an April 5, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, with a docket switch request in a December 27, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, and it remains pending in a separate appeal. The issue related to specially adapted housing was appealed in a November 8, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, with a docket switch request in the December 27, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, and that appeal also remains pending. Finally, the issue related to fatigue was an attempted appeal of the deferment of adjudication by the AOJ, which is not an appealable decision. Regardless, the issue of service connection for fatigue remains pending, as it was appealed in an April 5, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, with a docket switch request in the December 27, 2023 Notice of Disagreement.  

Both issues on appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

As pertinent to this matter, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, in March 2022. He thereafter continuously pursued the claim, with the most recent review request selection being a Board appeal in an April 18, 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), seeking review of an April 2023 rating decision. In a December 27, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, he requested to switch the Board docket chosen to the Hearing docket. He was notified that these issues were placed on the Hearing docket in January 2024 correspondence. The appeal remains pending.

In December 2023, while the Board appeal remained pending, VA received a supplemental claim. This is considered impermissible concurrent election. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). However, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) adjudicated the supplemental claim in a January 2024 rating decision, which the Veteran appealed in the current matter in an October 2024 Notice of Disagreement.

The Board notes that the Veteran originally filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review in January 2024, but the AOJ correctly rejected that review request because an appeal was pending before the Board. See February 2024 correspondence.

The issues related to the Veteran's knees must be dismissed because they are already pending in a separate appeal, as appealed in the April 18, 2023 Notice of Disagreement, with the docket switch request in the December 27, 2023 Notice of Disagreement. The dismissal herein will not affect the separate appeal and will cause no prejudice to the Veteran.
