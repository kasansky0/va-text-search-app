ORDER

Entitlement to a disability evaluation in excess of 60 percent, prior to July 6, 2023, for congestive heart failure is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to July 6, 2023, Veteran's congestive heart failure did not manifest in workload of 3 METs (metabolic equivalent) or less resulting in heart failure symptoms. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for evaluation in excess of 60 percent for congestive heart failure prior to July 6, 2023, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.104, DC 7005.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1995 to May 2010. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

As a procedural matter, the Board notes that the Veteran initially filed his VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement in December 2023, however it did not include Veteran's signature. Upon request from the Board, the Veteran submitted a signed copy in January 2024. However, the corrected version was not processed and docketed until August 2024. 

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where a claimant appeals the initial rating assigned following an award of service connection, evidence contemporaneous with the claim for service connection and with the rating decision granting service connection would be most probative of the degree of disability existing at the time that the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence used to decide whether an initial rating on appeal was erroneous. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

That said, higher evaluations may be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).  This practice is known as staged ratings.  Id.

When the evidence is in approximate balance in the veteran's favor or nearly equal regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 60 percent for congestive heart failure prior to July 6, 2023.

The Veteran asserts that a 100 percent disability rating should be granted with an effective date prior to July 6, 2023. See January 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement. However, the Board notes that in the rating decision on appeal the AOJ granted service connection for congestive heart failure with a 60 percent rating, effective February 2, 2022, and a maximum 100 percent rating, effective July 6, 2023. Thus, the Board acknowledges that it is a staged rating, and will address this appeal for increased rating accordingly, as a claim for disability rating in excess of 60 percent prior to July 6, 2023. 

The period on appeal begins on February 2, 2022, the effective date of service connection for congestive heart failure, and ends on July 6, 2023, the effective date for the maximum disability rating for congestive heart failure. 

The Veteran's congestive heart failure has been rated under the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 7005.

Diagnostic Code 7005 provides compensation arteriosclerotic heart disease. Effective November 14, 2021, this diagnostic code is rated under a General Rating Formula for diseases of the heart. A 10 percent rating is provided for a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or continuous medication required for control. A 30 percent rating is provided for a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms; or evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). A 60 percent rating is provided for a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating is provided for a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

One MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note 2.

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes May 2022 examination, VAMC treatment notes, and private treatment records. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

In the May 2022 VA Examination, the examiner assigned a diagnosis of acute congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF). She noted that the Veteran was hospitalized for hypertensive emergency with heart failure in January 2022. The Veteran reported that his condition improved since then, but that he was not "100 percent better." She also noted that Veteran's condition requires continuous medication for control, specifically lisinopril, hydralazine, carvedilol, spironolactone, and isosorbide mononitrate. There was no evidence of myocardial infraction, heart valve condition, arrythmia, infectious heart condition or aortic aneurysm. The examiner noted that the Veteran was hospitalized for seven days in January 2022 for hypertensive emergency with acute decompensated heart failure (ejection fraction 30-35%).  

With regards to the MET testing, the estimated interview-based METs level due solely to the cardiac condition was 3.1-5.0 METs, reflecting the lowest level of activity at which the Veteran reported symptoms including fatigue, and dyspnea on exertion. This METs level is consistent with activities such as light yard work (weeding), mowing lawn (power power), and brisk walking (4 MPH). No exercise stress test was performed. Finally, the examiner noted Veteran's reports of his disability impacting his ability to work due to him tiring more easily. The Veteran reported current part time work answering calls on technical support issues. He previously worked full time as home security technician.     

The Veteran's private treatment records include a record of a primary care visit in March 2023. At the time of the visit the Veteran reported his prior hospitalization for heart failure. He stated that he was still taking Coreg, atorvastatin, spironolactone, and hydralazine. He reported not taking lisinopril and amlodipine. The Veteran denied having any chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, pounding in the chest or difficulty breathing. He reported experiencing leg swelling and elevated blood pressure. There was no indication that METs testing was performed during that visit. See May 2023 Private treatment records. 

In sum, the Board finds that the maximum 100 percent rating is not warranted during the period on appeal. As noted above, the 100 percent rating requires a workload of 3.0 METs or less that result in heart failure symptoms. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. Here, the Veteran has not been found to have heart failure symptoms at a workload of 3 METs or less prior to July 6, 2023. The only METs testing during the relevant period, which occurred during the May 2022 VA examination found the METs level of 3.1 - 5.0. As such, a rating in excess of 60 percent is not warranted at any time prior to July 6, 2023. 

Further, the Board has considered whether a separate or higher rating may be assigned for the Veteran's congestive heart failure. There is no evidence, however, that rating the disability under a different diagnostic code in 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, would result in a higher rating. First, the Board notes that since majority of the relevant diagnostic codes use the general rating formula for diseases of the heart, the rating criteria would be the same as for DC 7005, and thus result in the same rating. The Board notes that diagnostic code 7020, cardiomyopathy, provides that a 100 percent rating is warranted in case of a chronic congestive heart failure; or workload of 3 METs or less resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness or syncope, or left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent. However, in the Veteran's case, he does not have a diagnosis of a chronic congestive heart failure, but rather an acute one, due to hypertensive emergency. Moreover, the ejection factor noted at the time of Veteran's hospitalization was 30 to 35 percent. Thus, a higher rating under DC 7020 is not warranted.

Therefore, the Board finds that for the period on appeal beginning on February 2, 2022, and ending on July 5, 2023, the Veteran's congestive heart failure warrants a 60 percent disability rating, but no higher. Since the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim for an increased rating is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
