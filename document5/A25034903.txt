REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis (claimed as retrolisthesis) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 2012 to November 2013.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis (claimed as retrolisthesis), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The denial of due process may include issuing a Board decision prior to the expiration of the one-year period for a claimant to request a docket change. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). In this case, the Board is not rendering a decision on the merits but remanding the case. Accordingly, the Veteran's due process rights are not adversely affected by not waiting until June 17, 2025, the end of the period in which to request a docket change.

Service Connection?? 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during the service - the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).?? 

In addition, service connection for certain chronic diseases may be established on a presumptive basis by showing that the condition manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a); Fountain v. McDonald, 27?Vet. App.?258, 271-72 (2015). Although the disease need not be diagnosed within the presumption period, it must be shown, by acceptable lay or medical evidence, that there were characteristic manifestations of the disease to the required degree during that time. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).?? 

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F. 3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).?? 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Entitlement to service connection for spondylolisthesis (claimed as retrolisthesis).

In his February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), the Veteran asserted that he is entitled to service connection for retrolisthesis. He wrote that he started experiencing pain, numbness, tingling and burning down his right arm and into his shoulder and neck shortly after he graduated from infantry training. The Veteran further noted that he went to Medical when he was in Airborne School but did not receive an accurate diagnosis. Finally, he added that he went through physical therapy until he exited the military.

Service treatment records (STRs) are consistent with the Veteran's assertions and note a history of pinched nerve in the neck. In addition, STRs reveal that the Veteran complained of shoulder pain/arthralgia and cervicalgia while on active duty. Imaging showed no traumatic or degenerative abnormality of the cervical spine. The Veteran underwent physical therapy which showed an improvement in his cervical range of motion but no improvement in his radicular pain after two months.

Post-service VA records show ongoing complaints. For example, the Veteran complained of tension at the neck and shoulder in March 2019. He later reported back and neck pain affecting his sleep in October 2021. In September 2023, he sought treatment for right shoulder pain and stated that he had been experiencing pain for ten years. Imaging of the neck from March 2023 showed some degenerative changes and he was referred to physical therapy.

Despite the medical evidence above, and the Veteran's application for benefits in which he specifically reported symptoms affecting his right arm, shoulder, and neck, a VA examination and medical opinion was ordered to assess the Veteran's mid and lower back. See February 2024 Exam Scheduling Request Clarification Response, April 2024 Back (Thoracolumbar Spine) Conditions Disability Benefits Questionnaire, April 2024 Medical Opinion, and April 2024 Diagnostic Imaging Report. When asked to describe the history of his back condition during the April 2024 VA examination, the Veteran stated that he started to feel pain in his neck and shoulders during physical training in 2012, and that he was diagnosed with retrolisthesis in 2023. The record contains no contentions from the Veteran regarding his low back. 

Nonetheless, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with spondylolisthesis, and the June 2024 rating decision denied service connection for "spondylolisthesis (claimed as retrolisthesis) low back." 

The Board finds that remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).?Specifically, the Board finds the April 2024 VA examination to be inadequate, as it did not determine the nature, etiology, and diagnosis of the Veteran's cervical spine condition. In addition, the VA examiner did not provide a medical nexus opinion that considers service connection based on the Veteran's claimed retrolisthesis.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination with a qualified examiner for the Veteran's claim for service connection for a cervical spine condition.

The examiner is to address the following:

(a)	Determine whether the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of a musculoskeletal disability of the cervical spine.

(b)	For each condition diagnosed in (a), determine whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the condition was incurred in service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

A complete rationale for the opinion must be provided. If the clinician cannot provide a requested opinion without resorting to speculation, it must be so stated, and the clinician must provide the reasons why an opinion would require speculation. The clinician must indicate whether there was any further need for information or testing necessary to make a determination. Additionally, the clinician must indicate whether any opinion could not be rendered due to imitations of knowledge in the medical community at large and not those of the particular examiner.
