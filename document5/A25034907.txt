ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for extraction of wisdom teeth is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Extraction of wisdom teeth due to crowding issues is not a condition contemplated by the Rating Schedule for VA disability compensation purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for extraction of wisdom teeth have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1154(a), 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.326, 3.655, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.41.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. from March 2009 to April 2010.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Following a February 2024 request for higher-level review and a June 2024 rating decision, this timely appeal of the denial followed.

In the July 2024 notice of disagreement, Ithe Veteran selected the Direct Review option. As a result, the Board's decision on this appeal must be based exclusively on evidence already of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal was issued.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Any evidence added to the record after the rating decision on appeal was issued may be resubmitted along with a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), however, and if that evidence is new and relevant, it will be considered when the claim is readjudicated.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Instructions concerning supplemental claims are included with this decision.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed and carefully considered the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision. However, in this decision the Board's focus is on the specific issues at hand and the items of evidence material to resolving those issues. Therefore, failure to reference a particular item of evidence should not be interpreted as an indication it was not reviewed and considered, but rather that it did not significantly affect the outcome of the appeal. See Timberlake v. Gober,14 Vet. App. 122, 129 (2000); Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81(Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F. 4th 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2023).   

The matter is now before the Board for consideration.

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

To establish entitlement to service connection, there must be: (1) competent and credible evidence confirming the Veteran has the claimed disability or at least has since filing the claim; (2) competent and credible evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or injury; and (3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus or link between the in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

1. Entitlement to service connection for extraction of wisdom teeth.

Analysis

The first requirement for service connection is competent and credible evidence of a current disability, or in the alternative, evidence of the existence of a disability at some point during the relevant period on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  

The Veteran presented for a dental exam during basic training in the U.S. Navy after a reported "4-5 yr" gap without dental treatment.  Findings included a "moderate" risk of periodontal disease and overcrowding of teeth.  See March 2009 NDC Great Lakes Caries and Periodontal Risk Tracking Form, March 2009 Dental Treatment Note, March 2009 Dental Examination (Accession), and March 2009 Request for Administration of Anesthesia and for Performance of Operations and Other Procedures.   

Having consented to the removal of three wisdom teeth to address the overcrowding issue, the Veteran's claim for service connection is based on a procedure for a condition that is not contemplated by the Rating Schedule for VA disability compensation purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, Schedule of ratings - dental and oral conditions.

A disability for VA compensation purposes refers to an impairment of earning capacity due to a disease or injury, rather than to a disease or injury itself.  See Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  In this case, there is no medical evidence of record that the Veteran's wisdom teeth extractions, on their own, have caused any impairment of earning capacity or is reflective of another disease or injury for which service connection may be granted.  See Larson v. McDonough, 10 F. 4th 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citing Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F. 3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2018)).  Most importantly, the Veteran has not alleged any such impairment.  See April 2010 Report of Medical Examination, April 2010 Report of Medical History, March 2011 Dental Examination (Periodic), and April 2022 Primary Care Associates of Hagerstown Visit Note.

In the absence of proof of a current disability for which service connection may be granted, there can be no valid claim.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Without evidence of a disease or injury for which service connection is an available remedy, there is no need for the Board to address the remaining elements of service connection, to include presumptive service connection.  

Conclusion

In summary, wisdom teeth extractions due to overcrowding is not condition recognized by the Rating Schedule for VA disability compensation purposes.  In the absence of a recognized disability for VA rating purposes, the Veteran's claim for service connection is defective.  The Board cannot award disability benefits where a disability does not exist.

The Board sympathizes with the Veteran.  However, the Board is bound by the law and is without authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis, regardless of financial need.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 7104; see also Kelly v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 171, 172 (1992) (noting that VA cannot extend benefits out of sympathy for a particular appellant, further noting that a law that is plain is binding and leaves nothing for interpretation.)  The Board further observes that no equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment of the United States Treasury which has not been provided for by Congress.  See Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33 (1992), citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 426 (1990).

In conclusion, service connection for extraction of wisdom teeth is not warranted, and the claim must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1961 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

It is important to consider that a denial provides finality as to this appeal, but not necessarily as to the underlying claim, because the claim will be readjudicated by the AOJ if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim along with new and relevant evidence.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A) and (B) (while a veteran may not pursue both a Board appeal and a supplemental claim simultaneously, there is no prohibition on doing so in succession); 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501 (the AOJ will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is submitted with a supplemental claim). 

In this case, examples of new and relevant may a more detailed explanation of any functional impairment caused by the claimed condition, or a formal diagnosis of a condition expressly contemplated by the Rating Schedule along with a nexus opinion from a qualified clinician.

Additionally, the Board observes if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim within one year of this decision, that claim will constitute "continuous pursuit" of the issue, and therefore the date of his original claim, not the new supplemental claim, will apply for purposes of determining the effective date of any award of benefits based on the readjudication.; 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2024) (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).
