ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

Hypertension was not diagnosed within one year of service and is not etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from July 1991 to February 1997.  

The decision on appeal was issued on January 3, 2024, with a nice letter dated on January 5, 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

The Veteran timely appealed the January 2024 rating decision in August 2024.  The Veteran requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.

In the notice of disagreement received in August 2024, the Veteran disagreed with the denial-of-service connection for hypertension in the January 2024 rating decision.  Although the Veteran indicated that he also was disagreeing with the zero percent rating assigned, a rating was not assigned for hypertension as the AOJ denied service connection.  The Veteran in the August 2024 notice of disagreement also clearly disagreed with the denials of service connection for right elbow, right knee, and right wrist disabilities in a March 2015 rating decision, noting that he also disagreed with the zero percent ratings assigned for these disabilities.  The March 2015 rating decision did not assign ratings as the AOJ in that decision denied service connection for right elbow, right knee, and right wrist disabilities.  Furthermore, the August 2024 notice of disagreement on VA Form 10182 cannot be accepted as a timely notice of disagreement with the March 2015 rating decision, which was issued under the legacy system.  Thus, the issues of service connection for right elbow, right knee, and right wrist disabilities, are not currently before the Board. 

Lastly, while the Veteran in the August 2024 notice of disagreement indicated that he was appealing the rating decision dated on January 4, 2024, the procedural history clearly shows that he was appealing the rating decision dated on January 3, 2024. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  This may be accomplished by affirmatively showing inception or aggravation during service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a).  Service connection may also be granted for disability shown after service, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, shows that it was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

For the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time, as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word "chronic."  Continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required where the condition noted during service is not, in fact, shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (b); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

For a Veteran who served 90 days or more of active service after December 31, 1946, there is a presumption of service connection for hypertension if the disability is manifest to a compensable degree within one year of discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).  Thus, hypertension is included among the chronic diseases under 38 U.S.C. § 1101 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (a).

To grant service connection under any theory of entitlement, there must be a current disability.  Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  Absent a diagnosis, a symptom significant enough to result in functional impairment in earning capacity qualifies as a disability.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (concerning the symptom of pain).  A disability is current if present near or at the time a claim is filed or at any time during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

For VA compensation purposes, the term "hypertension" means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 mm. or greater, or systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101 n.1.  A diagnosis of hypertension "must be confirmed by readings two or more times on at least three different days."  Id.   The requirement of multiple blood pressure readings to be taken over multiple days as specified in Note (1) of DC 7101 applies to confirming the existence of hypertension.  Gill v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 386, 391 (2013).  

The Veteran contends that he has high blood pressure due to service.  See September 2023 claim.  

Service treatment records shows that the Veteran had blood pressure readings of 116/80 in September 1993; 142/70 in April 1995, 134/67, in March 1996; 110/76 in January 1997; 116/80 in an undated record, and 120/80 on the January 1997 examination upon separation from service.  

After service, VA treatment records in June 2022 show a blood pressure reading of 147/91 with an assessment of elevated blood pressure without hypertension.  VA treatment records in June 2022 show a blood pressure reading of 132/84; and blood pressure machine recorded readings ranged from 147/88, 142/89 to 154/99 and 156/93.  The examiner noted that blood pressure was 151/92 with the machine and 132/84 manually.  The examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of hypertension.  However, private medical records in October 2022 show a history of hypertension and indicated a date of onset in August 2021.  Thus, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Veteran the Board will assume that the Veteran has a disability diagnosed as hypertension.  

As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report symptoms pertaining to his hypertension that are within the realm of one's personal knowledge and personal knowledge which comes through the use of senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994).  To the extent that the Veteran is contending continuity of symptomatology since service, such assertion would not be credible as the Veteran on the January 1997 report of medical history upon separation from service denied having high blood pressure.

Further, although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), as to the specific issues in this case, the etiology of hypertension falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  This is not the type of disorder that is readily amenable to mere lay diagnosis or probative comment regarding its etiology.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Veteran has not been shown to possess the requisite medical training, expertise, or credentials needed to render a diagnosis or a competent opinion as to medical causation.  Nothing in the record demonstrates that the Veteran received any special training or acquired any medical expertise in evaluating such disorder.  Accordingly, the lay evidence does not constitute competent medical evidence and lacks probative value.  As the lay evidence is not competent, the matter of whether it is credible is not reached.

VA has an obligation to provide VA examinations for any service connection claim which cannot be presumptively granted where there is evidence of Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA), unless the Secretary determines that there is no indication of an association between the claimed disability and TERA.  See VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act (Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022), 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).  In the instant case at the time of the January 2024 rating decision a memorandum dated on November 27, 2023, confirmed that during service the Veteran did not participate in TERA.  Thus, there was no duty to assist error in not providing a TERA examination. 

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has not been provided a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his hypertension.  The evidence does not establish an in-service incurrence or continuous symptoms since service.  Therefore, it is insufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist by providing a medical opinion regarding service connection.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006); see also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

Thus, for the above reasons the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the claim of service connection for hypertension must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).
