DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) of the neck is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity neuropathy is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least in approximate equipoise as to whether the Veteran's IVDS of the neck is related to an in-service injury.

2. The evidence is at least in approximate equipoise as to whether the Veteran's left upper extremity neuropathy is related to an in-service injury.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the award of service connection for IVDS of the neck have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. The criteria for the award of service connection for left upper extremity neuropathy have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1996 to September 2002.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of service connection for a neck disability and right and left upper extremity neuropathy disabilities, most recently addressed in a September 2020 rating decision. In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claims for IVDS of the neck, right upper extremity neuropathy, and left upper extremity neuropathy, based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket for the issues listed above, as well as the issue of service connection for a right upper extremity disability. However, in March 2024, the Veteran submitted another VA Form 10182, including the issues of neck and left upper extremity disabilities (but not a right upper extremity disability), electing the Direct Review option. An appellant may request to switch dockets under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by completing a new VA Form 10182. The new VA Form 10182 must be received at the Board within one year from the date of notice of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). 

Therefore, the Board sent the Veteran a letter on April 1, 2025, granting a docket switch for the issues of IVDS of the neck and left upper extremity neuropathy, placing those issues on the Direct Review docket, as requested in the March 2024 VA Form 10182. The issue of service connection for right upper extremity neuropathy remains on the Evidence Submission docket originally selected on the November 27, 2023, VA Form 10182. As such, the issue of service connection for right upper extremity neuropathy will be addressed in a separate Board decision.

Turning to the instant issues, the Veteran asserts that the conditions are due to a motor vehicle accident in service, and that both conditions have existed since that time.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). 

In the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has diagnoses of IVDS of the neck and left upper extremity neuropathy. The AOJ made further favorable findings that the evidence shows a qualifying event in service-namely, a complaint of neck pain following a 2001 motor vehicle accident and complaints of arm pain in service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings.

Therefore, the key question at issue is whether there is a nexus, or link, between the Veteran's current disabilities and the in-service events.

In support of her claim, the Veteran has explained that she has experienced neck and related upper extremity neuropathy symptoms since a motor vehicle accident during active duty. Service records show a diagnosis of neck sprain in February 2001. Indeed, she initially filed a claim of service connection for a neck and upper extremity disability in January 2007; at a July 2007 VA examination, she reported pain in her neck and shoulders. She told a private provider in October 2017 that she experienced an injury during her service and that her pain radiated to her neck and shoulders. In August 2020 and July 2023 statements, the Veteran reported that her cervical strain was related to the car accident in service. In June 2023, she told a private provider from whom she was seeking treatment for her neck, that she had a long history of neck pain, which had recently worsened causing severe sharp pain in her neck and shoulders.

The Veteran underwent VA examinations for her neck and upper extremity neuropathy in October 2023. Notably, the examiner noted diagnoses of IVDS and cervical neuropathy in 2001. The Veteran reported that both conditions onset after her motor vehicle accident in service. Despite putting in the examination report that both diagnoses stem from 2001, the examiner opined that neither condition was related to service; rather, the examiner stated that the conditions began in June 2023 when the Veteran reported neck pain to a medical provider. 

For several reasons, the Board affords the October 2023 opinions no probative value. As noted above, the examiner noted diagnoses of both conditions from 2001 but then in the nexus opinions, stated that both conditions stemmed from a 2023 injury. Moreover, the examiner only considered private medical evidence from June 2023 showing neck treatment, with no consideration at all of any treatment for neck and upper extremity issues prior to that date. As noted earlier, there is significant documentation in the claims file of complaints of and treatment for neck and associated upper extremity issues during and since service.

Although the Board is not satisfied with the aforementioned medical opinion, it believes that another remand to obtain an additional opinion would be an exercise in futility. Given the Veteran's diagnoses, her credible lay statements, the in-service motor vehicle accident, and documentation of treatment for neck and upper extremity issues on a consistent basis since service, the Board finds the evidence for and against the claims to be in approximate equipoise. Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the current IVDS of the neck and left upper extremity neuropathy are at least as likely as not related to her active service. The benefits sought on appeal are accordingly granted.
