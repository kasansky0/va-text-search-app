ORDER

Entitlement to an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for amputation of the left ring finger is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has experienced amputation of his entire left ring finger at the metacarpophalangeal joint.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an evaluation of 20 percent, but no higher, for amputation of the left ring finger have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.40, 4.45, 4.71a, Diagnostic Codes 5155.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1967 to March 1973.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

The Veteran requested higher level review in February 2024, and the AOJ issued a responsive rating decision in June 2024.

The Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 in September 2024, electing the hearing Board review option.  A Board hearing was held in January 2025.  A transcript is of record.

The Veteran seeks a higher evaluation for left ring finger amputation.  He experienced an injury during service that resulted in the amputation of that digit.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings based on average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Percentage evaluations are determined by comparing the manifestations of a particular disorder with the requirements contained in the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can practically be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such disease or injury and their residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  VA has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations which are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record, and to explain the reasons and bases for its conclusion.   

If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the Veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance.  Functional loss may be due to the absence or deformity of structures or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior in undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.

With respect to joints, in particular, the factors of disability reside in reductions of normal excursion of movements in different planes.  Inquiry will be directed to more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45.

The disability in question is evaluated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5155 for amputation of the ring finger.  A 20 percent evaluation is warranted where there is metacarpal resection (more than one half of the bone lost), for either the major or minor hand.  

Here, a VA examiner clarified in February 2024 that the Veteran had experienced amputation of the entire left ring finger digit at the metacarpophalangeal joint.  Thus, he is entitled to a 20 percent evaluation.  The Board notes that this is the maximum evaluation for amputation of the ring finger; as such, a higher evaluation is not for application.
