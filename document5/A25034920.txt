DOCKET NO. 241002-480060
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran is service connected for a lumbar spine disability and the evidence probatively establishes that the Veteran's left and right lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy are caused by the Veteran's service-connected lumbar spine disability. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1979 to August 1982.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Board of Veterans' Appeals' (Board) Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review (HLR) in an October 2023 HLR rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the September 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR, the Board has not considered it in this decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  In a November 2023 AOJ rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to service connection for lumbar degenerative disc disease with degenerative arthritis, effective May 15, 2022.  As this is a binding adjudicative determination, and not evidence, it can be considered in this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  

If the Veteran would like the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his attorney has raised any issues with VA's duty to notify or VA's duty to assist during the period prior to the issuance of the September 2022 AOJ rating decision.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board...to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); see also Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  Thus, the Board need not discuss any potential issues in this regard.

More than 60 days has passed since the receipt of the October 2024 VA Form 10182, and more than one year has passed since the mailing of the October 2023 HLR rating decision.  As such, a Board docket switch under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) is legally precluded, and the Board may proceed with its appellate consideration.  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 310-11 (2024).  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 7104, Board decisions must be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation.  The law requires only that the Board address its reasons for rejecting evidence favorable to the Veteran.  Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-29 (2000).  The Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence.  Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence within the period on review and on what this evidence shows, or fails to show, on the claims.  The Veteran must not assume that the Board has overlooked pieces of evidence that are not explicitly discussed herein.  See Timberlake, supra.

1. Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity radiculopathy is granted.

Service connection will be granted if it is shown that a veteran has a disability resulting from an injury or disease contracted in the line of duty, or for aggravation of a preexisting injury or disease contracted in the line of duty, in the active military, naval, air, or space service.  38?U.S.C. §?1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.

Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  All elements must be satisfied before service connection may be achieved.  

Additionally, service connection may be achieved if any applicable presumptive service connection regulations apply to the Veteran's circumstances or when a claimed disability is shown to be proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy, to include as secondary to his service-connected lumbar spine disability under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  See May 2022 lay statement. 

The Veteran attended a VA back examination in June 2022, where a diagnosis of radiculopathy of the lower extremities was rendered.  The Veteran was assessed with left and right lower extremity radiculopathy impacting the sciatic nerve roots at L4/L5/S1/S2/S3.  In accompanying medical nexus opinions, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was not etiologically related to his active duty service; however, the examiner highlighted a November 2017 VA treatment record, which explained that the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity pain was likely radiculopathy secondary to his lumbar spinal stenosis. 

In the September 2022 rating decision, the AOJ issued favorable findings concluding that (1) the Veteran had current diagnoses of left and right lower extremity radiculopathy and (2) the June 2022 VA examination indicated that the Veteran's radiculopathy was a result of his currently diagnosed back disability.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings, absent clear and unmistakable error, which is not present.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The AOJ denied the claims on a secondary basis because at the time of the September 2022 rating decision, the Veteran was not service connected for a lumbar spine disability.  Since then, the Veteran has been awarded entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability in a November 2023 rating decision, which is binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  Given this change in circumstances, secondary service connection is now authorized, as the evidence probatively establishes that the Veteran's current left and right lower extremity radiculopathy were caused by the Veteran's now service-connected lumbar spine disability.  The requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 have been satisfied and the claims may be granted on a secondary service connection basis.  Accordingly, the Veteran's appeals seeking entitlement to service connection for left and right lower extremity radiculopathy are granted.  

In the October 2024 appellate brief, the Veteran's attorney provided argument regarding the proper effective date and rating to be assigned for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  These are downstream issues to be decided by the AOJ in the first instance upon implementation of the Board's grant of service connection and are not relevant to the current appeals.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  If the Veteran has any disagreement with the effective date or ratings assigned in the implementing AOJ rating decision, he is free to pursue any of the agency review options set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, as appropriate.
