ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for hearing loss is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (claimed as vertigo) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus had onset in service.

2. The Veteran does not have a hearing loss disability in either ear for VA purposes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1154(b), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310

2. The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1967 to December 1968.  

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2023 and May 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on November 22, 2024.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim for bilateral hearing loss, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for vertigo, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires competent evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  

VA has also established certain rules and presumptions for chronic diseases, such as tinnitus. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). With chronic diseases shown as such in service so as to permit a finding of service connection, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  If chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, chronic diseases are presumed to have been incurred in service if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a).

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. ?38?U.S.C. §?5107;?38?C.F.R. §?3.102.  If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied.  Lynch?v. McDonough,?999 F.3d 1391 (2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran asserts that he has tinnitus due to his service. Specifically, he reported that he was exposed to constant noise, including thumping from diesel engines,  during service while working aboard submarines. See November 2024 Hearing Transcript, p. 4-5.

The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus and that his military occupational specialty (MOS) of torpedoman shows hazardous noise exposure in service. See August 2023 Rating Decision-Narrative. It has also conceded participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) and found that the Veteran's MOS has a probability of exposure to asbestos. See id. 

The Board finds that the evidence of record addressing whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service is at least in approximate balance. In this regard, the Veteran testified at the hearing in November 2024 and stated that his tinnitus started in service and continued to the present day.  Notably, tinnitus is a disability that is capable of lay observation and does not require medical expertise to determine its presence or its relationship, if any, to prior events. Thus, the Veteran is competent to speak to the presence of his tinnitus. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2014). Likewise, he is competent to speak to its origins and provide a link to his service. 

While VA examiners issued negative opinions in July 2023 and August 2023, the Board finds these opinions inadequate. The July 2023 examiner appeared to rely on the absence of medical records and the time between separation and post service complaint (see July 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)); and the August 2023 VA examiner appeared to rely on a finding that medical and scientific literature did not demonstrate a definitive causal relationship between the Veteran's tinnitus and his toxic exposure risk activities. See August 2023 DBQ. 

The Board notes that the absence of medical records during or after service cannot be the sole basis for an opinion against a claim. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Further, while evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint and the amount of time that elapsed since service can be considered, the July 2023 examiner failed to provide a reasoned medical explanation as to the significance of the length of time between separation and the complaints documented in the post-service medical records. Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Finally, the Court has held that nexus opinions premised on the absence of general medical literature without discussing the specific facts of the case are inadequate. See Bailey v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 54, 60 (2018). Here, the August 2023 examiner's rationale premised on the absence of general medical and scientific literature supporting a nexus without discussing the specific facts of this Veteran's case.

As discussed above, tinnitus does not require medical expertise to determine its presence, and the July 2023 and August 2023 examiners did not account for the Veteran's competent report of its onset in service and continuation thereafter. See November 2024 Hearing Transcript, p. 3-7. (documenting the Veteran's report that his tinnitus onset during service and has continued since then). 

In any event, given the Veteran's competent and credible report that he has tinnitus that began in service in connection with his conceded hazardous noise exposure that has continued since then; and resolving all reasonable doubt in his favor, the criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. The claim is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran asserts that his bilateral hearing loss is due to his service. See November 2024 Hearing Testimony, p. 3-6. As discussed above, the AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran's MOS shows hazardous noise exposure in service; it has conceded participation in TERA; and found that the Veteran's MOS has a probability of exposure to asbestos. See August 2023 Rating Decision-Narrative. The Board is bound by these findings and finds no clear and unmistakable error to rebut them. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

A cornerstone of service connection is a current disability (either a probative diagnosis or symptoms which reach the level of functional impairment of earning capacity). See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992). However, regarding hearing loss, specifically, for the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered a ratable disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of those frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Veteran was afforded a VA hearing loss examination in July 2023. The relevant pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

July 2023	HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000	CNC

RIGHT	20	20	15	25	20	100%

LEFT	20	20	20	20	25	96%

The Veteran's speech recognition ability was 100 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left ear using the Maryland CNC speech recognition test. See July 2023 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus DBQ.

Based on the foregoing, because the Veteran does not have a threshold of 40 decibels or greater at any relevant Hertz, or at least three thresholds having a decibel of 26 decibels or greater, or a speech recognition score of less than 94 percent for either ear at any time during the pendency of his claim or shortly prior to the filing of his claim, he does not meet the criteria for a VA disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385; Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).

Moreover, there are no other VA records and no private clinical records during the pendency of the claim or shortly prior to the filing of the claim which support that the Veteran has a hearing loss disability for VA purposes. In that regard, although the Veteran has submitted a private medical record of Dr. D.L., she did not diagnose the Veteran with hearing loss for VA purposes. Dr. D.L. found that the Veteran had noise exposure on submarines while in the military. She opined that the Veteran suffered from bilateral hearing loss, with a mild sloping sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and a mild sloping to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear, based on an audiogram. She noted that the Veteran stated that he notices he has hearing loss because he always asks to have people repeat themselves. See November 19, 2024 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. Review of this private treatment record does not establish hearing loss for VA purposes. It appears Dr. D.L.'s diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss, sensorineural, was based upon an audiogram that was not submitted within the 90-day evidentiary window following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a).

The Board expressly acknowledges its consideration of the lay evidence of record, including that submitted by the Veteran with medical experience and training, including his report that he is diagnosed with and affected by hearing loss; that he was exposed to constant noise from diesel engines when at sea and while standing oiler watches in the forward engine room; that while the submarine was submerged, he would be experience pain in the inner ear at times when waves hit the solenoid, creating a vacuum within the pressure hull exerting pressure upon his ears; and that during pressure training at sub school the Veteran sustained bloody trauma to the left ear drum. See November 2024 Correspondence.

The Veteran is competent to testify that he has difficulty with hearing acuity, but his statements are not sufficient to establish a hearing loss disability for VA purposes because he has not been shown to have the training necessary to make audiometric determinations pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Overall, the Board finds the July 2023 VA examination report to be the most probative evidence of record as to the issue of whether the Veteran has hearing loss for VA purposes. In this regard, as noted, this examination report contained the only valid audiometric test results of record during the appeal period and such results did not show hearing loss disability for VA purposes pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

As a final matter, the Board acknowledges that the July 2023 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss; however, the Veteran's hearing loss did not meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

In short, the most probative - and therefore most persuasive, evidence is against, not instead in approximate (nearly equal) balance, finding that the Veteran has a current hearing loss disability in either ear for VA purposes. Thus, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). 

If the Veteran believes his current hearing loss has continued to worsen, he is invited to file a supplemental claim with the AOJ. For purposes of this appeal, however, service connection for bilateral hearing loss must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (claimed as vertigo) is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his vertigo. Specifically, he asserts that he experienced vertigo the first time he went to sea, for most of the time he was at sea, and upon returning to the dock. See November 2024 Hearing Transcript, p. 6-7. The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and has conceded that the Veteran has participated in TERA with probable asbestos exposure. See May 2024 Rating Decision-Narrative. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in March 2024. The examiner found that the Veteran's vertigo was a diagnosable chronic multi-symptom illness with a partially explained etiology. She concluded that the Veteran's vertigo was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner's rationale included, "STR review is significant for: Enlistment Exam 1966: Silent; Separation Exam 1968: Silent; Report of Health 1971: + seasickness and ear issues," and "[f]ollowing separation records are silent until 2023."  See March 2024 DBQ,

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. Here, the AOJ obtained a medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal; however, the medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (once VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination when developing a service connection claim, even if not statutorily obligated to do so, it must provide one that is adequate for purposes of the determination being made). In that regard, the March 2024 VA examiner appears to rely solely on the absence of medical records and the amount of time between separation and the current vertigo complaints. 

As noted above, the absence of medical records cannot be the sole basis of an opinion against a claim, and while evidence of a prolonged period without medical complaint and the amount of time that elapsed since service can be considered, the examiner failed to provide a reasoned medical explanation as to the significance of the length of time between separation and the complaints documented in the post-service medical records. Buchanan 451 F.3d at 1331; Maxson, 230 F.3d at 1333. Moreover, it appears the examiner did not appropriately consider the Veteran's in-service ear treatment and post-service reports of vertigo symptoms. In short, there are no medical principles or explanations that allow the Board to understand how the examiner came to her conclusion. As such, the Board finds the VA medical opinion is not supported with an adequate rationale.   

Further, the Veteran asserts that his vertigo is the result of his service aboard submarines to include due to ear pressure from submersion, therefore a VA clinical opinion addressing direct service connection should have been obtained prior to issuance of the decision on appeal. 

The Board acknowledges the November 2024 medical opinion by L.M., M.D.  Dr. L.M. noted that the Veteran has been diagnosed with vertigo.  He also indicated that this condition existed in the military.  However, Dr. L.M. did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's current disability is related to service.  Accordingly, the Board is unable to grant this claim based on Dr. L.M.'s November 2024 opinion.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007)

For the foregoing reasons, an additional opinion should have been obtained, and this pre-decisional error must be corrected on remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Send the claims file to an appropriate clinician to obtain an addendum medical opinion. If a new examination is deemed necessary to respond to the question posed, one should be scheduled. The clinician should answer the following question:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's current vertigo disability was either incurred in service or is otherwise related to any event, illness, or injury that occurred during service? Please explain why or why not.

(Continued on the next page)

?

The examiner should consider and discuss 1) the ear treatment/complaint documented in the Veteran's STRs; and 2) the Veteran's lay statements of record.   

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions given. The rationale cannot solely rely on the length of time between conclusion of the Veteran's service and the earliest post-service documentation of a vertigo disability to form the basis of a negative opinion. If the examiner is unable to provide an opinion without resorting to mere speculation, they should clearly explain why this is so.
