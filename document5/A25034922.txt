ORDER

Entitlement to retroactive induction into/reimbursement for a Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program under Chapter 31, Title 38, United States Code, is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was found entitled to VR&E benefits with a serious employment handicap in October 2021.

2. The Veteran meets all the criteria required for retroactive induction into the VR&E program.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to VR&E benefits, to include for purposes of retroactive payment for education expenses, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3100, 3102; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.40, 21.50, 21.282.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1990 to August 1993, from January 2002 to December 2002, and from January 2003 to September 2003, to include service in Kuwait.  He also had service in the U.S. Army Reserve.  His decorations include the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Air Assault Badge. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 decision issued by the VR&E Division of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by filing a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in June 2023, requesting direct review of the evidence considered by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(1).

Under the direct review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after that decision was promulgated.

Entitlement to retroactive induction into/reimbursement for a VR&E program.

The Veteran is seeking retroactive induction into a VR&E program for purposes of reimbursement of past educational expenses.  

The provisions of Chapter 31 are intended to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment.  The purpose of such services is to provide a level of training that facilitates suitable employment.  38 U.S.C. § 3100; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.1, 21.70.

An individual may be inducted into a rehabilitation program on a retroactive basis.  If the individual is retroactively inducted, VA may authorize payment pursuant to § 21.262 or § 21.264 for tuition, fees, and other verifiable expenses that an individual paid or incurred consistent with the approved rehabilitation program.  In addition, VA may authorize payment of a subsistence allowance pursuant to §§ 21.260, 21.266, and 21.270 for the period of retroactive induction, except for any period during which the individual was on active duty.

In accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 21.282, a program of rehabilitation and assistance may be approved retroactively when all the following conditions are met:

(1) The past period is within - (i) A period under § 21.40(c) during which a servicemember was awaiting discharge for disability; or (ii) A period of eligibility under §§ 21.41 through 21.44 or 38 U.S.C. § 3103.

(2) The individual was entitled to disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 11 during the period or would likely have been entitled to that compensation but for active-duty service.

(3) The individual met the criteria for entitlement to vocational rehabilitation benefits and services under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 in effect during the period.

(4) VA determines that the individual's training and other rehabilitation services received during the period were reasonably needed to achieve the goals and objectives identified for the individual and may be included in the plan developed for the individual (see 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.80 through 21.88, and §§ 21.92 through 21.96).

(5) VA has recouped any benefits that it paid the individual for education or training pursued under any VA education program during any portion of the period.

(6) An initial evaluation was completed under 38 C.F.R. § 21.50.

(7) A period of extended evaluation is not needed to be able to determine the reasonable feasibility of the achievement of a vocational goal.

See 38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c).  The effective date for retroactive induction is the date when all of the entitlement conditions are met.  38 C.F.R. § 21.282(d).

The criteria (and limitations) pertaining to retroactive induction are also addressed in VA's updated VR&E policy manual, the M28C, which replaced the M28R in 2020.  Prior to the implementation of the M28C, a veteran who used Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) benefits to pay for education or training expenses could be retroactively reimbursed for the difference between the benefits that he or she received under Chapter 33 and what he or she would have received under Chapter 31 for that same period, if the Veteran had been previously determined eligible and entitled to Chapter 31 benefits for that period. This concept was known as "retroactive reimbursement."  However, effective April 1, 2021, retroactive reimbursement is no longer available for use.  Rather, where a Veteran self-paid for his or her previous education or training expenses or completed the previous education or training program under Chapter 33, the Veteran may be reimbursed for the associated expenses if he or she meets the criteria for retroactive induction under 38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c).  See M28C, Part V, Section B, Chapter 6 (noting "retroactive induction for a period previously completed under Chapter 33 does not require the recoupment of VA benefits that were previously paid in order to process Chapter 31 benefits for the approved retroactive time period."). 

By way of background, the Veteran applied for VR&E services in August 2021.  At that time, he was service connected for multiple disabilities with a combined evaluation of 0 (zero) percent disabling from August 2, 1993, and 70 percent from July 31, 2018.  He was subsequently evaluated by a vocational rehabilitation counselor (VRC) and found to have a serious employment handicap for VR&E purposes.  See October 2021 VA Form 28-1902b (Counseling Record - Narrative Report). 

In January 2022, the Veteran signed an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) with the stated goal of finding employment in the area of teaching counseling at the college level.  The objectives included completing a counseling education and supervision courses.  The VR&E program would provide academic instruction, tuition, fees, books, supplies, and subsistence allowance.

The record shows that the Veteran began attending the University of the Cumberlands in May 2021 in pursuit of a Doctor of Philosophy in Counselor Education and Supervision.  

A March 2023 letter reflects that the Veteran was informed that his case might benefit from retroactive induction consideration.  Specifically, the letter and its attachments informed the Veteran that retroactive induction might include moving entitlement used in Chapter 33 to Chapter 31 for the approved retroactive period and reimbursement for the difference in benefits, such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, and monthly allowance that he would have received during the retroactive period had he been using Chapter 31 instead of Chapter 33.   

In May 2023, the Veteran returned the forms requesting movement of entitlement for the approved retroactive induction for a period previously used under Chapter 33; reimbursement for the difference in tuition and fees; reimbursement for the differences in books and supplies; and reimbursement for the difference in monthly housing allowance.  

Later, in May 2023, the VRC denied the Veteran's request for retroactive induction or reimbursement on the basis that he did not have a compensable disability rating until after the completion of his training under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  In that regard, the VRC noted that the Veteran's last term under Chapter 33 was from January 8, 2018 to April 21, 2018 and he had had no further training under Chapter 33 since that time.  The VRC noted, furthermore, that the Veteran was notified in October 2019 that he was granted a combined disability rating of 70 percent, effective July 31, 2018, after his period of training under Chapter 33.  

The Board notes that the VRC approved the request for retroactive induction for the out-of-pocket expenses the Veteran paid while pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of the Cumberlands from May 2021 to December 2021.  See July 2023 VR-64 (Chapter 31 Positive Decision Letter).  

In this case, the Board must consider whether the Veteran is entitled to retroactive induction to a VR&E program for the reimbursement of expenses incurred under Chapter 33.

Initially, the Veteran's education file reflects that, between August 2013 and April 2018, he used the Post-9/11 GI Bill to pursue a Diploma in Education (D.Ed), school counseling certification, and trauma studies certification.

During the past period, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran's initial twelve-year basic period of eligibility expired in 2014.  38 C.F.R. § 21.41.  However, the Veteran has been determined to have a serious employment handicap and is therefore eligible for an extension of the basic period of eligibility.  38 C.F.R. § 21.44; 38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c)(1)(ii).  Resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the first criterion for retroactive induction has been satisfied.

The Veteran was also entitled to disability compensation under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 11 during the period in question.  38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c)(2).  The second criteria for retroactive induction are also satisfied.  Id.  

Additionally, an initial evaluation was completed in October 2021 and the Veteran was determined to have a serious employment handicap and to be entitled to VR&E benefits at that time.  At no time during the period on appeal did the VRC find it necessary to provide the Veteran with an extended evaluation to assess the feasibility of his vocational goal.  The Board therefore finds that the third, fifth, sixth, and seventh criteria for retroactive induction were met.  38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c).

Finally, the Board finds that fourth criterion for retroactive induction has been met.  Condition (4) is satisfied when "VA determines that the individual's training received during the appeal period [was] reasonably needed to achieve the goals and objectives for the individual."  In this case, the Veteran was seeking to utilize the VR&E program to obtain employment as a college-level teacher.  His IWRP included completing a counseling education and supervision courses.  Clearly, completion of a lower-level degree (such as a D.Ed and certifications) would, at minimum, be required prior to entry into a doctoral program as the Veteran was enrolled in at the time of the decision on appeal.  Stated another way, the record reflects that the courses pursued with the Post-9/11 GI Bill had a measurable impact on the doctoral program at the University of the Cumberlands.  The evidence clearly demonstrates that the "reasonably needed" requirement has been met in this case.  38 C.F.R. § 21.282(c)(4).

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise that all seven criteria for retroactive induction have been met.  The evidence, at a minimum, gives rise to a reasonable doubt on the matter.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).  The appeal is granted.
