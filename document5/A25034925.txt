DOCKET NO. 240830-470402
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence of record establishes that his tinnitus is due to his noise exposure in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1996 to July 2004.

This appeal is being processed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017.  115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  The Veteran timely initiated an appeal by submitting an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), and elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time the AOJ issued the October 2023 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the October 2023 rating decision on appeal has not been considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Ordinarily a lay person is?competent?to report symptoms and experiences observable?by their senses; however, a lay person is?usually?not competent?to prove a matter requiring medical expertise.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372, 1377?(Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown,?6 Vet. App. 465, 470?(1994).

The determination of whether the requirements of service connection have been met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  See Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999). When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each issue shall be given to the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Thus, a claimant need only demonstrate an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in order to prevail.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

The issue of service connection for bilateral tinnitus.

The Veteran contends his tinnitus is due to his military service.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits; December 2022 VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim.

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made the following favorable findings: (1) the Veteran has a diagnosed disability of tinnitus; (2) the Veteran had in-service noise exposure as evidenced by his military occupational specialty (Multi-Channel Transmission System Operator-Maintainer); and (3) the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) evidenced by his deployment to Kuwait from March 2003 to June 2003.

The only remaining issue is whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his exposure to noise during his military service.

In May 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  In the examination and medical opinion, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not the result of military noise exposure.  The opinion relied on the lack of threshold shifts in hearing during military service and therefore a lack of objective evidence of auditory damage.  The opinion further relied on the lack of complaint in service for the condition and records during and after service in which tinnitus was denied.  The examiner therefore found no evidence to support a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his military service.

The May 2023 examiner also provided medical opinions for the Veteran's left and right ear tinnitus based on the Veteran's conceded TERA participation.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by his TERA participation, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effectives of all TERAs.  The examiner also reiterated their finding above as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by his noise exposure in service. 

In October 2023, additional VA TERA medical opinions were obtained from another examiner, which included consideration of exposure to depleted uranium.  This examiner also concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by his TERA participation, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effectives of all TERAs.  The examiner also echoed the findings of the May 2023 examiner as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by his noise exposure in service.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion.  August 2023 Medical Opinion of A.M., DNP.  The private medical opinion concluded that the Veteran's bilateral tinnitus is at least as likely as not due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active-duty military service.  The opinion relied on current medical literature regarding tinnitus and the relation to hearing thresholds, noting that tinnitus may be caused by cochlear neuropathy, not just cochlear damage, and therefore tinnitus may present even with a normal audiogram.  The opinion concluded that the Veteran's tinnitus was more likely than not due to prior acoustic trauma during military service that led to cochlear deterioration and damage that resulted in tinnitus without typical hearing loss.

The Board notes the examiners provided rationales for the conclusions reached; therefore, the Board finds that the opinions are entitled to equal weight.  While there are more negative opinions than positive, all of the negative opinions rely on the same evidence for the conclusion reached.  As such, the evidence regarding a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his in-service noise exposure is approximately balanced.  The benefit of the doubt is afforded to the Veteran; and accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.
