REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from September 1964 to September 1988. 

In February 2023, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) granted service connection for left knee total knee replacement residuals.  In February 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction implemented the Board decision and assigned an effective date of June 14, 2016, for the award of service connection for left knee total knee replacement residuals.  In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, VA Form 20-0995.  In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996.  In December 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction issued a higher level review rating decision indicating a difference of opinion had been asserted.  In March 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction awarded a 50 percent rating for PTSD, effective October 31, 2023; denied a rating in excess of 30 percent for the service-connected left knee total knee replacement residuals; and denied entitlement to a TDIU.  In March 2024 the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, VA Form 20-0996, as to the issues of a rating in excess of 30 percent for the left knee total knee replacement residuals and entitlement to a TDIU.  In April 2024, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction increased the rating for left knee total knee replacement residuals from 30 percent to 60 percent, effective January 11, 2024, and denied entitlement to a TDIU.  On April 3, 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, as to the issues of earlier effective dates for the awards of both the 60 percent rating for the left knee total knee replacement residuals and the 50 percent rating for PTSD and the denial of a TDIU and elected the Direct Review docket.  In July 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notified the Veteran of his right to select a different Board review within one year of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal.  The Veteran did not respond to the July 2024 notice.  

Withdrawal

In a March 2025 written statement, the Veteran requested the Board to "[p]lease withdraw the 4/3/2024 Board appeal."  

A veteran may withdraw a substantive appeal in writing at any time prior to the Board's promulgation of a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  A written withdrawal of any appeal is effective when received by the Board and will be deemed a withdrawal of the notice of disagreement as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b), (c); Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020).

The Board finds that the Veteran has effectively withdrawn the appeal for an effective date prior to January 11, 2024, for the award of a 60 percent rating for left knee total knee replacement residuals; an effective date prior to October 31, 2023, for the award of a 50 percent rating for PTSD; and entitlement to a TDIU.  Therefore, the Board concludes that no allegation of fact or law remains as to these issues, and the appeal must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.

In his March 2025 written statement the Veteran requested the Board to consider "the March 2025 Board appeal because it corrects rating decision date errors."  A March 2025 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, has not been docketed by the Board and is therefore neither presently before the Board nor within the present appeal.
