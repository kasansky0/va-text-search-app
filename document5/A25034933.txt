ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating (greater than 0 percent) for dermatitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's dermatitis covered greater than 5 percent of his exposed area or total body area during the appeal period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable disability rating for dermatitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7806.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1992 to June 1996.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

The Veteran elected the Board's Direct Review docket. See May 2024 VA Form 10182. This restricts the Board's review to the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that evidence was associated with the claims file after the November 2023 rating decision on appeal, which was during a period of time that is outside the applicable evidentiary window. Therefore, the Board has not considered this evidence in its present decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300(a). 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the Veteran's symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R., Part 4. The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability. Id. The basis of disability ratings is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body, to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. "Staged ratings" are, however, appropriate for an increased rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The evaluation of the same disability under several diagnostic codes, known as "pyramiding," must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. However, separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury, so long as the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative of or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Id.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Veteran will receive the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating (greater than 0 percent) for dermatitis is denied.

The period on appeal is from December 2, 2022 (the day VA received the Veteran's intent to file) to the November 2023 rating decision on appeal. 

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to a 10 percent rating for his service-connected dermatitis. See May 2024 Third Party Correspondence. His "eczema" covers his buttocks and head. As noted in a private medical opinion, the lay statements support finding the condition involves at least 5 percent but no greater than 20 percent of his entire body area. See also September 2023 Medical Treatment Record.

A March 2023 rating decision awarded service connection for a rash (unspecified) and assigned a noncompensable rating under DC 7806 with an effective date of December 2, 2022. 38 C.F.R. § 3.118. The November 2023 rating decision changed the diagnosis to dermatitis (not otherwise specified) and continued the noncompensable rating.

In general, DC 7806 (dermatitis or eczema) directs the factfinder to the General Rating Formula for the Skin. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Under the General Rating Formula, a noncompensable rating is assigned if the veteran has required no more than topical therapy over the past 12-months period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected, or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. 

A 10 percent rating is assigned if one of the following is present: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body or exposed areas affected; or required intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. Id.

A 30 percent rating is assigned if the characteristic lesions involve at least 20 percent, but no greater than 40 percent, of the entire body or exposed areas affected; or required systemic therapy or other immunosuppressive drugs for at least 6 weeks in total (constant use is not required), over the past 12-month period. Id.

A 60 percent (maximum) rating is assigned if the characteristic lesions involve more than 40 percent of the entire body or exposed areas; or required constant or near-constant systemic therapy or other immunosuppressive drugs over the past 12-month period. Id.

The Board recognizes that Part 4 does not define "exposed area" and takes judicial notice that the VA Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) defines exposed area as the face, neck, and hands. See M21-1, Part V.iii.10.1.g.

The Board also notes that the General Rating Formula for the Skin was revised effective August 13, 2018.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  As the Veteran's claim was filed after August 13, 2018, only the new criteria apply to this claim.

The VA treatment records contain no diagnosis related to dermatitis, a rash, or similar condition. It contains only the Veteran's vague report of "skin problem" during a June 2022 telephone registry for an initial evaluation related to airborne hazards and burn pit exposures. See March 2023 CAPRI. The registry note provided no additional details regarding the statement. A list of his then-current history of medical conditions included no skin-related diagnosis. The review of the skin systems consistently show he denied skin-related issues, including "rash, ulcerations, changes in moles." See generally CAPRI. The clinical examinations documented no observable rashes, skin lesions, or ulcerations.

The Veteran was afforded a VA skin diseases examination in January 2023. See February 2023 C&P Exam. The diagnosis was rash, unspecified (January 2023). He reported an onset of a rash on his right buttock in 2001 that had progressively worsened. Treatment consisted of hydrocortisone and Benadryl creams. The examiner noted that there were no visible characteristic lesions at the time of the examination. Noting "scaly patch" associated with the right buttock, the examiner opined that the rash covered no more than 5 percent of the Veteran's total body and exposed areas.

The Veteran was afforded a second VA skin diseases examination in November 2023. The diagnosis was dermatitis, not otherwise specified (2023). He reported waking up with dry, scaly patches on his back, hips, and scalp in 1998 and that the condition has stayed the same. His treatment consisted of Benadryl and an unidentified topical cream. The examiner noted that there were no visible characteristic lesions at the time of the examination, including scarring related to the head, face, or neck. The examiner provided no response about the amount of the total body or exposed area effected.

The Board finds the VA examination reports probative and gives them limited weight. The examiners personally examined the Veteran and reviewed the claims file. There was no evidence of skin changes, including scarring, evident during either examination. The indication that the disability was present on less than 5 percent of the Veteran's exposed and total body area in general is not inconsistent with information in the VA treatment records. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).

In September 2023, the Veteran provided a private medical opinion. See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record. The nurse practitioner opined that the Veteran's rash is consistent with a 10 percent rating. The practitioner, citing to the Lund and Browder chart (not included with the opinion), states that the front or back of an individual's head accounts for 3.5 percent of the body's surface area and each buttock account for 2.5 percent. The practitioner quotes the Veteran's statement that the service-connected disability covers "my buttocks and head". The practitioner, finding the Veteran credible, concluded that a 10 percent rating is warranted because the rash covers more than the required 5 percent of the Veteran's total body area.

The Board finds the private medical opinion not probative and gives it no weight. The opinion appears to be based solely on the Veteran's (vague) lay statement. There is nothing that indicates the practitioner considered any medical evidence, including the Veteran's report that the "rash" was limited to his right buttock during the January 2023 VA examination or that no treating provider has documented a subjective complaint or objective evidence relating to a skin condition. Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304; Stefl, 21 Vet. App. at 124.

The Board has given due consideration to all pertinent lay evidence when evaluating this claim. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). The Veteran has stated his skin condition "covers my buttocks and head". See December 2022 & September 2023 VA Form 21-4138. He experiences constant flare-ups, which includes inflammation, itchiness, discoloration, scaling, flaking/scabbing, and bleeding. He uses over-the-counter medications, such as Hydrocortisone crème and Benadryl lotion, for 6 weeks at a time.

The Board finds the Veteran competent to attest to facts and circumstances that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 438 (2011). However, the statements were made contemporaneously with his application for service connection and then his supplemental claim for a higher disability rating. The VA treatment record indicates only that he vaguely reported a skin condition during a June 2022 telephone registry. There is no evidence that he has complained about a skin condition to a treating provider. Despite claiming constant flares, including involvement of the head, no treating provider has documented a skin condition in the treatment notes leading up to and during the appeal period. In fact, the treatment notes suggest he has repeatedly denied a skin-related condition. 

The Board finds the VA treatment records and 2023 VA examination reports to be more compelling and probative than the lay statements (and private opinion) advanced for the purpose of supporting and bolstering this claim. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477, 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the Board is entitled to discount the credibility of evidence in light of its own inherent characteristics and its relationship to other items of evidence); Cartwright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24 (1991) (pecuniary interest in benefits may affect credibility of claimant's testimony); Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999) (although the Board must take into consideration the Veteran's statements, it may consider whether self-interest may be a factor in making such statements).

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against assigning a compensable rating (greater than 0 percent). While the Veteran may have a skin condition on his head and bilateral buttocks, he has provided no specific details or photographic evidence demonstrating the condition impacts more than 5 percent of his total body surface area. The medical evidence contains no objective evidence of a skin condition, including by his treating providers. The mere fact that the medical community calculates the area of an adult's head (excluding the face) and bilateral buttocks to equate to roughly 8.5 percent total body area is not persuasive evidence that the Veteran's skin condition covers 8.5 percent of his total body area.

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding the Veteran's dermatitis warrants a compensable disability rating during the appeal period. He is not entitled to the benefit of the doubt. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v, 21 F.4th at 781-82. Thus, the claim for a compensable disability rating (greater than 0 percent) for the service-connected dermatitis is denied.
