ORDER

Revision of a September 1979 rating decision that assigned an initial noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating for a sacral contusion with subjective residuals ("sacral contusion") on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 1979 rating decision, which granted service connection for a sacral contusion, assigning an initial noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating, became final because the Veteran did not submit a timely, valid notice of disagreement (NOD), and new and material evidence was not received within the appeal period nor were new, relevant service records received at any time thereafter.

2. The correct facts, as known at the time, were before the VA adjudicators in September 1979, the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were correctly applied, and there was no undebatable error, the commission of which manifestly changed the outcome of the decision regarding the assignment of an initial noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating for the sacral contusion.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for revision of a September 1979 rating decision with regard to the assignment of an initial noncompensable disability rating for a sacral contusion on the basis of clear and unmistakable error pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 have not been satisfied.  38 U.S.C. § 5109A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, had active service in the U.S. Air Force from February 1974 to July 1979.        

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA or Board) from a November 2021 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

New evidence cannot be considered in deciding motions seeking revision or reversal of prior final decisions based on CUE, as such CUE motions must be based upon the facts and law that existed at the time of the prior decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a)(1)(iii).

1. Revision of a September 1979 rating decision that assigned an initial noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating for a sacral contusion with subjective residuals ("sacral contusion") on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is denied.

The Veteran contends that the September 1979 rating decision that assigned an initial noncompensable (or zero percent) disability rating for a sacral contusion contains CUE.  Specifically, she argues that she should have received at least a 10 percent rating for the sacral contusion based on painful motion under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, as 10 percent was the minimal compensable rating under then extant DC 5295.

For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds that there is no CUE in the September 1979 rating decision.   

The September 1979 rating decision granted service connection for a sacral contusion and assigned a noncompensable disability rating under the provisions of DC 5295, effective from July 18, 1979.  The Veteran did not file a timely notice of disagreement (NOD) challenging this determination, new and material evidence was not received within one year of the rating decision, nor were new, relevant service records received at any time thereafter.  38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b) and 3.156(c).  Consequently, the September 1979 rating decision assigning the initial noncompensable disability rating for the sacral contusion became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.

In October 2021, the Veteran filed a request for revision of the initial disability rating assigned for her sacral contusion on the basis of CUE in the September 1979 rating decision.  The November 2021 rating decision on appeal found no CUE in the September 1979 rating decision.  

Once a decision becomes final, it may only be revised by a showing of CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105.  CUE is a very specific and rare kind of "error."  It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.  Simply to claim CUE on the basis that previous adjudications had improperly weighed and evaluated the evidence can never rise to the stringent definition of CUE.  Similarly, neither can broad-brush allegations of "failure to follow the regulations" or "failure to give due process," or any other general, nonspecific claim of "error."  Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43-44 (1993).  In addition, failure to address a specific regulatory provision involves harmless error unless the outcome would have been manifestly different.  Id. at 44.

Where evidence establishes CUE, the prior decision will be reversed or amended. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  For the purpose of authorizing benefits, the rating or other adjudicatory decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of CUE has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.  Id.

CUE is established when the following conditions are met: (1) either (a) the correct facts in the record were not before the adjudicator, or (b) the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at the time were incorrectly applied; (2) the alleged error must be "undebatable," not merely "a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated"; and (3) the commission of the alleged error must have "manifestly changed the outcome" of the decision being attacked on the basis of CUE at the time that decision was rendered.  Evans v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 180, 185 (2014), aff'd, 642 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Damrel v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 242, 245 (1994); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 313-14 (1992).  

The error must be of a type that is outcome-determinative, and subsequently developed evidence may not be considered in determining whether an error existed in the prior decision.  See Porter v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 233, 235-36 (1993); Glover v. West, 185 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999).  A manifest change in the outcome of an adjudication means that, absent the alleged CUE, the benefit sought would have been granted at the outset.  King v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 433, 441 (2014).  The standard is not whether it is reasonable to conclude that the outcome would have been different.  Id. at 442.

The benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application in claims of CUE. Andrews v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 177, 186 (2004) (citing Russell, 3 Vet. App. at 313) (it is well established that the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine can never be applicable in assessing a CUE motion because the nature of such a motion is that it involves more than a disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated).

As a threshold matter, the Board finds that the arguments advanced by the Veteran allege CUE with the requisite specificity.  See Simmons v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 104 (2003).  The Board will therefore adjudicate the merits of her claim.

As noted above, the Veteran contends that the RO erred in assigning a noncompensable rating for the sacral contusion in the September 1979 rating decision because 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 provides that painful motion should be recognized by assigning at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint affected, which was 10 percent under then extant DC 5295.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (1979).  

A determination of CUE must be based on the law extant at the time of the decision being challenged.  As such, the Board finds it useful to discuss the applicable laws and regulations as they existed in 1979.  As noted above, the RO, in the September 1979 rating decision, assigned a noncompensable disability rating for the sacral contusion under the provisions of DC 5295, which, at the time of the September 1979 rating decision, contemplated lumbosacral strains.  Under DC 5295, when the evidence demonstrated slight subjective symptoms only, a noncompensable, or zero percent, disability rating was assigned.  A 10 percent rating was assigned when there was characteristic pain on motion.  A 20 percent rating was assigned when there was muscle spasm on extreme forward bending, loss of lateral spine motion, unilateral, in standing position.  A 40 percent rating was assigned when there were severe symptoms, with listing of the whole spine to the opposite side, positive Goldthwaite's sign, marked limitation of forward bending in standing position, loss of lateral motion with osteoarthritic changes, or narrowing or irregularity of joint space, or some of the above with abnormal mobility on forced motion.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5295 (1979).    

In addition to the above regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, unamended since its adoption in 1964, provided as follows:

With any form of arthritis, painful motion is an important factor of disability, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to affected joints. Muscle spasm will greatly assist the identification. Sciatic neuritis is not uncommonly caused by arthritis of the spine. The intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation within the joint structures should be noted carefully as points of contact which are diseased. Flexion elicits such manifestations. The joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and nonweight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.

38 C.F.R. § 4.59 (1979).   

Evidence at the time of the September 1979 rating decision consisted of service treatment records showing that in December 1978, the Veteran was riding a bicycle when she was struck by a motorcycle and had immediate onset of pain over the coccyx.  An initial x-ray of the pelvis taken at the emergency room showed an irregular left symphysis pubis due to possible old trauma but was negative with regard to the coccyx.  She was admitted to the hospital two days later for ongoing coccyx pain.  Examination of the back revealed tenderness over the coccyx with minimal lumbosacral muscle spasm.  X-rays remained unremarkable.  During hospitalization, her muscle spasm gradually resolved, and she became increasingly ambulatory with decreasing symptoms.  Discharge diagnosis was a contusion of coccyx.

At a January 1979 follow-up for coccydynia, she reported she was much improved and relatively asymptomatic.  She had minimal tenderness over the tip of the coccyx.

A February 1979 x-ray of the lumbosacral spine and pelvic bones showed no definite evidence of fracture or dislocation.

In April 1979, the Veteran reported that she still had intermittent aching and numbness in the sacral area.  Symptoms were aggravated by heavy lifting.  Assessment was coccydynia, and she was given a profile with lifting restrictions.

The June 1979 service discharge examination noted low back tenderness on bending forward.

Following separation from service, at an August 1979 VA examination, the Veteran reported low back pain.  On exam, the lumbosacral spine had full range of motion with some discomfort at extreme flexion.  She had local tenderness of the lumbosacral spine.  The examiner noted that an x-ray taken in July 1979 showed sacralization of L5 but was otherwise within normal limits.  The examiner diagnosed a sacral contusion with subjective residuals.

Based on this evidence, the RO, in the September 1979 rating decision, granted service connection and assigned a noncompensable rating for the sacral contusion.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5295 (1979).  The narrative of the rating decision discussed the service treatment records and VA examination report, specifically noting the July 1979 x-ray study, full range of motion of the back with discomfort on extreme flexion, local tenderness of the lumbosacral spine, and complaints of pain with prolonged sitting noted at the August 1979 VA examination.      

As noted above, the Veteran argues that the finding of painful motion demonstrated by the evidence of record required a 10 percent rating for the sacral contusion under DC 5295 under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  

Here, the Board reiterates that "CUE must be analyzed based on the law as it was understood at the time of the original decision and cannot arise from a subsequent change in the law or interpretation thereof to attack a final VA decision."  George v. McDonough, 991 F.3d 1227, 1234 (Fed. Cir. 2021), aff'd 596 U.S. 740 (2022).  It is also significant to establish at this point that a change in the interpretation of law cannot form the basis for revision of a prior decision based on CUE absent expressed intent for such a conclusion within statutory or regulatory text or as otherwise set forth by controlling caselaw.  See George, 596 U.S. at 753 (holding "invalidation of a VA regulation after a veteran's benefits decision becomes final cannot support a claim for collateral relief based on clear and unmistakable error").

In Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), for the first time in a published decision, interpreted 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 to apply outside of the "arthritis" context, even though section 4.59 only lists "arthritis."  Prior to 2011, VA and appellate courts only interpreted section 4.59 to apply to arthritis.

Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) issued a relevant precedential decision in Siples v. Collins, 127 F.4th 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2025).  In that case, the Veteran argued there was CUE in a July 2004 rating decision that assigned a 10 percent disability rating for left and right shoulder subluxation disabilities under DC 5203, which compensated for malunion of the clavicle or scapula.  The veteran contended that the law at the time mandated the assignment of an additional 20 percent rating per shoulder by virtue of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 as applied through DC 5201 (limitation of arm motion), which offered a higher rating than DC 5203.  The Federal Circuit affirmed the decisions of the Board and of the Court, holding that, at the time of the 2004 rating decision at issue in that case, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 did not undebatably apply to non-arthritic conditions, such that failure to apply 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 to a non-arthritic condition in 2004 could not be CUE.  Id. at 1333.

As applied to this Veteran's CUE motion, the Board finds that at the time of the September 1979 rating decision, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 did not apply to non-arthritis claims, or at the most, there was not yet a settled interpretation of whether § 4.59 applied to non-arthritis claims.  Because the Veteran's sacral contusion did not manifest as arthritis at the time of the September 1979 rating decision - indeed, x-ray studies were consistently within normal limits - § 4.59 was not for application, or it was at most unclear if it was for application.  Thus, it cannot be said that the VA RO incorrectly applied the law at the time of the September 1979 rating decision.

Furthermore, if there was not a settled interpretation of § 4.59 at the time of the September 1979 rating decision, it cannot be an undebatable error to interpret 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 as not applying to non-arthritis claims prior to the decision of the Court in Burton.  VA does not commit clear and unmistakable error when it faithfully applies a regulation as it existed at the time of the challenged decision, even if that regulation is later revised or invalidated.  George, 596 U.S. 740.  Therefore, the Board finds that the September 1979 rating decision does not contain CUE because the RO did not incorrectly apply the statutory or regulatory provisions in existence at that time.  Even if there was such an error, reasonable minds could differ at the time of the decision as to whether 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 applied to non-arthritis disabilities.

As no other CUE arguments have been specifically pled, and for the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that there was no CUE in the September 1979 rating decision in assigning a noncompensable disability rating for the sacral contusion.  The Veteran has not contended or established that the correct facts were not before the RO at the time of the September 1979 rating decision, nor has she established that the RO incorrectly applied the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions based on the interpretations of law existing at the time of that decision.  Thus, the application to revise the September 1979 rating decision to reflect a compensable rating for the sacral contusion on the basis of CUE is denied.
