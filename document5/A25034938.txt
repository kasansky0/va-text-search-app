ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in or near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Korea during the requisite period and is therefore presumed to have been exposed to herbicides during service.

2. The Veteran has diagnoses of prostate cancer and diabetes.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetes have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1954 to August 1974, with additional service in the Air Force Reserve, died in September 2024. The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse and is the substitute claimant for purposes of processing the claim to completion. 38 U.S.C. § 5121A.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by an Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In a January 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held with the Veteran's brother and representative in September 2024; as the Veteran was in hospice, he did not attend the hearing. A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision, as well as any evidence submitted by the Appellant or representative at, or within 90 days of, the September 2024 hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the January 2024 rating decision and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A veteran who, during active military, naval, or air service, served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit that, as determined by the Department of Defense, operated in or near the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to any such agent during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iv).

Diseases associated with herbicide exposure for purposes of the presumption include prostate cancer and diabetes mellitus. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

The Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. See Wensch v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 362, 367 (2001).

Board determinations with respect to the weight and credibility of evidence are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a) requires that the VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim to disability. Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In fact, competent medical evidence is not necessarily required when the determinative issue involves either medical etiology or a medical diagnosis. Id. at 1376-77; see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b), Gilbert v. Derwinksi, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

1. Entitlement to service connection for prostate cancer is granted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes is granted.

Here, the Veteran states that he was exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Korea.

Service personnel records reflect that the Veteran was stationed at Osan and Kimpo Air Bases in Korea during the presumptive period for herbicide agent exposure.

In placing a request to the JSRRC in March 2013, to ascertain more information about the Veteran's service, it was noted that he was assigned to the 6314th Support Wing at Osan Air Base in Korea on/around August 25, 1966, through January 24, 1971; he was part of the 603rd Direct Air Support Squadron and that he regularly was "out in the field for weeks at a time," just south of the DMZ; and personnel records also show travel to Kimpo Air Base in Korea, from June 1, 1969, through March 31, 1970. A November 2014 DPRIS determination ultimately indicated that the Veteran was not in proximity to the DMZ; however, it did note that the Air Force bases in Osan and Kimpo were proximately 45 miles and 26 miles from the DMZ, respectively.

A June 2023 Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) Memorandum concluded that the Veteran did not participate in a TERA during active military service.

The Veteran submitted a March 2023 statement wherein he reported that his duties included the onloading and offloading of any materials that were transported to and from the Korean DMZ; as an administrator and crew supervisor, he personally had to attend missions on and off flights, which placed him at the Korean DMZ for several months; and, the records may not exist of these assignments as they were not a priority to maintain those records during that time. See March 2023 VA Form 21-4138. He also states he included a photograph of him near the Korean DMZ.

During the Board hearing it was discussed that the photograph was not in the record and that a copy would be supplied to the Board before the evidentiary window closed. To this date, the photograph has not been added, but there is no prejudice to the Veteran/Appellant as the Board is still able to fully grant the claims.

While the Board observes that AOJ development does not indicate that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents, the Board concludes that the Veteran's location, time period of service and in-service duties during service, are enough to concede such exposure. The Board finds as a fact in this case that the evidence is at least approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents. As the benefit of doubt is to be resolved in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's herbicide agent exposure is conceded.

Here, the pertinent medical evidence of record consists of VA treatment records. Notably, these records show a diagnosis of prostate cancer and diabetes.

Accordingly, as the Veteran has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and diabetes, presumptive diseases in veterans exposed to herbicide agents, and exposure to herbicide agents during a qualifying period of service has been conceded, service connection for such is GRANTED. The Board notes that there have been no VA opinions submitted regarding the Veteran's disabilities; however, opinions are not needed as these claims are being granted on a presumptive basis and diagnoses for prostate cancer and diabetes are shown.
