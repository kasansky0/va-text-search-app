DOCKET NO. 210831-182064
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to an initial compensable rating for other specified depressive disorder prior to January 17, 2017, and in excess of 40 percent from that date is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In March 2023, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service from July 1971 to March 1973. This matter is on appeal from a September 2020 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

The AOJ must decide all requests for substitution in the first instance. 38?C.F.R. §?3.1010(e)(1). In May 2023, VA received a request for substitution. To date, the AOJ has not ruled on that request. If the request for substitution is granted, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket. 38 C.F.R. §?20.1302(a).
