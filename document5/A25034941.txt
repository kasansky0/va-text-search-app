REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating prior to December 10, 2021, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter for traumatic brain injury (TBI) is remanded.  

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army during the Gulf War Era, from September 2007 to September 2012.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 Rating Decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The appeal has been developed under VA's Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system of review.  

The Veteran perfected this appeal by timely submitting a May 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and electing the Direct Review docket.  Although he initially requested Higher-Level Review of a January 2022 Rating Decision when he submitted a December 2022 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996), the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the RO's May 2023 supplemental claim Rating Decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted after the RO issued the supplemental claim Rating Decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300,?20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to a compensable initial rating prior to December 10, 2021, and in excess of 10 percent thereafter for TBI is remanded.  

By way of procedural background, the Veteran submitted a service connection claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for TBI on December 16, 2014, which was denied by a May 2015 Rating Decision.  After he submitted a timely appeal and the RO issued a March 2018 Statement of the Case (SOC), the Veteran submitted a May 2018 VA Form 9 substantive appeal to the Board.  Following a December 2018 Board decision that remanded the matter for additional development, and after the RO issued a December 2019 Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC), the Board issued a June 2020 decision that denied the claim.  

Subsequently, the Veteran appealed the matter to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) which, pursuant to a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) agreed upon by the parties, issued its March 2021 Order remanding the matter for action consistent with the terms of the JMPR.  After the Board again remanded the matter for necessary development in July 2021, the RO issued a January 2022 Rating Decision (under the AMA system of review) granting service connection for TBI and assigning a non-compensable initial rating effective December 16, 2014, followed by a staged rating of 10 percent effective December 10, 2021.  As discussed previously, although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review, the claim was transferred to the Supplemental Claim decision review option and the May 2023 supplemental claim Rating Decision on appeal denied increased ratings.  Thus, the rating period under review extends from December 16, 2014, through issuance of the May 2023 supplemental claim Rating Decision on appeal, specifically, May 25, 2023.       

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination conducted by a neurologist in February 2017.  However, the examiner determined that the Veteran did not have, nor ever had, a TBI or any residuals of a TBI.  He was afforded another VA examination conducted by a nurse practitioner in December 2021 that reported a diagnosis of TBI established in "2014."  

The Veteran's attorney representative contends that the December 2021 VA examination was inadequate because, inter alia, "the examiner was not qualified to administer TBI examinations" as he was not among the specialists authorized by VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual to perform initial TBI examinations, specifically, a physiatrist, psychiatrist, neurologist, or neurosurgeon.  See M21-1, IV.i.3.A.1.j.  According to a note to this manual provision, a generalist may conduct a TBI investigation under certain circumstances, but only if a TBI diagnosis is of record and was established by one of the aforementioned specialists.    

Although the Veteran was previously assessed as having a positive TBI screening according to VAMRs dated July 2014, as well as a "personal [history]" of a TBI in September 2014, the diagnosis of a TBI was not established by one of the aforementioned specialists and, instead, was reported by a licensed practical nurse and nurse practitioner respectively.  Thus, the December 2021 VA examination was inadequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  Accordingly, remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error by affording the Veteran another VA examination, to be conducted by a qualified specialist, and securing an opinion adequate for rating purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1.  Schedule the Veteran for a VA TBI residuals examination with a physiatrist, psychiatrist, neurologist, or neurosurgeon possessing the necessary expertise to fully assess and render a retrospective opinion regarding the nature and severity of his TBI residuals during the rating period under review (i.e., December 16, 2014, to May 25, 2023).  The claims file including this Board decision must be made available to the examiner to review in conjunction with the examination.  

The examiner must elicit a full history from the Veteran as to such considerations as the onset and any progression of pertinent signs and symptoms and functional limitations, and such history must be fully reported.  All indicated studies must be performed.  

Based upon review of all pertinent evidence in the claims file, the Veteran's self-reports during the examination, and the examination results, the examiner must offer a retrospective opinion providing a full description of his TBI residuals during the rating period under review, including all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating his disability under the applicable rating criteria.  

In offering the above opinion, the examiner must attempt to differentiate symptoms attributable to the Veteran's posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from those attributable to TBI residuals.  If such differentiation is not possible, the examiner must explain why.  

The examiner is advised that a mere lack of documentary evidence of record, without more, does not automatically equate to unfavorable evidence.  The Veteran's self-reports as to such considerations as symptom onset and progression must be fully considered and discussed.
