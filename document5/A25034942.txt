CONCLUSION OF LAW

A valid VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on August 6, 2019, has not been received; thus, the matter must be dismissed.  38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §§?20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1952 to August 1956.  He died in November 2024.  He did not submit an appeal in relation to this matter.   

On September 22, 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) from Benefit Recovery Business Associates (Benefit Recovery) seeking to appeal an August 2021 decision by the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA).  The NOD requested Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  The August 2021 decision denied VA payment for the cost of medical services provided to the Veteran by Baptist Memorial Hospital (BMH) on August 6, 2019.  

Under the controlling regulation, an appeal to the Board is accomplished through filing a timely, valid notice of disagreement (NOD).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201-20.204.  An NOD may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204.  A "Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38?C.F.R. §?20.3(f), (g).  Concerning claims for payment of the cost of non-VA medical services under Part 17 of the regulations, "a claimant may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services."  See e.g., 38?C.F.R. §?17.123.  

It is not shown or alleged that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider that has contracted or otherwise completed an agreement to provide community care medical services to Veterans.  It is not shown or alleged that Benefit Recovery is a hospital, clinic, or community resource, or that it otherwise provided medical services to the Veteran on August 6, 2019.  It is also not shown that Benefit Recovery is a person other than the Veteran who paid for the services.  Rather, it appears to be an entity involved with collecting outstanding bills and not an entity that provides any medical services.  Thus, it does not qualify as a "claimant" for VA benefits purposes.  See e.g., 38?C.F.R. §?17.123.  

Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not an entity that qualifies as a "representative" for purposes of filing claims/appeals for VA benefits on behalf of a Veteran or on behalf of another valid claimant/appellant, such as BMH.  See 38?C.F.R. §§ 14.626-14.629 (defining which types of individuals and entities are permitted to represent VA claimants and the requirements for accreditation of service organization representatives, agents, and attorneys).  

Because Benefit Recovery does not qualify as a claimant or as an authorized representative for VA benefits purposes, it does not have the authority to file a notice of disagreement/appeal to the Board.  Consequently, the September 22, 2021, notice of disagreement in this case is not valid.  Accordingly, as a valid appeal has not been received, the matter of entitlement to VA payment for the cost of the non-VA medical services provided to the Veteran on August 6, 2019, is dismissed.
