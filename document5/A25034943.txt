DOCKET NO. 240826-467308
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his in-service noise exposure. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served a period of active duty for training in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Reserve from April 2005 to October 2005, and he served on active duty in the USMC from December 2005 to November 2006, to include service in Southwest Asia.  He also has additional periods of inactive service in the USMC Reserve.  For his meritorious service, the Veteran was awarded (among other decorations) the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Given the date of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran's appeal is governed by the modernized review system, known by the Board as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400, 19.2. 

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision (i.e., agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision), which was subsequently subject to HLR.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to HLR, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  

Certain chronic diseases, such as organic diseases of the nervous system like tinnitus, will be presumed related to service if they were noted as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if continuity of the same symptomatology has existed since service, with no intervening cause.  38 U.S.C. § § 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2012); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record.  A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his or her current symptomatology.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient evidence of a diagnosis or to establish etiology if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition; (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis; or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 491 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  When considering whether lay evidence is competent the Board must determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the veteran's particular disability is the type of disability for which lay evidence may be competent.  Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011); see also Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376-77.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

Service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran generally contends that he has tinnitus from in-service noise exposure.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Specifically, the Veteran contends he flew countless helicopters, operated heavy machinery, and discharged many loud firearms during his service.  Id.  In addition, due to the sensitive nature of missions while on deployment to Iraq in 2005, the Veteran could not always use earplugs.  His squadron had to be able to hear and see everything happening around them because of the dangerous people they were supervising.  See December 2023 Statement from Sgt. J.M., the Veteran's Squad Leader. 

The Veteran's December 15, 2004, enlistment examination was normal.  His service treatment records (STRs) do not show treatment or a diagnosis associated with tinnitus.  However, he reported being exposed to loud noises while on deployment.  See September 14, 2006, Post-Deployment Health Assessment.  In addition, his STRs reflect a note that he was subjected to loud noises from jets that conducted high-powered engine turn-ups (HPTUs).  The note also states that the HPTUs were conducted, at times, without warning and the Veteran was unable to properly protect himself.  See September 21, 2006, STR.    

Turning to the direct service connection framework, in the July 2024 rating decision, the RO found the Veteran has been diagnosed with tinnitus.  See also January 2023 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  The RO also found the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service.  The RO conceded the Veteran's exposure to hazardous military noise based on his military occupational specialty (MOS) as a field radio operator.  See Form DD-214.  Of note, the RO conceded the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), and his exposure to hazardous material, based on service in Iraq and Kuwait as well.  As the Board is bound by the RO's favorable findings, the first and second criteria for direct service connection, a current disability and an in-service incurrence, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Therefore, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his active service, to include in-service noise exposure and participation in a TERA. 

To that point, the record contains the Veteran's competent reports that he has tinnitus.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; January 2023 and January 2024 VA Examinations for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus.  Notably, tinnitus is a disability that is capable of lay observation and does not require medical expertise to determine its presence or its relationship, if any, to prior events.  Thus, the Veteran is competent to speak to the origins of his tinnitus, including when he started having recurrent bouts of intermittent tinnitus.  The Board finds the Veteran's reported exposure is credible and consistent with the circumstances of his service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154.  Moreover, his statements are consistent with the type of service he had, and have been consistent throughout the record.  For that reason, the Board finds his statements to be credible and assigns them great probative weight. 

In January 2023 and January 2024, the Veteran underwent VA examinations for hearing loss and tinnitus with the same examiner.  During both examinations, the Veteran reported an onset of intermittent tinnitus around 2017 (or 6 years prior to the 2023 examination).  The VA examiner rendered negative nexus opinions in January 2023 and January 2024, but her opinions are inadequate because she relied on the absence of documented complaints of tinnitus in the Veteran's STRs and failed to consider the possible onset and recurrence of the Veteran's symptoms since his service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  

The Board notes that, despite diagnosing the Veteran with tinnitus in January 2023, the VA examiner indicated his description of symptoms did not meet the definition of tinnitus in January 2024.  Based on that conclusion, in a February 2024 addendum opinion, another VA examiner similarly concluded the Veteran did not have tinnitus.  Instead, the February 2024 examiner stated he has transient ear noise, a normal phenomenon.  As a result, the examiner rendered a negative nexus opinion regarding the Veteran's participation in a TERA.  The examiner opined, as the Veteran does not have true tinnitus, it becomes less likely than not that his complaint of tinnitus is a result of his military exposures.  The Board finds the February 2024 VA examiner's opinion to be adequate and assigns it probative weight.  

Nevertheless, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his in-service noise exposure.  Although the VA examiners find the Veteran does not have tinnitus, the Board reiterates tinnitus is a disability capable of lay observation.  In this case, the Veteran has continuously reported experiencing tinnitus related to his in-service noise exposure, and more significantly, the February 2024 VA examiner noted in his examination report that the records reviewed did not indicate any risk factors for tinnitus outside of military service.  Given there is no significant evidence contradicting the Veteran's account, the Board resolves all reasonable doubt in his

favor and finds that each element of the service connection framework is met for this claim.  Thus, service connection for tinnitus is granted.
