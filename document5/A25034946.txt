REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition, including as secondary to a back condition, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 2016 to September 2016, December 2017 to August 2018, and January 2021 to February 2021. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition, including as secondary to a back condition, is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for a right knee condition, including as secondary to a back condition. The Board notes that the Veteran is not currently service-connected for a back condition. 

In the October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, and there is evidence of a qualifying event, injury or disease had its onset during service, as service treatment records show the Veteran complained of right knee pain in service. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board must remand a claim to correct an error by the RO to satisfy its duty to assist the Veteran under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A if the error occurred prior to the RO decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (f)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a). The Board may also remand a claim to correct any other RO error "in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating" the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a).

A review of the claims file shows that a secondary service connection medical nexus opinion was obtained in May 2023. In July 2023, the AOJ attempted to obtain a direct service connection medical nexus opinion by requesting the following: "Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of right knee condition secondary to back condition that is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred in or caused by (the) [complaint of] bilateral knee pain in the fall of 2018 during service?" In other words, the requested opinion framed the knee condition as secondary to a back condition, rather than requesting the examiner to opine whether a knee condition was directly related to service regardless of any claimed back condition. The examiner's rationale for the negative opinion also addresses the claimed knee condition as it relates to a back condition rather than whether it is directly related to service. 

The Board finds that the opinion is inadequate, constituting a pre-decisional duty to assist error that requires remand. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802; Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding whether the Veteran's claimed right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome is at least as likely as not related to service, to include as due to in-service marches and runs while carrying heavy equipment.
