CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal seeking a restoration of a 100 percent evaluation for breast cancer residuals from January 01, 2019, to March 25, 2020, is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 7104.

2. The appeal seeking entitlement to SMC based on housebound status is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5110, 7104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1984 to October 1988.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2020 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO) rating decision in response to the Veteran filing a November 2019 supplemental claim.

In the June 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

In a January 2024 Decision, the Board denied entitlement to a restoration of a 100 percent evaluation for breast cancer residuals and restoration of an evaluation under SMC.  The Veteran appealed the denials to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC).  The Veteran and the Office of the General Counsel for VA (collectively referred to as "the Parties") resolved that appeal by way of a December 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR).  The Parties agreed that the Board needed to readjudicate these issues and they were vacated and remanded to the Board.

1. Entitlement to restoration of a 100 percent rating for breast cancer residuals from January 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, is dismissed. 

2. Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is dismissed.

In an October 23, 2018, rating decision, the RO reduced the Veteran's rating for breast cancer residuals from 100 percent to 30 percent, and found that entitlement to SMC was no longer shown, effective January 1, 2019.  The Veteran then filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in October 2019.  In a November 25, 2019, notice letter, the VA informed the Veteran that her October 2019 NOD could not be accepted because the form was outdated.  The reason for this determination is unclear.  On November 27, 2019, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim pertaining to her breast cancer residuals rating.  The Veteran requested that her supplemental claim form be added to her October 21, 2019, legacy NOD.  The record did not show that VA issued a Statement of the Case, nor did the Veteran's file show that she was informed that her November 2019 submission, in conjunction with her October 21, 2019, form, was not accepted as a NOD to the October 2018 rating decision. 

Instead, in March 2020, the RO issued a rating decision in response to the November 27, 2019, supplemental claim and continued the Veteran's 30 percent breast cancer rating and denied entitlement to SMC based on housebound status.  In response, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 in June 2020 and selected the Evidence Submission review option. 

The January 2024 the Parties to the JMPR agreed that the Board erred when it failed to provide adequate reasons or bases as to why it referred the Veteran's October 2019 NOD to the AOJ, rather than remanding the appeal for issuance of a Statement of the Case.  As the Board recognized that the appeal was submitted on the standardized legacy NOD document within one year of the October 23, 2018, the appeal is to proceed in the legacy system.

Accordingly, because the Veteran's appeal is currently pending in the Legacy System, the appeal in the AMA system is dismissed as moot.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  This dismissal has no bearing on the pending Legacy appeal.
