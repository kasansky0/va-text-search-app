ORDER

An initial compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae did not more nearly approximate characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.41 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7813.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1987 to June 1990 with additional service in the Tennessee National Guard and United States Army Reserve.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a May 8, 2023, decision. In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior May 8, 2023, decision. 

In the August 15, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 8, 2023, AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Evaluations

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The Schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of or incident to military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155;     38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.10. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of any disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Although the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over current findings, the Board is to consider a veteran's medical history in determining the applicability of a higher rating for the entire period in which the appeal has been pending. Powell v. West, 13 Vet. App. 31, 34 (1999).

Where entitlement to compensation has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). Where an appeal is based on an initial rating for a disability, however, evidence contemporaneous with the claim and the initial rating decision are most probative of the degree of disability existing when the initial rating was assigned and should be the evidence "used to decide whether an original rating on appeal was erroneous." Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999). In either case, if later evidence indicates that the degree of disability increased or decreased following the assignment of the initial rating, staged ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time. Id.; Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007) (noting that staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct time periods in which a disability exhibits symptoms that warrant different ratings). 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae.

A May 8, 2023, rating decision granted service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae and assigned an initial noncompensable rating, effective August 15, 2022; in response to the Veteran's request for HLR, the AOJ issued an October 2023 HLR decision continuing the initial noncompensable rating. This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the initial rating assigned. See VA Form 10182 (August 2024) (no argument), VA Form 20-0996 (June 2023) (no argument).

The Veteran's statements reflect that his skin affected his military career's; and his friend reported that the Veteran had a loss of confidence and irritated skin. See VA 21-4138 (November 2022), VA Form 21-10210 (November 2022).

The rating review period for this disability begins on August 15, 2022-the date of the grant of service connection; and ends on October 12, 2023-the date of the rating decision on appeal. 

The Board concludes that the criteria for a compensable rating were not more nearly approximated during the relevant rating review period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.41 4.118, DC 7813.

The Veteran's service-connected pseudofolliculitis barbae is initially evaluated noncompensable under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7813 for diseases of dermatophytosis from August 15, 2022, the day the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim for compensation. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. See Notification Letter (August 2022).

DC 7813 pertains to tinea barbae, which the Board finds most closely approximates his pseudofolliculitis barbae diagnosis. The General Rating Formula also provides that the skin condition can be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (DC 7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability. The Board has considered whether a compensable disability rating could be assigned under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, or alternatively, under any of the other listed DCs.

Under DC 7813, a rating is determined using the General Rating Formula for Skin. Under the General Rating Formula for Skin, a 10 percent rating is warranted if the disability is manifested by one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

A 30 percent rating is warranted if the disability is manifested by at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected: or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly over the past 12-month period.

A 60 percent rating is warranted if the skin condition is manifested by at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.

In addition, a note preceding 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 provides that, for the purposes of this section, "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin."

Because "systemic therapy," which is the type of therapy that creates compensability, is connected to the phrase "corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs" by "such as," those drug types do not constitute an exhaustive list of all compensable systemic therapies, but rather serve as examples of the kind and degrees of treatments used to justify a particular disability rating. Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002). Consequently, the types of systemic treatment that are compensable are not limited to "corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs." Compensation is available for all systemic therapies that are like or similar to corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs. Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 194 (2016).

In Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351, 1354-56 (Fed. Cir. 2017), the Federal Circuit found that "systemic" is defined as "pertaining to or affecting the body as a whole" and "therapy" is defined as "treatment of diseases." In Burton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 286, 291 (2018), the Court discussed two ways that a treatment could be shown to be systemic: (1) the method by which the treatment works to treat the medical condition, and (2) the side effects that are possible or actually experienced as a result of the treatment.

The Board finds that the more persuasive evidence of record does not more nearly approximate pseudofolliculitis barbae with characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

Turning to the evidence, in April 2023, the AOJ obtained both a Skin Diseases Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) and a Scar/Disfigurement DBQ. See C&P Exams (April 2023. These DBQs reflect in-person examination of the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae.  By history, the Veteran reported that he avoids shaving and uses clippers or trimmers instead. The DBQs reflect that the condition was in a "quiescent" or dormant state; that the Veteran's condition is considered chronic, and could possibly recur at any time; and that the Veteran currently had no lesions. The Scars DBQ noted that acne and facial acne scars had resolved and no longer required treatment, that the Veteran has not been previously treated with medication in the last 12 months for any skin condition, and that the Veteran had not had any treatment or procedures in the past 12 months for any skin condition. Id.

There are no treatment records relevant to pseudofolliculitis barbae dated during the rating review period though there are treatment records for acne and hyperpigmentation between November 2010 and May 2015. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (February 2023). 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability is more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, such as lesions and scarring. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Here, both the lay and the medical evidence is probative. However, neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflect that the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae met, or more nearly approximated, the criteria for a higher rating at any time between August 15, 2022, and October 12, 2023.

Given the above, the more persuasive evidence weighs against the claim for increase.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
