REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1976 to November 1978, April 1990 to April 1994, and November 1995 to May 1997.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In August 2023, the Veteran timely filed for a Higher Level Review (HLR).  The December 2023 HLR decision found no error in the November 2023 AOJ decision.  

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.  38?C.F.R. § 20.302.

Under AMA, the Board must remand issues to the AOJ to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The Veteran's claim of entitlement to compensation under 38 USC § 1151 arises from a June 2018 heart catheter procedure in which the radial sheath of the catheter could not be recovered requiring vascular surgery.

A component of a claim under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 involves a determination as to whether that any additional disability was the result of "an event not reasonably foreseeable."  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(2).  See generally McNair v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 98 (2011).  In determining whether an event was reasonably foreseeable, VA will consider whether the risk of that event was the type of risk that a reasonable health care provider would have disclosed in connection with the informed consent procedures of 38 C.F.R. § 17.32.  Id.  The informed consent form for the procedure performed in June 2018 is not associated with the claims folder, but is stored under VistA imaging.  See, e.g., CAPRI, INFORMED CONSENT CARDIOLOGY, dated June 20, 2018 (noting the informed consent form has been scanned into VistA imaging).  The informed consent form is constructively contained in the record, and must be obtained for actual review.  Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611 (1992).

VA treatment records reflect that additional records scanned into VistA may also be relevant to the Veteran's claim.  See CAPRI, April 20, 2018, CARDIOLOGY EVENT MONITOR REPORT; May 1, 2018, SCANNED NON-VA MEDICAL RECORDS; July 9, 2019, MRI SAFETY SCREENING FORM; June 21, 2021, CONSENT CLINICAL IMED; and January 4, 2022, OUTSIDE MEDICAL RECORDS.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Associate with the claims folder relevant records scanned into VistA, including records related to the following:

"	CAPRI, INFORMED CONSENT CARDIOLOGY, dated June 20, 2018 (noting the informed consent form has been scanned into VistA imaging);

"	CAPRI, April 20, 2018. CARDIOLOGY EVENT MONITOR REPORT; 

"	May 1, 2018, SCANNED NON-VA MEDICAL RECORDS; 

"	July 9, 2019, MRI SAFETY SCREENING FORM; 

"	June 21, 2021, CONSENT CLINICAL IMED; and 

"	January 4, 2022, OUTSIDE MEDICAL RECORDS.
