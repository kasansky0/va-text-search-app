FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that lumbosacral strain, claimed as back pain, began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that left knee pain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that right knee pain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

4. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that left ankle pain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that right ankle pain began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that headaches began during active service or are otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2012 to November 2015.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal for the issue of service connection for lumbosacral strain, the earlier October 2023 rating decision on appeal for the issue of service connection for depressive disorder, and the earlier October 2023 rating decision on appeal for the issues of service connection for left and right knee pain, left and right ankle pain, and headaches.   38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Entitlement to service connection for lumbosacral strain (claimed as back pain) 

The Veteran contends in his May 2023 claim for benefits that his back pain is caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure.  A specific contention as to how his back pain is related to service was not provided.   

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of lumbosacral strain and low back pain, and evidence shows that he was treated in service for back pain, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's diagnosis of back pain and lumbosacral strain began during service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease. 

Service treatment records from April 2015 reflect the Veteran was seen for an acute myofascial thoracic strain.  It was noted to be a soft tissue musculoskeletal sprain/strain.  The Veteran's report of medical examination for separation from service, in July 2015, a few months later, did not include any concerns regarding the Veteran's back.  Nor did the Veteran report any concerns with respect to his back in his report of medical history, which while undated, the purpose of the examination was noted as separation.  VA treatment records include notations of low back pain from November 2019, years after separation from service.  At the time of the August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was assessed with a lumbosacral strain and provided a date of diagnosis of August 2023.  At that time, the Veteran reported the condition began in 2014 and symptoms at onset were back pain and the current symptoms were back pain.  He reported no current treatment and that the condition has continued.  

In an October 2023 opinion, a VA clinician opined that the Veteran's diagnosis of back pain is less likely than not incurred in or caused by back pain treatment during service.  The clinician explained that the Veteran is 31 years old and the separation exam in July 2015 noted normal spine and musculoskeletal exam and the Veteran denied any recurrent back pain or back problems.  The examiner indicated that medical records note evaluation in April 2015 due to left medial scapular pain and he was evaluated in November 2019 due to reports of occasional low back pain but denied any injury.  The clinician indicated that it was assessed as low back pain and treated with over-the-counter medications.  The clinician further noted that June 2021 and April 2022 nurse practitioner notes included an assessment of low back pain, and the August 2023 disability benefits questionnaire listed a diagnosis of lumbosacral strain which the Veteran stated began in 2014.  The clinician noted that medical literature on low back strains and sprains discusses this is when the muscle and tissue become swollen due to inflammation that can cause pain as well as muscle spasms.  Movements of twisting and bending can cause inflammation of the muscle fibers.  The clinician noted that the Veteran complained of back pain starting in 2014, but service treatment records note evaluation in 2015 due to scapular pain.  The examiner indicated that there is no listing of back pain or recurrent back pain on separation exam.  He concluded that given findings in the medical records as well as review of the medical literature it is his opinion that the Veteran's diagnosis of back pain is less likely than not incurred in or caused by back pain treatment during service.  

The Veteran believes the claimed back pain is related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  The Veteran in this case is not competent to provide a nexus opinion regarding this issue.  It is outside the competence of the Veteran in this case because the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the opinion of the October VA clinician.   

With respect to exposures, a July 2023 VA memorandum indicated the Veteran did not participate in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during active military service and there is no indication in the record otherwise to suggest such an exposure that could constitute an in-service incident.  Furthermore, even if there was an exposure, a TERA opinion is not required for disabilities resulting from physical trauma.  See VBA Letter 20-24-06, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 89 Fed. Reg. 51,224 (Jun. 17, 2024).  In this case, the Veteran's back pain would constitute such an exception.  

Accordingly, the evidence persuasively weighs against the grant of service connection for back pain/lumbosacral strain.  As the weight of the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Therefore, service connection for back pain/lumbosacral strain is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left knee pain 

3. Entitlement to service connection for right knee pain 

4. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle pain  

5. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle pain  

6. Entitlement to service connection for headaches 

In his May 2023 claim for benefits the Veteran indicated knee pain, ankle pain and headaches were caused by an in-service event, injury, or exposure, but did not provide any specific contentions.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

With respect to the first element of a current disability, the medical evidence of record does not reflect any diagnoses or treatment related to the Veteran's ankles, knees, or headaches.  However, in Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit held that "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."  Id. at 1367-69.  The Veteran is competent to report experiencing pain and headaches and the Board interprets his claim as an indication that he is experiencing bilateral ankle and knee pain and headaches.  However, with respect to his knee and ankle pain, nothing in the record suggests the pain he is experiencing reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  There are no lay statements describing the level of pain or treatment records discussing concerns.  Even assuming the Veteran has current disabilities of bilateral knee and ankle pain, the record does not reflect an in-service incident.

The Veteran has not explained an incident or injury in service related to his knees, ankles, or headaches.  Nor do his service treatment records reflect any treatment or notations regarding his knees, ankles, or headaches.  With respect to exposures, a July 2023 VA memorandum indicated the Veteran did not participate in a toxic exposure risk activity during active military service and there is no indication in the record otherwise to suggest such an exposure that could constitute an in-service incident.    

Accordingly, the evidence persuasively weighs against the grant of service connection for bilateral knee and ankle pain and headaches.  As the weight of the evidence is not in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Therefore, service connection for bilateral knee and ankle pain and headaches must be denied.

The Board notes the Veteran may file a supplemental claim at any time and is welcome to explain what type of pain he is experiencing, how it is impacting his daily activities, and why he believes his current pain symptoms and headaches are related to service.  

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include other specified depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder 

The issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the October 2023 rating decision on appeal.  The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained an August 2023 medical opinion prior to the October 2023 rating decision on appeal.  However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

In a June 2023 statement in support of claim, the Veteran explained experiencing psychiatric symptoms related to night infiltration courses during basic training.  In an August 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with other specified depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.  In an October 2023 opinion the VA clinician opined the claimed condition is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness.  She noted the rationale is, 

that the only mental health 'treatment' during service was related to alcohol abuse.  The [V]eteran's STR was negative for a diagnosis of depression or anxiety.  He had a general under honorable discharge for misconduct in 2015 after a series of alcohol issues.  Of note his alcohol and cannabis use was documented in the STR as having pre-existed service.  At that time he was screened for all potential conditions and did not meet criteria for any other mental disorder.  He also denied any PTSD symptoms.  In 2022 he presented to the VA with a one year history of depression/anxiety.  This has no nexus to service.   

The examiner did not consider the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement.  Additionally, a VA examination is inadequate for adjudicative purposes when a VA examiner relies on the absence of evidence in the service treatment records to provide a negative opinion.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).  Remand is warranted for an addendum opinion.  

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

(Continued on the next page)

?

1. Obtain an addendum opinion from a qualified clinician.  The clinician should address whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability, to include depression and anxiety, is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, including night infiltration courses during basic training, as discussed in his June 2023 statement in support of claim.  The clinician is reminded that the clinician must provide specific evidence of record to support his/her conclusions, such as references from this Veteran's relevant medical history and/or medical literature.  THE EXAMINER CANNOT RELY SOLELY ON THE ABSENCE OF DOCUMENTED TREATMENT IN SERVICE.
