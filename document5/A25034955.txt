FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2013 to June 2018. The matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from August 2023 and October 2023 rating decisions issued by a Regional Office (RO) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective August 2023 and October 2023 RO decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the RO decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of bilateral knee disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

Legal Criteria-Service Connection

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active military service or, if pre-existing such service, was aggravated thereby. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may be established for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to prevail on a claim of direct service connection on the merits, there must be competent evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent competent medical and lay evidence. Competent medical evidence is evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions. Competent medical evidence may also include statements conveying sound medical principles found in medical treatises. It also includes statements contained in authoritative writings, such as medical and scientific articles and research reports or analyses. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).

Competent lay evidence is any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Id. § 3.159(a)(2). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. Id. This may include some medical matters, such as describing symptoms or relating a contemporaneous medical diagnosis. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Lay evidence concerning continuity of symptoms after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The Board is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claims or is in approximate balance, with the veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claims, in which case the claims are denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded to the claimant. Id.

The Board is required to assess the credibility and probative weight of all relevant evidence, and may consider factors such as facial plausibility, bias, self-interest, and consistency with other evidence of record. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 325 (2007) (Greene, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the Board has the duty to assess credibility and probative weight of evidence); see Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376 (affirming that the Board retains discretion to make credibility determinations and otherwise weigh the evidence submitted, including lay evidence); Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1337 (holding that the Board, as fact finder, is obligated to, and fully justified in, determining whether lay evidence is credible in and of itself, i.e., because of possible bias, conflicting statements, etc.). The court has also held that contemporaneous records are more probative than history reported by an appellant. See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994).

In evaluating the probative value of competent medical evidence, the court has stated that the probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge, and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches. Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his heat stroke should be service connected for purposes of disability compensation. 

Regarding the first element of service connection - current disability - the Veteran was diagnosed with heat stroke at the August 2023 VA examination. Therefore, the first element of a service connection claim is met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As to the second element of service connection - in service incurrence or aggravation - the September 2023 rating decision included a favorable finding that "a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service" as "service treatment records show [the Veteran] had a heat stroke in service." See September 2023 Rating Decision (alteration added). The Board is bound by this favorable finding. Therefore, the second element of a service connection claim is met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Finally, regarding the third element of service connection - nexus - the August 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's heat stroke is "at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness." In support of this conclusion, the VA examiner stated the following:

Review of STRs notes documentation on his separation exam of Veteran suffering from heat stroke in 2015 and being hospitalized for 2 days. Review of medical literature notes that heat stroke is a condition caused by the body overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures, is the most serious form of heat injury, and is caused by exposure to a hot environment or strenuous activity. Therefore, his heat stroke was at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) incurred in or caused by (the) heat stroke/injury noted on Separation Exam during service.

See August 2023 VA examination. 

The probative value of medical opinions is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, their knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that they reach. The VA examiner's medical opinion considers the lay statements of the Veteran, cites to relevant medical literature, and his rationale is clear and consistent with the evidence available. The Board, therefore, finds the VA examiner's opinion to be highly probative medical evidence in favor of the Veteran's claim. Therefore, the third element of a service connection claim is met. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

Consequently, because the VA examiner found the Veteran's heat stroke was incurred in and related to the Veteran's active service, service connection is established, and the appeal is granted.

Legal Criteria-Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is in turn based on the average impairment of earning capacity caused by a given disability. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the evaluations to be assigned to the various disabilities.

Where, as here, the appeal arises from the original assignment of a disability rating following an award of service connection, the severity of the disability at issue is to be considered during the entire period from the initial assignment of the disability rating to the present time.

If there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

If different disability ratings are warranted for different periods of time over the life of a claim, "staged" ratings may be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).

In accordance with sections 4.1 and 4.2 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations and Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991), the Board has reviewed all evidence of record pertaining to the history of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities. The Board has found nothing in the historical record which would lead to the conclusion that the current evidence of record is not adequate for rating purposes.

Additionally, when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Additionally, the evaluation of the same disability under several Diagnostic Codes, known as pyramiding, must be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. Separate ratings may be assigned for distinct disabilities resulting from the same injury only where the symptomatology for one condition is not duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

In evaluating the severity of a particular disability, it is essential to consider its history. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

The Board is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Rating Criteria-Radiculopathy 

The Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy is rated under DC 8520 and was previously rated under DC 8521. Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. 

Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling. Id. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling. Id. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling. Id. Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling. Id. Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling. Id.

The words "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "marked" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Therefore, the Board will utilize definitions provided by a general-purpose dictionary to give these terms their ordinary meaning. Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (in the absence of an express definition, words are given their ordinary meaning). Mild is generally defined as not being or involving what is extreme or not severe. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th ed. 2003). Moderate is generally defined as tending toward the mean or average amount. Id. at 798. Severe is generally defined as of a great degree or serious. Id. at 1140. Moderately severe, by extension, lies somewhere in the middle of these definitions; more than moderate but less than severe. And marked is defined as "distinctive . . . strongly pronounced . . .  noticeable." Webster's Third International Dictionary (1986) at 1383.

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves." The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory. See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

Relevant Facts

The Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding the severity of his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy in March 2023. The Veteran reported that the pain is constant, and that when he experiences flare ups, the pain spikes to a level 9 out of 10. The Veteran noted that everyday activities such as sitting too long, bending at the waist, or being in the supine position result in flare ups, and that he does, in fact, experience flare ups daily. He described the numbness and tingling sensations associated with his radiculopathy as moderate.

The VA examiner noted symptoms of moderate intermittent pain, bilaterally, as well as moderate paresthesias and numbness. During the sensory examination, the Veteran displayed decreased sensation in his left "thigh/knee," "lower leg/ankle," and "foot/toes." See March 2023 VA Examination. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not display any trophic changes and that his gait was normal. Id.

The VA examiner ultimately opined that the Veteran was experiencing bilateral moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Id. The remaining nerves tested were considered "normal." Id.

Analysis

Based on the above, the Board finds that, during the period on appeal, the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was primarily manifest by constant pain with severe flare ups daily and moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disabilities were manifest by impairment of motor functions, trophic changes, sensory disturbance, muscle atrophy, or complete paralysis during this period. The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderate incomplete paralysis, which is contemplated by a 20 percent disability rating.

All potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered, and there is no basis to assign an alternative evaluation. Schafrath, 1 Vet. App. at 593.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs in favor of granting a 20 percent disability rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy. Therefore, the appeal is granted.

Finally, the Veteran has not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, for the Board's consideration on this matter. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

Rating Criteria-Cervical Strain

The Veteran's cervical strain is currently rated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237. Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the cervical spine greater than 170 degrees but not greater than 335 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 15 degrees but not greater than 30 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the cervical spine not greater than 170 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. Id.

A 30 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. Id. A 40 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. Id. A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. Id.

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate DC. Id. at Note 1.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). 

Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flareup is not observable at the time of examination.

Relevant Facts

The Veteran underwent a VA examination regarding the severity of his cervical strain in March 2023. The Veteran described constant pain in the cervical spine that flares up weekly. The Veteran described the pain as a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 during flare ups. The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experiences functional loss or functional impairment during flair ups that result in difficulty with twisting motions. The Veteran explained that he uses Tylenol, polar therapy, and hot baths to treat the condition.

Initial active range of motion testing showed 24 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for forward flexion; 43 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for extension endpoint; 30 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for right lateral flexion endpoint; 30 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for left lateral flexion endpoint; 70 degrees (out of a normal 80 degrees) for right lateral rotation endpoint; and 60 degrees (out of a normal 80 degrees) for left lateral rotation end point. There was no additional loss of function or range of motion for passive range of motion or after repeated use over time. However, the Veteran did report pain for each of the measurements on both active and passive range of motion testing; the Veteran did not report pain during weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing activities.

Regarding range of motion during flare ups, the Veteran reported 19 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for forward flexion; 38 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for extension endpoint; 25 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for right lateral flexion endpoint; 25 degrees (out of a normal 45 degrees) for left lateral flexion endpoint; 65 degrees (out of a normal 80 degrees) for right lateral rotation endpoint; and 55 degrees (out of a normal 80 degrees) for left lateral rotation end point.

The Veteran reported guarding, however, the VA examiner found that the guarding did not result in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour.

The VA examiner opined that "due to the neck condition, Veteran would have difficulty with a job that required twisting motions of the neck." There was no evidence of ankylosis nor IVDS during the examination.

Analysis

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that the evidence weighs against a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for cervical strain.

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, however the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in limitation of motion more nearly approximating forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine. The Veteran's March 2023 VA examination shows forward flexion to 19 degrees during flare ups and no ankylosis.

The Board has also given consideration to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating IVDS; however, the Veteran does not have IVDS, and the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine disability manifested any associated objective neurologic abnormalities at any time during the appeal period; however, the evidence does not demonstrate that he has experienced any such abnormalities apart from ones for which he is already compensated for.

Overall, the Board has reviewed and considered the assertions of the Veteran, including his report of neck pain. However, even considering his subjective complaints of pain and other symptoms described in DeLuca, forward flexion of the cervical spine to 15 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire cervical spine has not been shown to warrant a higher rating. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that provision describing functional loss due to disability of the musculoskeletal system does not supersede requirements for a higher rating specified in the Rating Schedule).

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for service-connected cervical strain. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against ratings in excess of 20 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th at 781-82. The claim is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

As discussed below, the Board finds that there are pre-decisional duty-to-assist errors in this case, and that a VA examination is required, on remand, to cure the errors.

The Veteran's bilateral knee disabilities were tested and evaluated at a March 2022 VA examination. At the March 2023 VA examination, the examiner found that the Veteran did not experience flare ups in his bilateral knee disabilities. However, during that same March 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his bilateral knee pain is chronic, and further, the Veteran reported to the examiner that "running, standing too long, stairs" trigger the pain to a 7 out of 10.

The law establishing the modernized review system abrogated the Secretary's duty to assist for cases on appeal to the Board. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(e)(2). But the duty to assist remains in full force when a claim is before the RO for adjudication. Id. § 5103A(e)(1). And if the Board identifies a duty-to-assist error that occurred prior to the issuance of the decision on appeal, it must remand the matter to the RO to cure the error. Id. § 5103A(f)(2)(A).

So, the question for the Board is whether deciding the claims relying on the March 2023 VA examination constitutes a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error, for which the Board must remand the claim to cure.

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). An opinion is inadequate if it is based on incorrect facts, applies an incorrect standard, or if it does not consider all the relevant evidence of record, including lay statements. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). Because the March 2023 VA examiner failed to address the Veteran's statements that he experiences severe flare ups in his bilateral knee disabilities, the March 2023 examination is inadequate. See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016) (holding that "the VA examiner's failure to consider [a veteran's] testimony when formulating her opinion renders that opinion inadequate") (alteration added); see also Sharp, 29 Vet. App. 26.

As such, the Board finds that remand is necessary to obtain a medical opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's service-connected bilateral knee disabilities in accordance with the caselaw and to fulfill the duty to assist.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a medical examination with the March 2023 VA examiner, or a suitable examiner if this individual is not available, to determine the severity of the service-connected bilateral knee disabilities. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria and in accordance with the governing caselaw, including a discussion of the Veteran's flare ups.
