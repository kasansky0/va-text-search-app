ORDER

An effective date of October 9, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is granted.

Entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACTS

1. The Veteran filed an October 9, 2018, Intent to File, followed by a formal claim for increased ratings received within one year, and it is factually ascertainable that her service-connected disabilities rendered her unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment consistent with her education and work history throughout the pendency of the appeal. 

2. For the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected fibromyalgia, alone, rendered her unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment, and she had additional service-connected disabilities rated as at least 60 percent disabling.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of October 9, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

2. The criteria for SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1114(s), 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.351, 3.352.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1986 to January 1994.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2019 rating decision issued by a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

In May 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 and requested the AMA Evidence Submission docket.  As a result, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or her representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the VA Form 10182 was received, or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days after the VA Form 10182 was received.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

In March 2024, the Board issued a decision denying entitlement to (1) a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), paresthesias, left hand; (2) a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for CTS, paresthesias, right hand; (3) a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease, cervical spine (neck condition); (4) a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS), spondylolisthesis L5-S1, residuals of thoracic strain, degenerative disc disease (back condition); (5) a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for residuals, ligament strain, degenerative arthritis, left knee (left knee condition); (6) a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for radiculopathy, left lower extremity (sciatic nerve) (LLE radiculopathy); (7) a compensable disability rating for residual scars, left lower extremity; (8) a compensable disability rating for residual scar, posterior trunk; (9) a compensable disability rating for residual scar, right upper extremity; (10) a disability rating in excess of 40 percent for fibromyalgia; (11) service connection for breast cancer; (12) service connection for lymph cancer; (13) an effective date earlier than October 9, 2018, for the award of an increased rating of 20 percent for CTS, left hand; (14) an effective date earlier than October 9, 2018, for the award of an increased rating to 20 percent for neck condition; (15) an effective date earlier than October 9, 2018, for the award of an increased rating to 20 percent for back  condition; and (16) an effective date earlier than October 9, 2018, for the award of an increased rating to 10 percent for left knee condition.  

The Veteran appealed part of the decision to the United States Court of Appeals of Veterans Claims (Court).  In December 2024, VA and the Veteran filed a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR), which vacated the part of the March 2024 Board Decision that did not address the issue of entitlement to a TDIU prior to December 23, 2020, and remanded the issue for readjudication.  The matter now returns to the Board for further appellate review.  

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 23, 2020, for the award of a TDIU. 

In an August 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU effective December 23, 2020.  The Veteran contends that she is entitled to an earlier effective date for this award.

A claim for TDIU may be initiated in one of two ways.  First, through a standard application (VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability). Second, through the context of an increased rating claim when evidence of unemployability is raised. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009) (when evidence of unemployability is submitted during the course of an appeal from an assigned disability rating, a claim for entitlement to TDIU will be considered to have been raised by the record as "part and parcel" of the underlying claim).

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Effective March 24, 2015, a change in the regulation requires claims be filed on standard forms. The regulation provides that a claimant may request an application for benefits, upon receipt of which, the Secretary shall notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application form or form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) saved electronic application-when an application otherwise meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims-submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system, (ii) written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary, and (iii) oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel, recorded in writing, and documented in the claimant's records. Id.

Generally, a claim for a TDIU is thought of as equivalent to a claim for an increased rating. An exception to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 provides that in cases involving increases for disability compensation, the effective date will be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the claim is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997).  

Total disability ratings for compensation based on individual unemployability may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  For the purpose of determining one 60 percent disability, disabilities resulting from a common etiology or a single accident are considered as one disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 416(a).

Unlike the regular disability rating schedule, which is based on the average work-related impairment caused by a disability, "entitlement to a TDIU is based on an individual's particular circumstances." Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 452 (2009). Therefore, when adjudicating a TDIU claim, VA must take into account the individual veteran's education, training, and work history. Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164 (1991) (level of education is a factor in deciding employability); Friscia v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 294 (1994) (considering Veteran's experience as a pilot, his training in business administration and computer programming, and his history of obtaining and losing 19 jobs in the previous 18 years); Beaty v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 532 (1994) (considering Veteran's 8th grade education and sole occupation as a farmer); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991) (considering Veteran's master's degree in education and his part-time work as a tutor).

Age may not be considered as a factor when evaluating unemployability or intercurrent disability, and it may not be used as a basis for a total disability rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.19. There must be a determination that the service-connected disabilities are sufficient to produce unemployability without regard to advancing age or a non-service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment. The ultimate question, however, is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993).

In Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019), the Court defined the term "unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation" in § 4.16(b) to include two components: one economic and one noneconomic. The economic component means an occupation earning more than marginal income (outside of a protected environment) as determined by the U.S. Department of Commerce as the poverty threshold for one person. The non-economic component includes consideration of the veteran's history, education, skill, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability to perform the type of activities required by the occupation at issue; and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue.

Turning to the matter at hand, the Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim that was received by VA on October 9, 2018.  Thereafter, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for increased ratings on December 12, 2018.  In a May 2019 rating decision, the AOJ, in part, adjudicated the December 2018 application as a request for increased ratings for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, but did not address entitlement to a TDIU.  

At the time the Veteran submitted her December 2018 application, there is an April 1999 letter from VA recognizing a Congressional letter as acceptable as an informal claim for unemployability.  However, according to the Veteran's December 2020 VA Form 8940, she was employed from 1997 to 2017.  This is reinforced from a July 13, 1999, report of contact, wherein the Veteran explained that she was still working, but was finding it very difficult due to her disabilities.  

Here, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 8940 in December 2020.  However, the appeal period before the Board stems from the Veteran's claims for increased ratings for her service-connected disabilities on December 12, 2018, pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).  If an increase in severity of disease is ascertainable prior to a year before the filing date, the effective date shall be the date the increase in severity is discernable.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  

Upon review of one year prior to the Veteran's intent to file, there is no documentation that could be construed as an informal or formal claim prior to receipt of the Veteran's intent to file.   

In addition, the Board finds there is no documentation that an increase in the severity of the Veteran's service-connected disabilities occurred within one year of receipt of her intent to file that rendered her unable to maintain substantially gainful employment.  The Board notes a January 2021 Social Security Administration (SSA) decision that found the Veteran had been disabled since May 1, 2018.  However, the Veteran's VA Form 8940 documented that she had stopped working in January 2017, which is more than one year prior to the receipt of her intent to file.  

Nevertheless, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for a TDIU since the receipt of her intent to file on October 9, 2018, and she has not been gainfully employed since receipt of her intent to file.  Moreover, the evidence indicates that the severity of her service-connected disabilities, aside from her chronic sinusitis, pansinusitis, and radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, and the resulting impairment therefrom has remained the same throughout this period.  Therefore, the evidence supports entitlement to an effective date of October 9, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of a TDIU.  

2. Entitlement to SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s).

The Veteran's attorney contends she is entitled to SMC at the statutory housebound rate based on a finding that a single service-connected disability rendered her unemployable.  

VA's duty to maximize benefits requires it to assess all of a claimant's service-connected disabilities to determine whether any combination of the disabilities establishes eligibility for SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). See Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 250 (2011); Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280, 294 (2008).  SMC at the housebound rate, in pertinent part, is warranted when a veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and has additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently rated as 60 percent disabling; or, is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  In Bradley, the Court held that 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) permits a TDIU rating based on a single disability to satisfy the statutory requirement of a "total" rating. When a veteran is awarded TDIU based on a single disability and receives schedular disability ratings for other conditions, special monthly compensation based on the statutory housebound criteria may be awarded so long as the same disability is not counted twice, i.e., as a basis for TDIU and as a separate disability rated 60 percent or more disabling.

The record indicates the Veteran was previously awarded a TDIU based on the combined effects of her service-connected disabilities.  Through this Board Decision, the Veteran has been granted an earlier effective date of October 9, 2018, for the award of a TDIU.  

From October 9, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities are as follows: migraines rated as 50 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; chronic sinusitis rated as 10 percent disabling from October 9, 2018, and 50 percent disabling from April 25, 2023; fibromyalgia rated as 40 percent disabling from March 20, 2001; TMJ dysfunction rated as 30 percent disabling from February 18, 1995; allergic rhinitis rated as 30 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; degenerative arthritis, degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the cervical spine rated as 10 percent disabling from January 24, 1994, and 20 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) rated as 10 percent disabling from January 24, 1994, and 20 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; carpal tunnel syndrome of the left hand rated as 10 percent disabling from February 18, 1995, and 20 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, sciatic nerve, rated as 10 percent disabling from October 9, 2018, and 20 percent disabling from December 23, 2020; carpal tunnel syndrome of the right hand rated as 10 percent disabling from February 18, 1995; residuals of ligament strain, degenerative arthritis of the left knee rate as noncompensable from January 24, 1994, and 10 percent from October 9, 2018; irritable bowel syndrome rated as 10 percent disabling from October 9, 2018; residuals of thoracic strain rated as noncompensable from February 18, 1995 to October 9, 2018; residual scars of the right upper extremity associated with carpal tunnel syndrome rated as noncompensable from October 9, 2018; residual scar of the left lower extremity associated with residuals of ligament strain, degenerative arthritis of the left knee rated as noncompensable from October 9, 2018, and; residual scar of the posterior trunk associated with IVDS rated as noncompensable from October 9, 2018.  

The Veteran does not have a single service-connected disability rated as totally disabling at any time during the appeal period.  Thus, the inquiry is whether the Veteran was rendered unemployable due solely to a single service-connected disability, with additional, separate service-connected disability ratable as at least 60 percent disabling. 

The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's fibromyalgia prevented her from returning to her former occupation doing electrical work.  Per a March 2019 VA medical examination for the Veteran's fibromyalgia, the examiner opined the Veteran is impacted because she is limited in positions that would require more than light exertion.  Specifically, she will have difficulties with any activity that requires sitting, standing, walking, and/or heavy lifting for extensive periods of time, which could affect her ability to complete her daily routines and tasks. In this regard, the Veteran's VA Form 21-8940 documents that she only completed three years of college, and her last employment was doing electrical work at Boeing.  The Board notes that mechanical work requires a fair degree of physical labor, including the physical tasks noted by the March 2019 examiner, which would be inhibited by the physical limitations from the Veteran's service-connected fibromyalgia.  Positions of mechanical work do not provide much, if any, physical accommodations that the Veteran would be required to have given her medical circumstances.  As previously explained, although the Veteran attended college, she did not obtain a degree, which limits her professional options to positions that do not require manual labor.  When taking the Veteran's education and work history into consideration, her service-connected fibromyalgia rendered her unemployable.  

Additionally, the Veteran's other service-connected disabilities, combined, are independently ratable at 60 percent as of October 19, 2018.  Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for SMC at the housebound rate as of October 19, 2018.  Accordingly, SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is warranted.
