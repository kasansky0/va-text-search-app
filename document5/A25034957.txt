DOCKET NO. 250319-526152
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

The appeal arising from the March 19, 2025 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 NOD in March 2025 on the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension (Pact Act); however, there is no rating decision addressing this claim within one year prior to receipt of the March 2025 NOD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the March 19, 2025 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7108; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service in the U.S. Army from September 1966 to May 1969.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). AMA became effective on February 19, 2019.

In November 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526 requesting service connection for hypertension claimed as due to toxic exposure. On November 29, 2024, the AOJ informed the Veteran that they received mail indicating that he would like review of the claim for hypertension (high blood pressure) that was previously denied. The AOJ informed the Veteran that VA regulations required that he file his request on the proper form. The Veteran was advised to review the table regarding the proper form to use. He was then instructed to complete, sign, and return that form to the AOJ. 

On March 19, 2025, the AOJ received the Veteran's VA Form 10182 which expressed disagreement with the November 29, 2024 correspondence. Indeed, the AOJ has not, in fact, adjudicated the claim for service connection for hypertension during this period of time. Rather, the AOJ has advised the Veteran to submit the proper form so that the claim for service connection for hypertension can be adjudicated. Thus, no adverse decision has been made in this matter and there is no decision for the Veteran to appeal.

The Veteran's appeal has been docketed at the Board. However, as with any appellate system, the Board's mere administrative docketing of a claim does not demonstrate acceptance or waiver of a claims processing rule as it is a ministerial act. See Martin v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The Board observes that, in Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), the Court referenced a notice of disagreement under the Legacy system as a "nonjurisdictional claims processing rule" and specifically stated that "[t]o the extent that any of our prior cases have held that the deadline for filing an NOD is jurisdictional, they are overruled." This reasoning should apply to an AMA NOD.

In this case, the Board finds that the Veteran has not properly followed the AMA administrative review options to allow for Board review of a claim for service connection for hypertension. As such, the claim is dismissed for failure to comply with the appropriate claims processing rules. See 38 U.S.C. ยง 7108.

If the Veteran wishes to file a claim for service connection for  hypertension, he should file the claim on VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim.
