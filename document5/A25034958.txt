DOCKET NO. 250311-527374
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a disability evaluation of 10 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's hypertension is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension has a history of diastolic pressure of predominately 100 or more which requires the constant use of medication, but not a diastolic pressure of predominately 110 or more, or systolic pressure of predominately 200 or more.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent disability evaluation, but no higher, for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from November 1968 to July 1970.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. The AMA modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019 effective date of the modernized review system.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 Higher-Level Review decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the March 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review option. For the Direct Lane docket, the Board's review is limited to the evidentiary record at the time of the RO decision on appeal. See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, (2021). 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule).?38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10.? 

In evaluating a disability, the Board considers the current examination reports in light of the whole recorded history to ensure that the current rating accurately reflects the severity of the condition. The Board has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?589 (1991). The medical, as well as industrial history is to be considered, and a full description of the effects of the disability upon ordinary activity is also required. 38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.? Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.?See?38?C.F.R. §?4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor.?38?C.F.R. §?4.3.? Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged" ratings.?Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505.? 

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a Veteran prevailing in either event, or the evidence is persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.?38?U.S.C. §?5107 (b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b).

1. Entitlement to a disability evaluation of 10 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's hypertension is granted. 

The Veteran's is currently in receipt of a noncompensable disability evaluation for hypertension effective May 15, 2023, under Diagnostic Code 7101. 38?C.F.R. §?4.104. The Veteran contends that his hypertension warrants a higher rating. 

In May 2024, the Veteran was granted service connection for hypertension and assigned noncompensable disability rating effective May 15, 2023. The Veteran next filed a June 2024 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, seeking an increased rating for his hypertension, which was denied in the September 2024 Higher-Level Review Decision.

Diagnostic Code 7101 provides that a 10 percent disability evaluation is warranted where diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more, or the individual has a history of diastolic pressure of 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control. See?38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. A 20 percent disability evaluation is warranted when diastolic pressure must be predominantly 110 or more or systolic pressure must be 200 or more. A 40 percent disability evaluation requires diastolic pressure to be predominantly 120 or more, and a 60 percent disability evaluation requires diastolic blood pressure to be predominantly 130 or more. Id. 

Although the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination, the Veteran's VA treatment records provide insight to the nature and severity of the Veteran's hypertension. Notably, the Veteran requires the continuous use of medication to control his hypertension. In March 2024, the Veteran reported that his blood pressure still varies greatly despite his medication. Recent blood pressure readings are available in the Veteran's VA treatment records. On April 2, 2024, the Veterans blood pressure reading was 118/68, on April 22, 2024, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 114/74, and on May 14, 2024, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 104/67. While the Veteran's current diastolic blood pressure in recent readings is under 100, these readings have been taken while the Veteran has been taking continuous medication to control his hypertension. Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds the Veteran's diastolic pressure was historically predominately 100 or more, which required the Veteran to take medication to control his blood pressure. A higher 20 percent rating is not warranted unless the Veteran's diastolic pressure is predominately 110 or more, or the Veteran's systolic pressure is predominately 200 or more and neither of these levels are present.

Accordingly, the Board finds that a 10 percent disability evaluation for the Veteran's hypertension for the entire period on appeal is granted.
