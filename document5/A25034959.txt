REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran is represented by an accredited veteran service organization.  The information presented by the Veteran in the June 5, 2024, correspondence outlines a strategy and an intent on the part of the Veteran to withdraw his January 30, 2024, notice of disagreement.  See June 2024 Veteran Correspondence requesting "cancellation" of his appeal to the Board, and June 2024 VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, expressly noting the appeal to the Board was withdrawn so he could pursue that review option instead.

The Board finds this request to be "explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action on the part of the claimant."  See Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011)).
