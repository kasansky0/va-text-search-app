DOCKET NO. 211214-204897
DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of service connection for Parkinson's disease is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In September 2024, the appellant died while this appeal was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the appellant, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the U.S. Air Force from May 1955 to October 1978.  He died in October 2021.  The appellant was his surviving spouse.

This appeal started with a September 2021 rating decision denying the Veteran service connection for Parkinson's disease.  The Veteran died shortly thereafter in October 2021.  In December 2021, his spouse submitted a VA Form 10182 appealing the denial to the Board.  However, she had not yet been substituted in the Veteran's place.  Initially, in January 2022, the Board dismissed the appeal due to the death of the Veteran.  Later, in November 2023, the Board vacated the January 2022 decision because the appellant was not substituted in the Veteran's place, was not his fiduciary, and was otherwise not eligible to file the VA Form 10182.  It found the appeal should not have been docketed and the January 2022 decision should not have been issued.

The spouse appealed to the Court.  Unfortunately, she died in September 2024.  Because there was no one else seeking substitution, the Court vacated the November 2023 Board decision and dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.

Because the appellant has died, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the appellant's place to continue the appeal on the pending claim. This substitution process must be requested within one year of the appellant's death.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b).  Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

In this case, no one has requested to substitute for the appellant.  Any person who would like to request substitution must submit a VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant."  The form and filing instructions are available online at https://www.va.gov/find-forms/.  If the AOJ receives a request for substitution within one year of the appellant's death and then grants the request, this dismissed appeal will resume its place on the Board's docket.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).
